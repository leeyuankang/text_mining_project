we was woken at am by what i can only imagine was the shower water system of the room next to us not very pleasant for a sunday morning when we was hoping for a lay in it sounded like we was on a runway next to an airplane about to take off wouldn t stay there again for that reason only but also our room smelt like the sewers when u entered it coming from the bathroom
