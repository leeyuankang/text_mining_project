it was during christmas so this might have had an effect on their staff numbers it s not an excuse however the breakfast was poorly handled dirty floor and often with no glasses or cups for tea or coffee food was rarely brought in so part of the buffet was regularly empty it was an ok stay but bad value since it s not the cheapest option
