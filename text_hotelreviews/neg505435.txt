i shared an executive twin room with my other sister and was not impressed that this was called executive it did not look anything like the picture which was on booking com and there were very few pictures of the bathroom to see on line i would have liked to have seen a standard twin room to compare the toilet was placed in such a position that you had to sit on it sideways and my sister could not get wi fi on her phone
