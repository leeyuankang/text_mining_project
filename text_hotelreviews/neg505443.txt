original check in was in a very very small room when we advised that it was not acceptable they moved us to another room that room was fine except for the floor it squeaked everytime you walked over the area on the way to the bathroom we expected to have a bar and a workout facility and both were under construction i would not have booked this hotel if i had that information it was entirely too expensive for the lack of amenities there was also construction going on directly behind the hotel
