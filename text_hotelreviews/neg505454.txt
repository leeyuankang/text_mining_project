there was a major building site right next door which was a surprise the noise didn t affect us but access routes to the hotel were disrupted lined with barriers which doesn t give a very good impression of the location there was an early morning fire alarm evacuation from the hotel caused by a guest using an alarmed door the event wasn t very well managed by the night shift staff or the local fire brigade who were slow to turn up on foot presumably because they didn t know about the building works
