having booked with booking com we knew what the final amount to be paid to the hotel was but when we checked in the hotel said that there was an extra charge in relation to vat etc we paid this extra amount close to extra after looking at our booking confirmation again we spoke to reception upon checking out and they rectified the issue of overcharging us i say this just so others are aware
