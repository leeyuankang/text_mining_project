we did wait a little long for the dessert but this was down to an accident in the kitchen where the dessert plate was dropped we were kept informed of this by our waiter isaac who was excellent accidents happen so this is not really an issue i would ordinarily like to put in the do not like section but it meant that we had a rather late dessert but we stayed for far longer at the table than we should have anyway we were having so much fun the staff was very patient with us even though they had to set up for breakfast in the morning
