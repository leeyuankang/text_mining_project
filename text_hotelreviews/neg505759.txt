the hotel itself was great some guests were rather loud in the patio area which acts like an amplifier because of the architecture of the hotel the laughs and shouting could be heard right up to the seventh floor where we were i did not complain as it was easter and people were on holiday but shouting between balconies was not acceptable especially in the era of mobile phones this is not the hotel s fault though this is due to disrespectful and in many cases drunk people s fault although this shouting did not last too long my friend played mozart on the violin from the sixth floor balcony all the shouting stopped i reckon everyone thought it was coming from the heavens
