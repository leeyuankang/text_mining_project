we were exploring the hotel having a look at the hall rooms as we were thinking about having our wedding reception at the corinthia when a security man stopped us and asked us to leave immediate he wasn t very pleasant to us and made us feel very uncomfortable and un welcome this was a shame because up until that experience we were having such a lovely time the rest of the staff were amazing especially the hotel receptionists who made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable
