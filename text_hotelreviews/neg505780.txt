the concierge staff is not very helpful which is very surprising all other staff are so nice when i asked for assistance to change the number of persons for a lunch reservation at a restaurant he helped to call the restaurant passed the phone to me to talk to the restaurant directly i actually told him i needed to go out asked him to leave a message for me however he asked me to just wait a moment to see if he could get through i really didn t expect this kind of service from concierge from such a hotel
