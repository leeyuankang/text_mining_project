the set up on the room tv wasn t very good with some key uk channels missing and the screen seemed quite out of place at breakfast the staff didn t seem very engaged to help and the tables were small i was on a table for but once my plate and cup were there there was little room for anything else there didn t appear to be any toast on offer if there was it wasn t obvious or offered for some reason i can t explain i felt the least comfortable and relaxed on my own at breakfast during both dinners restaurant staff were charming courteous and attentive but not overly so at breakfast it was appeared that all that mattered was customer turn round rather than customer service
