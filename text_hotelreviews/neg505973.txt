extremely basic dorm style rooms with no facilities whatsoever had to run downstairs to reception to get a hairdryer and there wasn t even a bottle of water in the room checking in there was no one at reception and once a person finally came they spent mins in haggling about prices with another customer meanwhile the rest of us were kept waiting really unprofessional air con struggled to work and was impossible to adjust so room was stuffy and hot this is a very overrated hotel they seem to think that cool interiors are substitute to good service
