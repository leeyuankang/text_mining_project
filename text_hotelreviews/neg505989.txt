we had dinner at the hotel resturant and we had to wait forever for the waiter to take our orders then we waited almost an hour to get our food it wasn t a very busy night and we got no explanation or apologies other guests left because they had to wait for so long to get drinks we went back a couple of nights later and with different staff working things went much quicker
