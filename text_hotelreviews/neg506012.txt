the mattress was very squashy and could have done with an extra pillows as we only had each also the room was only cleaned for the first days of our stay and not on the last unsure why possibly our error as maybe we needed to place the hanging sign on the front of our door for it to be cleaned but this didn t seem the case for the first days
