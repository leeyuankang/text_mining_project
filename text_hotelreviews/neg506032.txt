booked an apartment on january and at the beginning of june i got an email informing me our apartment was undergoing renovations and was given bedrooms instead no living room kitchen etc as planned and we were put in bedrooms on different floors there didn t appear to be any renovations ongoing i do believe they rebooked our apartment at a higher price when i emailed to say this was not as i booked they told me i had an option to cancel but everything was much more expensive than when i originally booked in january so this wasn t an option for us there wasn t even an apology when we arrived at the hotel
