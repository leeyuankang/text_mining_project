the room was not soundproofed which we observed during the daytimes and resulted in a disrupted final night s sleep our complaint was taken by reception staff around and action has not yet been followed up by the hotel manager as promised we were situated in a corner suite and disappointed by the lack of privacy not forgetting the expense of the room we declined the option of sending security as our neighbours were only talking and vomiting not shouting or partying and did not feel they were at fault to escalate the situation
