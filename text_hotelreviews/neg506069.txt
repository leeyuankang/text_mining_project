the hotel is good but is really expensive for what we get unless it s the case for amsterdam hotel prices the room is not soundproofed at all we hear everything happening in the corridor and other rooms so bring your earplugs and we discovered that the bed board had been fixed with duct tape all of this didn t hinder our comfort or sleep much but an hotel at such night fees should be more careful about this
