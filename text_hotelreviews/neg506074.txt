the bathroom tub was designed by monkeys it had no shower curtain and the glass separator only extended out or feet from the shower head so what ended up happening each night was that a bunch of water would just splash out of the tub and onto the floor i got tired of moping up my mess every night and just ended up letting it evaporate off the floor but still it sucked
