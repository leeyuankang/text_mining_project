ckeck in is a bit late at however when i came even at my room was not ready i recieved a lot of appologieses from reception staff but you know it is hotel and i paid as for hotel there i do not support it i do not mind by which reason my room is not ready i was waiting for around till and then they gave me a key saying that as a bonus of their mistake i can have free breakfast at the hotel restaurant i thought just one day but then i discoverd that they included all my staying with breakfast however i did not understand it and did not use it because recepcion was like in panic during my check in they even did not ask my passport and did not give me a receipt of staying with my name and with information that i paid everything there the room was clean but not perfectly clean my mattress was like with big dint from someone fat who was sleeping there before me i did not ask to changed it because i wanted to enjoy the city but do not solve the problems it is hotel but you do not have access to cooking lounge and there is no fridge in the room why there is no safebox phone just phone to reception i did not get why this hotel is because if the hotel has new furniture hot water and heating that does not mean automatically to put this place to the high level yes of course i felt comfortable but for this price and stars i expected really more thank you
