the chambermaid service left something to be desired a stained undersheet was not changed a used milk capsule was not removed perhaps shortbread biscuits could be provided in additin to or instead of the oatmeal cakes the mini bar was so noisy an interrupted humming that after a disturbed first night we had to ask for it to be disconnected and lastly for disabled or elderly people the steps from the entrance up to reception are difficult to navigate and the lift doesn t stop at the entrance level a ramp of some kind would have been most helpful
