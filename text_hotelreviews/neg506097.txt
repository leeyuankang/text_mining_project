i was disappointed with the choice of food at breakfast for the price we were charged everything was very tasty however choice was limited and i found that the way bread was touched and cut by every other person was very unhygienic we arrived at the restaurant at around and there were no rolls left for us and only loafs of bread left i would also like to note that cups of coffee are tiny and coffee was luke warm
