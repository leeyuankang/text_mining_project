television stations were free to air and it showed not a great choice the system they had sometimes told you one show was being aired when in fact the show was a different one we asked for the detox juice on our first morning as per the breakfast menu to be told that the machine required to make it was broken the machine was still broken the next two mornings if i was running a star hotel i would have had the machine replaced immediately another option would have been to remove the item from the menu breakfast service could be improved maybe we had different expectations coming from ireland and maybe breakfast service works a different way in england i think it would be worthwhile for the hotel to send people undercover to the hotel and check how the breakfast service is they should use people from both english and other backgrounds and get their feedback personally while the staff were lovely and courteous at all times i believe this aspect of the hotel could be improved for example one morning we were given our tea and coffee at the beginning of breakfast we ate a cereal and then waited for our cooked breakfast our tea and coffee were cold by the time the cooked breakfast arrived we could have asked for more tea or coffee but i think staff should have been more attentive to something like this and asked us if we needed fresh tea or coffee due to the length of time involved i don t believe this is an issue with the staff but rather an issue with training
