each morning we mentioned to the staff member at the desk that the cable television was not working properly and would cut out half way through a program or movie it always seemed to come back for the dreaded tv ads we were told it would be looked at as i do not have a television at home it is a treat to watch it when i travel after a long day of visiting a city i was mildly annoyed that it was never fixed or that we were not told it could not be fixed which would have been fine too in the grand scheme this complaint is so minor when i consider what a great spot to stay it was keep up the good work
