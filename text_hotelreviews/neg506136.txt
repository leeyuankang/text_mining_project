our car was broken into in the secure car park that we were advised to park in after visiting the police station a police officer told us that he s had problems with the receptionists in the hotel not warning people that the car park is a hotspot for break ins also the receptionist admitted to us after we reported the break in that she doesn t park her car there because of the high chance of crime really disappointed with our stay and annoyed we listened to the advise to move our car from a secure car park to their not so secure car park very expensive stay for us and have had to continue our trip around the netherlands with a broken window
