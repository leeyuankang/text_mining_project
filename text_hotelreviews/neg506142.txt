the bed in our room was really uncomfortable and when we investigated further we discovered that there were three lats missing on both sides of the bed in fairness they were replaced the following day but the damage was already done to my back and sadly during our second night there was a lot of noise which apparently was because there was some sort of event downstairs so at there was a group of very nosy guests running around the corridors
