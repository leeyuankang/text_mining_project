the only thing i would suggest is to make it clear when breakfast starts and ends we were told when we checked in that breakfast went for an hour later on sundays however when we showed up at we were told a little sternly that breakfast had already ended and were told to find a table quickly and to leave quickly this was a bit disappointing as it slightly brought the experience down which thus far had been awesome
