breakfast service a joke very slow service better service in a star hotel fior breakfast ordered veggie breakfast with poached eggs and traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs the food came with the wrong eggs on both plates why bother with waitress service and writing down the food order if them the food delivered is wrong self service would be better great hotel but breakfast really let the hotel down
