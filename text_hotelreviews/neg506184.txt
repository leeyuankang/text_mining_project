i stayed there for nights but i was asked to change my bed for times the arrangement is the worst ever on weekends there were a large group of students booked the dormitory and the staff only cared about them but not the individual travellers the students were out at night and back in the midnight they were inconsiderate and made much noise until woken all individual travellers up and scolded them however the staff never helped the rooms were equipped with heaters but i was freezing for several nights even the corridors and toilets were as cold as fridge the showering facility is in old fashion and you have to press the button outside of the sprinkler when you are taking a shower under the cold weather there are not enough electric sockets in the rooms not enough lights either i would definitely ask anyone to reconsider whether to stay in this hostel i do think you have other choices in groningen
