our shower was broken the drain was clogged so after minute showering the bathroom was full of water and it started leaking also in the room we told the staff times total and every time they would tell us that they were on top of it and they would fix it but alas days with broken shower was what we had it was disgusting and the carelessness of the staff was astounding no compensation was offered not even an apology just indifference and at times annoyance on top of that the check in and check out process was simply dreadful one employee was happily chatting with tourists to give directions through the city the other was minding his own business it took minutes to check out seriously awful staff it s almost as if they are on holiday and happened to be there by mistake
