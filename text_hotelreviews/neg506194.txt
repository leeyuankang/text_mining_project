poor reception staff we had booked two of the larger rooms we were travelling as a family adults and teenage girls through booking com initially we were told that the hotel was absolutely full and that we could only have rooms at completely different ends of the very large hotel reluctantly we agreed only to find that one of the room was a very small double different to what we had paid for this had not been mentioned on the desk when we complained to the reception they were quite off hand saying that it was not their problem it was a problem with the cleaners finally when it was clear we were not going to be brushed off they miraculously found us the right type of room on the same floor as the girls the rooms were nice although a little cold when we did ask about how to turn up the heating a little again staff were unhelpful
