when we arrived there was an issue with finding us a room we had booked several weeks in advance but it seemed that our room had been given away to someone who had booked that day and arrived just before us it was fine as we were found a room however for minutes three staff at the check in desk argued amongst themselves about who had messed up making no attempt to hide this from us or apologise or explain what was going on a very unprofessional attitude and not a good first impression of the hotel
