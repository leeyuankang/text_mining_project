the things we didnt like were bathroom flooded everytime we d shower first time it almost flooded the room we had to call maintenance they showed up in a heartbeat and fixed it which could be solved by puting a sliding glass door to open and close shower and we wish we had a mini fridge there we bought cheese and a couple of sodas to drink and didnt have anywhere to keep them cool this is minor stuff though the hotel is great
