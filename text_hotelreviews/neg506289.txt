i was assigned to a ridiculously small room with no amenities at first for about euros a day my friend for the same price had a much better room after complaining they changed me to a large apt with complimentary water a safe a nespresso machine sort of what you expect from a decent hotel what i gather is that they just try to put solo travellers in the rooms they rent to long term students so avoid the individual room at all cost only the l room and the one just below it are worth staying
