extremely bad service giving impression when booing it of beeing a deal but was very disappointing very pricey yes i have been in amsterdam before and stayed at different hotels and not worth the money at all very hard beds small rooms no fridge written out that pets was allowed but only said they allowed service dogs after we paid and checked in happily after a long discussion they allowed us in since it would have been complicated to pay us back had to pay euro extra for hours late check out on departure day but cleaning staff walked in while sleeping times and woke us up from am in the morning and we had paid extra for getting some sleep seem to be no communication at all time they asked us but excuse us but when do you check out still other cleaners entered two times more no late food to get no room service or nothing staff recommended thuisbezorgd one soda candy machine in the main entrance which had not prices written out on it it was very expensive and did not give any change back i seem very bitter now but to be honest we are not picky but this was the worst hotel stay in our life and this is my first ever resume because i am o damn disappointed i really have to warn you
