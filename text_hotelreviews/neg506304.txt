bathroom would flood when the shower was used which happened in both rooms we were allocated it was a walk in shower which didn t have a suitable drainage system this meant that the toilet area would be wet whilst the shower area drained away we were allocated a second room because the air conditioning did not work in the first location was okay but you d need to get a taxi after as metros do not run after this or you could walk minutes final point we were not warned about the building works which were happening during the week until we arrived drilling between am to we understand building works have to take place but we should have had warning prior to our booking as this would have been a factor that we would have taken in to account on whether to stay here or not my partner is a builder and he was rather looking forward to getting away from work on our holiday not being reminded of it haha
