although the staff answered all of our questions about public transport it would have been very helpful to have printed information available on how to find our way to significant destinations in the city how to buy a metro ticket how to find a tourist centre how to get to the rijksmuseum etc it was actually easy to work this out but older tourists can become anxious about such things
