there was no safe in the room where i was which didn t turn out to be a problem but i would have been a bit more relaxed had there been one when i asked staff at reception about this they seemed very surprised that i thought that was important i d also asked staff by email beforehand helps to know and they told me there there would be safes but it turned out they were only in suites to me it is standard industry practice to have safes in hotel rooms just like having a hairdryer which you had to borrow from reception but then again this isn t your standard hotel and what it lacks in facilities it makes up for in other areas cleaning wasn t as thorough as in your regular hotel either and there were no bedside tables to put your stuff on which made the room appear messier none of these things were that important to me personally but could potentially annoy someone else who is used to having these facilities in rooms i am only comparing it to others i have experienced in this price range as by the way
