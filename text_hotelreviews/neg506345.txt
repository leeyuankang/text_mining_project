very disappointed by the breakfast we stayed two nights and the front guest agent told us that we could have breakfast for p day p pers instead of we were not sure so she said if you dont like it come back and we ll take it off in the morning no menu at the entrance so we gave room number and big disappointment very poor choice and even the milk was lacking was obliged to run after the waiter to get me some surprising for a rooms hotel the few things that i ate was really not that good just for juice and cereals pass your way when we went to front desk to say we didnt want breakfast for the second day she said its too late you took the discount and ate already so we had to eat this poor breakfast a second time honestly pass your way and go to a caf for breakky there is some on the same street
