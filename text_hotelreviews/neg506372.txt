too far from the center of the city for walking tourist cleaning is made up once in days towels weren t changed for days but maybe it was our fault and the towels should be dropped on the floor like a sign to be changed don t know the shampoo and the shower gel also weren t changed for days when we asked at the reception to change them on day nothing was done it wasn t the cleaning day of our room but we put a sticker it willl be good for some cleaning but it didn t helped
