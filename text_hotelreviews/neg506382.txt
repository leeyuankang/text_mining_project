the only thing i did not appreciate was the bunk beds i had requested two single beds instead of a double bed because i was travelling with a friend and not a spouse so i confirmed it with the hotel that my request had been taken care of which they did confirm but never did they mentionned it was bunk beds being both in our s it was not easy for me to climb and get down from the top bed
