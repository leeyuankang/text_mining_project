unfortunately the staff at the hotel were not particularly helpfulike and had little knowledge of the area we twice asked for a hair dryer and were told they had run out and would contact us when one was available which never happened we also requested smaller pillows on the bed as ours were massive and gave us beck ache but again never heard back from the staff
