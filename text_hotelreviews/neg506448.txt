room service is low don t expect a real start hotel the cleaners only make the bed and put towels nothing else no toothpaste body shampoo bottle was empty we had to go and pick it up in reception they won t bring it to you we stayed for night they didn t even change the dirty glasses on table we had to wash it in bathroom or put new bottle of water or sort the messiness in room shower was small breakfast not worth the price
