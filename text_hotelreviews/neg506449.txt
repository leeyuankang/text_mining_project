the breakfast was not worth the extra money spent on a breakfast inclusive tariff if i knew the breakfast would be so simple and limited i would rather have saved the extra money and spent it on a nice breakfast outside of the hotel in the cafes around the city it s bad that they sadly don t have fridges in the rooms to store drinks or foods that visitors typically want to buy and store also that standard rooms such as the one my brother had don t have any safe deposit boxes only deluxe rooms have this it was also a hassle to ensure that i had the exact change to pay for my bike rentals because they never offer or store any change there and i ended up walking around looking for change wasting so much time
