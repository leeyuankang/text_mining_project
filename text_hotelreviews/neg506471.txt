my deluxe room really took me back to my university days looked very much like my student accommodation normally i m not overly fussy but i d expect to have a coffee machine or at least a kettle available in my room in a hotel a hair dryer and some shower gel would also be nice i paid for the worst hotel breakfast i ve ever had and i do travel a lot all in all it was an ok ish very basic experience far from a hotel
