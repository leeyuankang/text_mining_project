i think calling the room we were in a twin room probably amounts to false advertising it certainly was not a twin room as it had a double bed and so that made the stay a bit awkward as we had not anticipated that we would have to share a bed apparently there are no twin bed rooms in the hotel but if this is the case please don t call the room type a twin room as this gives the wrong idea i understand that if one clicks on the room type there is a fuller description given saying it has a double bed but this is not really enough in my mind the room type really needs to be renamed or preferably separate beds should be installed
