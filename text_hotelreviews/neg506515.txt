i was most distressed to arrive back on my second day to my hotel room in the afternoon to discover all my baggage and clothes removed from my room there was clearly a lack of communication between staff working in the hotel as my check out day was two days later the situation got eventually resolved and my baggage was returned to my room but as i remained near the reception area i did not think staff appreciated how serious the situation was and in my opinion took far too long to get it resolved i had already booked and paid for the three nights using booking com and shows a lack of organisation in the hotel if i had returned back to the hotel later that evening or that night the question arises would all my baggage still have been retained and returnable to me i have travelled to holland before and stayed in different cities and hotels and i have never experienced this level of incompetence as i was concerned the hotel could be so incompetent enough to do it again the next day i had to take time out from my travel group to return to the hotel in the afternoon to check my luggage was there the rest of my travel group were staying in different hotels and could not believe what had happened to me and remarked that they were glad they had not booked in my hotel
