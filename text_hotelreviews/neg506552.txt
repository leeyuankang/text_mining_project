with the hotel being open to the public and the street especially at breakfast time security was very bad and i had my handbag stolen while having breakfast while the incident was captured on cctv it appears no one was actually monitoring the camera at the time of the incident and the alarm was only raised when i missed my handbag it was quite a problem as it was the beginning of a three week holiday and all my credit cards and cash were now gone
