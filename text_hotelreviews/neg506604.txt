the cleaning staff on two occassions came in to my room barely announced and offered to clean which would be fine if i was not about to have a shower on both occassions i asked if they wouldn t mind coming back later and left the sign on my door to make sure both times i came back to my room as it was it was days before my room was cleaned and nothing was restocked considering it wasn t fully stocked in the beginning this was particularly frustrating the other thing i noticed is the lock on the heating at degrees i get really cold easily and was sick so this wasn t ideal i liked it here but it was more like a hostel with private rooms than a hotel i couldn t entirely relax here
