the only issue i had was that booking com had made an error meaning that there was two bookings under my name and confirmation number when i only made one booking luckily i picked the option that meant i paid upon arrival and so was able to sort out the issue before being charged for two rooms however i feel as though i may have been charged for the type of room that we didn t stay in which is annoying however this is not so much the fault of the hotel and more of booking com
