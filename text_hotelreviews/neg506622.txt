a step up to the bathroom caused me to trip once and stumble forwards and stub my foot once as i wasn t expecting it to be there because usually rooms are single level so i put a bright white towel down on the tiled step where it met the main room carpet which made the step easily visible from then on probably wasteful of a clean towel not great in a highly environmentally friendly hotel but it was definitely a safer option it s in a mainly residential working part of the city but was an easy hop by train to everywhere you d want to go
