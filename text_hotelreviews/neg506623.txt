breakfast was not like breakfast in an attempt to be ubercool the presentation seemed more important than choice or taste if you don t eat porc or cheese there is hardly anything left only choice of break was toast or dry sour dough bread it seemed like an end of afternoon aperitif buffet rather than breakfast very small room for the price
