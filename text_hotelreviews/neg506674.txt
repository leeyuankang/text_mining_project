the price of a single room was very expensive and the room was tiny with a not so nice view i found it to be very overpriced breakfast was not a buffet instead you could either opt for a menu for a fixed price choose from a specific list of items or buy items not on the list separately the hotel was about a half hour walk from the city center it was a pleasant walk as we lucked out with good weather but may be a bit long for other people or in rainy weather
