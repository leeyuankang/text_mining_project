as a traveler people tend to forget to pack tidbits so i think to include toothbrush toothpaste in the bathroom would be beneficial for the customers you have the option to turn on the air con but due to them being environmentally friendly you can only turn the air up to degrees so it was a bit pointless anyways but a bit hot for the summer also as i stayed on floor i can hear every water gushing noise as i sleep which was really irritating and unpleasant
