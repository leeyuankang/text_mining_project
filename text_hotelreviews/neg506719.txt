my negative about the room was that there was no no tea and coffee making facilities i thought you would have access to a kitchen which is not true if you stay as a hotel guest so the only way to get tea or coffee is to buy from a vending machine in my room there was a large poll post in the corner i am assuming it holds up the building but took up a lot of room i ve marked down for breakfast as it s ready made so if like me you have any allergies i m gluten free there is nothing you can eat if though you are a standard eater it looked great and good value for money the vending machines are expensive nearly euros for a bottle of coke
