well i asked for a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel i confirmed twice with the hotel desk personnel weeks prior to my arrival i even had email proofs on the day i arrived at the airport i was appalled to find out there will be no shuttle service because they weren t sure which terminal to pick me up i came to paris with my twins i was hoping there d be a cab waiting for us instead we all had to take the train to the hotel then i asked if they have an iron facility they said they don t so i asked if i could get an iron so i could press my clothes they promised to get me one day after day until nothing happened and i had to knock on everyone else s door to ask for one there was also a time where none of our electric devices worked turned out our power circuit got turned off not sure how that happened it was a nightmare
