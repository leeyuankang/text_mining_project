i made reservation via booking which allowed me free cancellation until day before arrival for some reason the whole amount for our stay was already charged when we came i don t know if it is a hotel or booking com new policy but this is the first time it happened i was concerned because i wanted to pay with different card and only after i see the room when i pointed it out at the reception they were ready to offer me a different solution and very helpful
