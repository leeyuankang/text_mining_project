the rooms were tiny but i think that is normal for this area of paris our shower was broken for the entire days they offered to move us but they couldn t move our kids too so we would have been separated the elevator was broken for days and we were on the the floor luckily we already had our large suitcases up to our rooms they never replenished the shampoo coffee etc said there were irons and robes in the room but there is not one iron for the entire motel that was always being used most of the staff were not that helpful or knowledgeable about places to eat in the area told us to go to mcdonalds when we asked for ice cream
