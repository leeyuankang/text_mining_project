noise of metro trains we were in the back part of the hotel on the third floor out of eight and could hear the trains passing beneath us it did not stop us sleeping as we were so tired but it could have been a problem we did not spend much time in the room also piles of rubbish were outside before the bin men came and the breakfast was not worth it but plenty of other places nearby
