we booked adjacent deluxe rooms we were put into adjacent standard rooms it was only because i noticed the mistake that it was acknowledged however due to the hotel occupancy level and being late in the afternoon it wasn t possible to provide the rooms we had paid for and with only days in paris we lost over an hour of our first day trying to remedy the situation compensation was offered but at the time of writing this the refund that was promised has not happened
