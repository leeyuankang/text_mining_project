we were two couples checking in at the same time one room was ready and as it turns out was significantly bigger times including the huge bathroom than the room given to couple number two whose room was tiny a little bit bigger than the bed and came with drilling at about am the next morning directly above so my feedback would be to give two couples checking in at the same time the same size accommodations
