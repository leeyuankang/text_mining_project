i was very disappointed with various things which i would have expected from a four star hotel the light in front of the mirror in the bathroom was out and had not been attended to there was no place to hang the shower head only one of the beds had been made with a valise and decoration it looked very odd that the other twin bed had not felt like we had to keep the curtains shut at all times because the window door went straight onto an internal staircase wouldn t expect this from a superior room we had to specifically ask for coffee in order to use the machine in the morning finally the staff seemed a little glum and weren t the most welcoming
