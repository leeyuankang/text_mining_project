the bath didn t have a curtain or screen appeared to be broken the room was incredibly small but this is pretty normal for paris and the stairs down to the room from the door were very odd it felt like a very standard experience and i would have expected it to be a little nicer than it was for the price sadly from experience hotels in paris seem to lack the actual feel often
