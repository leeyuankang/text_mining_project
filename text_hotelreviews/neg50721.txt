coffee machines are trendy but i do prefer a kettle there were only small milk pots and coffee pods i asked for some more milk but none came stole some from breakfast next day and kept it in minibar the reception staff were inattentive and much preferred to socialise with their friends than help guests the breakfast staff were fantastic though the worst thing was we had to pay another tax on top of our bill which he said was the hotel tax not the tax that we had already paid to booking com i shall be taking this up when we get back to england as i want an explanation why we had to pay tax twice an extra will not be using best western again if this is their policy
