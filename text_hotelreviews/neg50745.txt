i had one of the worst traveling experiences this was suppose to be a star hotel where i paid a sum of money only to be disrespected by a taxi driver contacted by the hotel when i reported the incident i was left with apathy no appologies or even getting back to me with a reaponse the hotel itself is definetely not a stars one it is barely stars i was at first accomodated in a lousy room where cleanliness was a huge issue when i complained i was offered after the night to be moved into a better one which was probably the only good gesture the staff offered however still the hotel did not meet the stars expectations at all
