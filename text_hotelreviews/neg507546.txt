customer service and contact by two staff members who were rude only one out of staff we dealt with at the front counter was pleasant lady with the bob haircut was fabulous the breakfast staff were amazing though on both days we were upgraded to a suite the first night and this room was fine the air con worked well and the bed was comfortable the second night we got transferred to a standard room which was like a box very jammed with poor aircon we had a shocking nights sleep on very uncomfortable beds singles pushed together to make a double bed in the end we opened up the window lay the duvet below us for comfort as this was better than the noisy hot and cold experience we were getting the staff member wasn t very helpful at midnight regarding the air con so overall it was a shame to have this negative experience in such a beautiful city we would not stay at this hotel again simple things like consistent manners air con that worked properly good towels and a softer mattress would have made this the perfect place to stay interestingly enough the hotel seemed to have put better mattresses air con in the suite we had on the first night we ve stayed all over the world and feel this hotel could do better
