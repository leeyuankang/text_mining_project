absolutely appalling that when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night i saw no staff and absolutely appalling that the next morning there wasn t even a board saying what had caused the alarm and apologising a complimentary breakfast or something it would put me off coming again especially as in the morning all fire doors were jammed open probably illegally i haven t had the energy to complain but i was staying in a hotel rather than a train to get a good nights sleep no staff visible in any way in the middle of the night
