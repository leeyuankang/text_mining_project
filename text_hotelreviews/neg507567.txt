it must also be said that if you want to stay close to die innere stadt near the cathedral of st stephan it is not a short walking distance to those areas however why bother when the u bahn tickets do not cost a fortune a day card ticket might cost you approx eur and it brings you to the very center of the city within minutes after a min walk form the hotel entrance
