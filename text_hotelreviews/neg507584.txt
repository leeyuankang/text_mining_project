the hotel seems old and not in a good way but outdated i find it really hard to think of things that may have changed there during the past years apart from the wifi one example to prove my point which is almost funny the tvs are not only ancient but they are also black white i almost thought this is on purpose to create some vintage feel but that s not the case better no tv than having a super cheap black white tv on the desk how much could it cost to upgrade this now i don t care about tv in general and especially not on holiday but i m just saying the hotel facade could do with a bit of refurbishment as the balconies are rusty and you don t want your hotel to look like a hotel at most on the inside i would give it because it looks nice and it is really clean but certainly not the breakfast is good and there is choice but it s otherwise pretty basic also at i d expect my bed to be a double bed not a combination of single beds i think an old look would do really well especially in a hotel in vienna but that doesn t mean nothing should ever be changed some things need to brought into the century
