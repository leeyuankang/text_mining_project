this hotel should be rated as star hotel the mattress was uncomfortable and had a dent in the middle it wasn t flat the carpet had stains and the whole room had a bit of a worn down feeling to it with humidity stains and scratched walls see photos wi fi didn t work in the room the signal was too weak it was the first time in a star hotel that i called the reception to have wine glasses and a corkscrew delivered to the room and got asked to go to the hotel bar and ask if they have it breakfast was a little disappointing with overcooked bland scrambled eggs supermarket cakes being served and horrible coffee
