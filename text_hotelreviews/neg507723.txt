one receptionist is not nice at all he is young and he tries hard to look important and cool and the only time he smiled was when he tried to make fun of me for one simple question i had the impression that i was the receptionist and he was the client message to him you should look for another job all other personnel we met were very nice and friendly one more bad thing i booked months in advance and when i booked i asked for a room on the highest floor please but when we arrived we were given a room not even close to the highest floor so there is no point in asking for something in the booking when not even months are enough to have it
