this is the worst hotel i ve been in my life the receptionist told us that we got an exclusively non smoking room but the room smelt very bad it was clearly a smoking room it smelt also from alcohol there was an empty bottle and a broken glass under the bed there was no soap and shampoo in the bathroom the bathroom is very small very hard to have a shower there s no parking we had to park our car on the street and we almost had a car accident the breakfast was very poor the hotel is dirty the staff is poor definetely do not reccomend this hotel
