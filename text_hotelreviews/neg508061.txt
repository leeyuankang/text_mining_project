the main problem is the lack of air conditioning in the rooms which they kindly inform you about on check in we were lucky enough to be in vienna when temperatures were over and although there was a ventilator in the room it was very little help the other problem is the noise outside we had two choices sweat with closed windows or don t sleep because of the noise we chose sweating all this wouldn t have been a problem if there had been air conditioning in the room and this would be a star review i wouldn t have booked here if it were made obvious on the website that there s no air conditioning i think it s a basic expectation to have air conditioning in a hotel that s supposed to be accommodation we had an okay stay but i ll never book here again
