the room was terrible hot like sauna so there wasnt aircontition just fan and they gave me smll extra fan but it didnt help and cleaner colosed windows of fans when they cleaned so room was really hot when i came back if this hotel is fours stars hotell they should have aircondition not only at reception and restaurant
