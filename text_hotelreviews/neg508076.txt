no air conditioning at all in the rooms only a fan rooms were really hot during the day night and the fan was helpful only to some extent making it really hard to sleep at night basically my wife and i had nearly no sleep during our stay because of the hot rooms we brought up the lack of air conditioning and sleep due to hot rooms at the check out but the response was that they are planning to install a c in nobody really cared how we felt i would really not recommend staying at this place if air conditioning is a real factor for you otherwise i would recommend it if you are not really picky about where you stay in vienna location to the shopping area is about a min walk breakfast and staff were really good
