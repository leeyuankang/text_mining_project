when i booked there was a question asking if i wanted a quiet room given that quite a few reviews mentioned noise i said yes i was then told i would have to pay an extra per night which i agreed to however on arrival i realized i would have been better off with a regular room as they had better natural light and air flow our room was very stuffy as the windows opened onto a courtyard there was a small fan in the room but it didn t work also i didn t think it was in a noisy location anyway
