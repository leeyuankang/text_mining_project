we found the lack of air conditioning a slight problem traffic trams in particularly was too loud to have windows open at night and though the central heating was off the room was always very warm with a window open the trams went past like high speed army tanks but if closed the noise was a rumble like an underground tube station with the train arriving before you get to the platform the room had a stand alone fan but this was too noisy to use all night i m not sure what we would have done had it been the middle of summer a second problem for my wife and i both preferring to use the shower rather than bath was the shower over the bath the bath was relatively narrow and therefor more curved on the bottom resulting in uneven standing area with a high risk of slipping even without soap perhaps a non slip bath mat to place in the bath may solve the problem also the safety rail needs to be higher for showering than for bathing
