in our room toilet was separated from the bathroom it was not even close to bathroom very uncomfortable on the day we ran out of shampoo and had to go and pick it up because they didn t have anyone to bring it to the room also we ran out of soap on the day they use big bottles of shampoo and soap so probably no one checked if there is enough before we arrived
