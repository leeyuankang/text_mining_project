the bedroom turned out to be a little smaller than expected i had requested a quiet room at the time of booking but was given one overlooking the main road wiedner hauptstrasse the hotel had emailed me after booking to offer a quiet room facing the courtyard for an additional euros per night but in order to keep in budget i declined the offer the trams run right outside the hotel but they become less frequent at night and seem to stop completely between around midnight and so it wasn t excessively noisy it was freezing cold outside but the hotel is very well heated in fact our room was small and possibly a little too well heated and insulated there was no air con in the room so had to turn the radiatiors off and open the windows to let some heat out also took the duvet out of its cover and used that as a sheet over me instead of sleeping under the duvet at least the hotel was well heated though far better to be too hot than too cold just small points to note really they didn t impact too much on our stay
