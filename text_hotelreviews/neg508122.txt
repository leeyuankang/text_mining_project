the location leaves a lot to be desired we took a taxi to the hotel from the main railway station for eur by local taxi and eur backward by uber and there is minutes to get to the old town on foot from the hotel some decades ago the hotel was on its top but now it is rather old fashioned there are no queen king size beds in the hotel just only two single beds split together take care of your money when the hotel charges the sum after you book a room they charged us times the required amount within hours and returned our money back only after long negotiations with the hotel
