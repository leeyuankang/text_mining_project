i paid a room with courtyard view which was the most expensive one on booking asking for a double bed also when we check in we received room which had a strange bathroom the toillet and the rest of the bathroom are in separate rooms meaning that if you go to the toillet you have to wash your hands in the other bathroom but only after you pass through the bedroom i ask for another room and i received one only the next morning after one unpleasant discussion with the male receptionist who tried to convince me an eastern europe doctor that this bathroom is something very common for their country and also hygienic this is unacceptable for a four star hotel in wien
