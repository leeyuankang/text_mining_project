the weather was hot and the hotel has no air conditioner having had a fan was good but it was not enough for the hot weather when we were there we booked a courtyard view room and we paid extra for it and it turns out the room overlooks literally a tin roof no view of any kind at all and when we mentioned this the first time to the night shift receptionist he told us we need to talk to his colleagues in the morning when we mentioned it again while paying for our stay at check out they said that what we had was in fact the courtyard view in my opinion this is a rip off and a big fail on their part
