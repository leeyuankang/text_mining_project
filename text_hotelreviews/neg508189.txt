the staff was friendly but we pre booked a car park for two nights which we ended up not needing and we were disappointed they werent able to refund us at all they didn t offer any type of compensation for this out of pocket payment we couldn t get back which was very disappointing to us even a small discount on the restaurant or something little would ve been nice for that money we spent and weren t able to get back the room is also incredibly hot at night to be expected for july when we stayed but no ac is something to be aware of and the fan in the room wasn t super helpful
