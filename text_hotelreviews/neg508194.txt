we had a room on the fourth floor with no aircon and only a very small and old fashioned fan available with temperatures over we could hardly sleep at night the toiletries consisted of a small bar of soap for the two of us and liquid soap shampoo in the shower the former wasn t replaced with a new one and the latter run out and wasn t filled up when the room was redone after the first night
