when i arrived in the room and wanted to take some mineral water from the minibar i noticed that it contained an open half empty bottle which must have been left by previous guests i reported this to the reception despite reporting it at check out i was presented with a bill for three bottles instead of one plus a charge for an adapter that i had never ordered this was quickly taken off the bill but had i not checked the bill i would have been over charged by euros this has never happened before at this hotel i have stayed here many times
