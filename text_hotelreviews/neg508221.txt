we had a room at the front of the hotel and couldn t sleep for the first two nights as a tram passed every minute until very late we asked if we could move to the back of the hotel yes we could for another a night to a much smaller room which we had to take them up on if we were to sleep for another nights the hotel takes about guests yet the breakfast room holds about during busy periods the overflow finishes up in the bar evening restaurant we ate there one evening and found the food poor and expensive there are a lot of excellent restaurants nearby
