the bed it was very uncomfortable we stay for six nights and every morning we had pain in our back also as i said we stay for nights and we run out of soap and shower gel and they didn t even noticed it to change or to refill it the room was small but ok we had view in the skylight which wasn t good at all last i didn t like the fact that they had a tortoise in a small font under the staircase and they forced the tortoise to stay on a piece of wood on a rock outside the water and the poor tortoise was trying badly for hours to get into the water i felt ungry about that
