the internet was very weak almost impossible to use there was no drinking opportunity at the sauna which wasn t very pleasent also there was construction in the hotel it is understandable that it needs renovation from time to time but i think it is not acceptable that the information about the work and the incredibly loud noise from am to is only provided at the venue after i checked in it should have appeared already when i booked the room on booking com since once i arrived i could not cancel my accomodation for free which put me in a very uncomfortable position
