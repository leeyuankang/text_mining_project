non smoking hotel wants to be very design oriented but it isn t nice room however no bottle of water in the room shower makes the complete bathroom wet nice idea to have an imac in the room serving as internet access tv entertainment welcome staff was not really friendly check out went smooth no scrambled eggs at breakfast other food were ok nice cocktails in the bar close to the city center street rooms are kind of noisy paid eur more than my college who also booked via booking com very bad
