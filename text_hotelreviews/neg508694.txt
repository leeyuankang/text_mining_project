the huge minuses for me were no wifi in my room fifth floor restarting the router didn t help at all so that was pretty disappointing as i need internet for my work i will have to select another hotel next time in wien another point is that there was somebody smoking inside their rooms and the cigarette smell was all over the corridor and staircases although it is stated as a non smoking hotel this is not a fault of stuff though
