the whole room was a bit outdated but clean the windows looked at the street which were busy with trams passing regularly under the windows therefore the room was very noisy i had to use earplugs for sleeping and i had to turn on the air conditioning instead of opening the windows it is not recommended for long stay although the room would be big enough
