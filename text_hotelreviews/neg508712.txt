the breakfast was one of the poorest i have experienced for the price we only paid for it for day and decided to buy our own food though on check out we were told we had been to breakfast days something the hotel needs to look at as you just say your room number maybe show your key too fortunately they believed us and we were not charged for the other day curtains had lost some of backing which meant more light came through early in the morning
