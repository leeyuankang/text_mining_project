basically everything in this hotel reflects the greediness of the owner the tv is a model from i checked just like probably everything in the rooms the beds are squeaky windows are simple layer and for those which open on the main street half of them it s very noisy even at night the wifi doesn t work it s basically a basic subscription that is shared among all the guests and staff it is fine if you use internet when nobody does but you can t use at any time in the evening i couldn t even download a pdf properly the breakfast is ok but still low standard compared to what you can get at this price in vienna there was an uncomfortable remanent smell in the bathroom i just can t believe this hotel is still surviving with all the competitors and the airbnb around i do not recommend i don t blame the staff they do the best they can with what they have it s just that the owner and the management are absolutely awful
