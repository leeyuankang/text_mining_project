i would not recommend this place in a million years the man in the reception when we arrived on the afternoon of the was the rudest and most unpleasant man i have ever come across if you want someone to treat you with disrespect and make you feel bad stupid and useless for no evident reason come here it took him two seconds to be rude from the moment we arrived and he was equally unpleasant impertinent and unhelpful throughout our stay i m sure not all staff are as bad as him we did met one nice man when checking out but just in case i would recommend booking another hotel
