we had a very small room on the top floor and getting into the right side of the bed meant being very careful to not hit your head also the glass holding the spoons had lipstick inside of it which made us wonder how clean the other items were the refrigerator wasn t working but we didn t need it and forgot to mention it on check out the furnishings were looking a little worn and there was plaster peeling off of the wall around the window
