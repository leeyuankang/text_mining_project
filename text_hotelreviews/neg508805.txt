poor breakfast with all the tables dirty all the time one lady was there but moving slowly or even absent and this happened consecutive mornings the breakfast was more like a star hotel not probably they think eastern europeans that visit them don t know too much about living a good life we stayed nights and they never changed the towels the bath is small and the water is flowing on the floor they should look at the bottom of the bath s door the pink is gone for some years now
