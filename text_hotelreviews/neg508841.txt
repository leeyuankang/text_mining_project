i had an extremely bad experience with the receptionist mrs ivanova who made me crazy public scene at the restaurant hysterical calling me a criminal just because i wanted to pay with my husbands credit card that is connected to my booking com account later anyway i agreed on paying cash still this lady was harassing me all the time i am completely shocked by this impossible behaviour and would warn other tourists of this particular unbalanced lady never ever i would enter the same hotel
