it s not at all worth the stars i really don t know how they go them the rooms look really old a refresh wouldn t hurt out of date beverages in the minibar when we complained we got another bottle offered but it still appeared on the bill at the end of our stay very poor breakfast not in terms of quantity but no fresh products ham is the cheapest you can find in any store bread was still frozen in the middle marmelade and cereals with really weird tastes the staff was clearly incompetent and didn t understand german when we arrived for breakfast there were empty tables but not cleaned no clean plates no bowls no glasses we had basically to prepare our table ourselves collecting from other tables we had to wait until we got some refill in bread cheese there was no butter etc etc the next day we went to a small coffee shop next door to have breakfast the heating in the bedroom did not work properly it was on off but it was still around degrees in there no proper shampoo just the usual soap no body milk and other products no cotton sticks no cotton pads and in the end we couldn t even tell them all those points as they didn t even asked us how our stay was while paying bref really no stars service
