we booked our room here it means we havent seen it before after we arrived we realised we had to small child and i write this on the reservation the big room is enough for us there was to separated place wich would perfect my mother can taking care of them but the staff sad for us its imposible to change our reservation we can do next time i think this is not a polite way and when we payed they charge extra money for the childrens what we already payed
