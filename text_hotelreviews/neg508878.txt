our room was at the end of the hall and the wifi was not working at all none of our devices were able to connect since the signal was too weak had i known this before i would have never booked this hotel the staff members didn t seem to care much about this and always lied about how they never had this problem before they offered us to switch rooms but the next day when i came down to do it they were always full i had to go down to the lobby to use the wifi which was a real inconvenience
