we were woken at again at on the first night with other guests shouting kicking the door to their room when we asked to keep the noise down were abused swore at the manager claimed it wasn t a fault of the hotel then offered us to move rooms however the room wasn t available until cleaned therefore we went out for the day only to be called back halfway through our tour of london to move before other guests checked in furthermore ruining our day by cutting it short there was no apology by the manager as the noise went on from i am sure there will be further complaints from other guests on floor it also questions why the night duty staff allowed this woman to disturb other guests throughout the night rather than give her access to the room with another key we called reception twice heard them tell her there had been noise complaints but it still continued a lovely hotel but for a night we stayed nights a decent nights sleep is what we wanted but did not get utterly disappointed as this was a birthday weekend away
