visited in september when the temperature was still in the high s air conditioner unit was quite noisy however it did drown out the conversation noise from the bar across the road if you switched off the air conditioner it was too hot to close the window hence the issue with the conversation noise from the bar it should be noted that the bar was not one with loud music that went all night it was just the sound of conversation
