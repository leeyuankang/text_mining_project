during breakfast it would be good not only to have pork meat and turkey but also chicken the breakfast area is a little cramped bad ventilation you can feel all breakfast smells in your room during breakfast time it would also be good if hotel would turn to card keys to open and lock doors there is also a building renovation near the hotel only during working hours not much disturbance though as windows are soundproofed
