very small lift just one and restaurant the breakfast could be better when i made the reservation i requested rooms close to each other and it was not attended in fact the rooms were in separate floors in my opinion a total lack of attention since i booked in advance hot rooms no air conditioner to minimize the problem the staff recommends to open the window
