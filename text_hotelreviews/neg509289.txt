for this kind of price and a star hotel really a big disappointment the shower in our room was high and situated in our bath after asking for a normal shower because i m meter and couldn t shower the staff said that s your problem but if you want to pay more we can give you a room with a walk in shower the two rooms we saw were both very dated no one was taking care of the entrance or was taking the entrance serious we had to arrange our luggage ourself and even the taxi s we arranged ourself after two times no help with the taxi s we decided to use our uber app from that moment which suddenly suddenly wasn t appreciated by the doormen it was an unpleasant surprise especially because we came back after two years because we liked the hotel our first stay very much and had our first anniversary there
