first what made me very unhappy is that there is renovation going on and this should have been somehow informed by hotel or by booking web site or at least have discounted rate breakfast overpriced although good quality no nespresso machine or tea in room not big deal but for such price could be included hotel not bad but definately overpriced if you are expecting something cool and super luxury it is not it and will not make any difference if you choose a good star hotel but way cheaper be careful when booking they will charge you extra taxes on everything room price food etc which will make your total bill look surprising i guess it is common around some london hotels and restaurants my bill per day became gbp with breakfast for instead of booked so if you don t care about money go for some higher price hotels like four seasons dorchester or jumeirah as there you feels real star
