the hotel is poor value for money the loo in the room i had must have been designed by someone who never tried to get to it stuck up against a cupboard and behind the open door the staff are smiley but some are not very competent the restaurant is expensive breakfast with totally unjustified service charges applied automatically the hot food was reasonably warm but pre prepared and straight out of the bain marie so limp and tasteless tip walk along the road to the chamberlain and have breakfast for half the price and three times the value
