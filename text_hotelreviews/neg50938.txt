i had ordered some food with deliveroo and the driver was not allowed to deliver the food to my door i had to get changed and pick up my food from reception also i was not able to give the deliveroo driver a tip as they had already left i was told by reception that they do not allow them to deliver direct to my door despite this being allowed during my previous stay i have eaten the room service food provided by the hotel many times and it s delicious but the menu has not changed in over a year which is why i ordered deliveroo
