our first room standard double was a joke it was hardly big enough for one let alone nice big bed that took up the whole room tiny space for a wardrobe no drawers and nowhere to put toiletries or make up etc i had all of mine on the floor bathroom tiny again nowhere to put anything good job we are small and thin we were going to order room service after a long drive however no surface to put the tray let alone eat unless you sit on the bed to eat we sat in the bar area instead and it was absolutely freezing we asked for a different room but couldn t get one til the next day the duty manager was nice giving us free drink vouchers however couldn t do anything else that eve next day we got moved to a much bigger nicer room at the front of hotel however same size bathroom and again nowhere to put toiletries etc this hotel probably only suitable for a night stay and bathrooms only suitable for smaller people would not go back
