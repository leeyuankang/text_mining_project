the room was small really poor value for money we booked a twin and were given a double when we asked were told they would separate the beds no one came to do this and we arrived back so late and tired we didn t want to request it be done so had to put up with it don t understand why it wasn t done ready for our arrival the service in the bar was poor there were staff but i was ignored its fine if people are busy but one person was just stacking glasses and a polite nod to say you ll be served any minute would be good the hotel pre authorised my credit card on check in and although i checked out hours ago that money is still being held
