the building work that was going on that we weren t notified of having to walk through very dusty corridors that had danger no entry written on them to get to our room it seemed we were the only ones in that part of the hotel and it was really dirty as around twenty rooms were being referbished and when i say refurbished i mean it was back to the brick walls hence the dust this was not up to standard when we were clean and ready for a night day out
