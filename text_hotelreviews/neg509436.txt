the room was so small it was impossible for two grown adults to move around in comfortably it was more suited to a single room and bed very uncomfortable and almost claustrophobic we were with friends and almost impossible to all squeeze in to share a drink following our night out we managed in the morning with one staying in bed until the other had finished washing and dressing we felt that it was very overcharged for the size of room on checking out i told the receptionist how we felt and was horrified to see she was laughing i told her that i did not find it funny and if the guest was making a complaint the least she could do was acknowledge it disgusted i said i would not recommend or stay here again
