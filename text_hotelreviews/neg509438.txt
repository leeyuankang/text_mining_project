you must know that there are two hotels with the same name holiday inn kensington only blocks away from each other the cab drivers booking agents local people none of them will know which one you are going to you will have to get an exact address and keep it with you when you travel in addition the staff is large but this means some of them are less well trained than others we encountered rude staff at the pool and at breakfast
