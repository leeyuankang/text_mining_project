we were not made aware there was a deposit for each night we were staying completely unnecessary as the room was paid in advance by card and they had the details should any additional payment was required so no shopping money had to ask at checkout when deposit is refunded not for working days cleaner knocking at door every morning lights in room were wired to all turn on with each switch so no bedside lamp for reading as all lights came on repairs being done on floor meant we were expected to go down a flight of stairs and cross the hall back up the stairs to get to our room ridiculous
