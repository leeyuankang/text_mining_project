the room was small you could barely get to the window for the beds the bathroom was almost useless for a woman there were two tiny little lights right above the door but no light at all above the mirror which was crammed in the corner nowhere to put your products so putting on makeup in that bathroom was impossible i also don t know if a toilet brush is standard in english bathrooms or not but there was no brush which could make it pretty tricky at times for obvious reasons if you re travelling with a companion the little fridge in the closet smelled of mold but apart from that no complaints everything else was great
