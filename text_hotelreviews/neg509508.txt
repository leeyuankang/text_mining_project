personel was not so frendly not everyone but some of them yes i think many of the staff were new hires and they do not know too much food taste was neutral it has a variety of food but for me low quality this is based in my own experience and comparing with other simiar hotels sometimes i felt a kind ofr oughthnes in personel answers what i want to point here is even though the client may not be right it is still a client so there may not be place for discussion or make him feel unconfortable some personel were very friendly but maybe inexperienced in client treating thanks
