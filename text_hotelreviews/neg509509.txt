the customer service was really bad on arrival i was told i needed to pay an extra on top of my bill i had enough money for the stay and i was not aware of this extra costing this left me with for days in london which doesn t get you very far i also had travelled from ireland so i was left with very limited funds as a result i was then asked to pay again in on check out nearly a total of which would have been the equivalent of i refused to pay this as the money had already left my bank account and was charged to the hotel i was told that the first payment was in fact a pre authorization and i needed to pay the full amount again and the pre authorization would be released which can take days to come back into your bank account i refused to pay as i would have been left with no money to get back to the airport or pay bills rooms were small i booked a double bed and i was given single beds beds so small i fell out of bed times last night of stay i could hear everything in the room above me from going to the toilets and baths construction nearby and i was woken up before m i posted a review on tripadvisor and i was told that the double payment was protocol for debit cards untrue as i have booked hotels before in uk and i never had this experience i was told i should have been grateful that so much thought and security was put into my booking i was also told it was booking com s fault for the room i got and if i had booked directly and not through booking com the experience i went through would have been avoided i was also told i was always welcome at anytime back to the hotel i will never step foot in that hotel again and i would not recommend it i also felt the way in which i was dealt with was highly unprofessional and to blame booking com and to also have stated that if i booked with the hotel directly would have averted all this is untrue horrible experience and horrible customer service avoid
