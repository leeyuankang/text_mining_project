i booked this hotel for nights in a standard room upon arrival the room was very small for the price i asked if i could have an upgrade but the hotel advised they could only do this for a night i then tried to sleep after a hour flight and was constantly woken by the fire alarm then the following morning i was woken up by works being performed on the level above drilling hammering grinding heavy foot traffic etc i called reception they could barely hear me due to the noise they didn t apologise but said they could change the room i then changed rooms and there was still noise i called reception back and they said they would be up shortly and find another room i then called back minutes later i was advised that the person was on their way i then called back minutes later this time i was told there was no other rooms available so i had to endure more noise and didn t hear back from anyone then the same afternoon the fire alarm went off again on my last night the tv didn t work a maintenance person came to fix it unfortunately it couldn t be fixed i was advised a duty manager would call me and no one called in summary i didn t have a good nights sleep here i was unable to relax and there was no customer service i m extremely disappointed for a four star hour i would expect a lot more
