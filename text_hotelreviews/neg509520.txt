we had a problem with the booking when we checked in as it was under two separate bookings for nights after the second night stay they had checked us out without us knowing and our key no longer worked to get back to the room from being out all day on our last night we had to argue with reception who charged us again for nights stay even though we had already preauthorised nights which means my partner needs to wait upto days to get nearly back the staff weren t helpful on reception
