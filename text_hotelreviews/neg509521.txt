honestly the staff were not very nice and accommodating my husband is a platinum member of holiday inn and not that you should treat anyone different but you would have thought this was our first time every staying with holiday inn not once did they say thank you for choosing holiday inn all the time i have traveled with my husband many times and we stay at holiday inns because they treat us so well and are very accommodating not here by any means when we checked in the lady at the desk said we have you in a snug double and i said no we have a superior room and she then proceeded to argue with me for about minutes i asked her if she wanted to see my reservation and she agreed once i showed her my confirmation she then and only then happen to just find our reservation we then needed to check out a day early and told them at check in oh boy what a nightmare they were very rude to us since we booked with booking com they would not even look into the reservation overall i was not impressed with the hotel staff and it is a shame because the hotel was a beautiful hotel and perfect location
