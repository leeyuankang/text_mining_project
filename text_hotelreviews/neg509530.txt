restaurant food very poor selection and poor preparation of a selected choice and the fact that was added to everything including bar items the deposit we had to pay just in case we used room service or other extras was also a surprise i m still waiting for it to be repaid which could have been done on the day of departure sorry and sad to see such money making scams it cannot be justified
