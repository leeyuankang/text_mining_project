when i arrived i was asked for a deposit per night nights to be deducted for my card in case of damages to room etc no problem gave my card told i would like to pay full rate when checking out in cash discovered later the entire enough plus deposit do had been taken from my bank account this hadn t been explained to me i was told it was just the per night fine for me as i had travelled with cash but be aware if you haven t cash and wish to spend from bank account or have outgoing standing orders due that this money is not released back until after you check out and can take a few days only downside that didn t affect me really as i had cash but as i said be aware of it would have liked if this had been explained clearer
