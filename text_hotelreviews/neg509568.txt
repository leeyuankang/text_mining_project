the room was shockingly small for a twin bedded room i was meeting my friend there for a three day stay and i have more bruises on my legs because there was no room to get around the bottom of the bed to use facilities this is a single room with twin beds pushed in the bathroom was appauling you could not stretch over to turn on the water to fill the bath because it was such a tight squeeze pathetic toiletries on offer and the tv was crap no sky no decent programmes i use to stay here regular when it was the kensington close hotel with no complaints at all i will not be staying again
