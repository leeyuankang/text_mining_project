there was some loud building noise above my room where i thought they must be carrying out repairs refurbishments this was only on friday the day i arrived and stopped around i had no view as it was back of hotel but that was ok i thought the price was high for just a bed with breakfast as extra but i accepted that it was a late booking and didn t have much choice however everything was good
