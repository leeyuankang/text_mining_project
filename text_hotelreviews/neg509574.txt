bad hotel bad service they gave me a smaller room different than what i had reserved from booking i came twice to the room at night where there was no electricity no slippers or anything like that in the room and as i was sleeping in the room the housekeeping had entered the room without saying sorry she wanted to take the towels and the garbage even though i told her that i was sleeping she still asked when can i come i told her i don t know she even forgot the cleaning supplies in the room eventually they changed our room but overall it wasn t a pleasant experience
