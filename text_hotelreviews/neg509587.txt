our door was knocked at on the day of our departure which i was not happy about as we wanted to sleep longer minutes later after we had fallen asleep again the door was knocked again by the cleaners i phoned to reception to check what time check out was and was told the bar was a good size but way to expensive even for london classes of wine was and they had the cheek to charge a further service charge even though i bought it at the bar myself
