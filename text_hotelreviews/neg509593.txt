one of the lifts was not working so trying to get up to your room took longer than it should have and there where no signs to take the stairs anywhere also when we got into the room instead of one double bed like we had ordered we had single beds pushed together with single bed duvets and finally at in the morning one of the staff members tried to enter our room to which i dont know why it was lucky we had the catch on the door this was possibly a simple mistake but it was still rather embarrassing for me and my partner
