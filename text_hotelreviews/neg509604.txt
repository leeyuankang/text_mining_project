reception seemed grumpy and stressed on arrival it was not made at all clear prior to booking that there was a charge for the swimming pool per person for a four star hotel two teabags and two coffees in the room is poor and more tea selection would be expected breakfast staff were awful my partner fell ill with flu on the night of arrival and when i asked the restaurant staff if i could take him up a glass of juice and pastry she said i was not allowed and if he wanted to eat i would have to pay for room service my partner has recently had a liver transplant and this illness was stressful her attitude and lack of sympathy only added to my stress we ended up checking out early to rush my partner back to the home all in all not a great stay and i left feeling the hotel just wanted to make a extra profit wherever they could
