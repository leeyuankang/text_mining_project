minute queue at reception due to computer systems dying so i couldn t check in for a while room was absolutely tiny had to shuffle around the bed it was a good job my friend didn t come in the end also i didn t like the mandatory payment they took at reception from my card for incidental expenses i wasn t planning to spend any extra money during the one night s stay which if i did anyway i could have settled upon check out this wasn t any ordinary holding or just card authorisation because i was advised it would be refunded in days time i challenged it and was told if i didn t like it i could fill in a comments card booked this hotel because i wanted to use the pool but when i found out it was an extra i didn t use it really it should be included in the cost free for guests these issues have put me off staying here or with this hotel group again
