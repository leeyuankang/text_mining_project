i booked for two adults and two children and requested two twin rooms one of the rooms was a king size rather than a twin and the beds could not be separated to create two singles we arrived at the hotel on the saturday morning to leave our bags and were told check in would be we returned to the hotel at queued for a long time to check in to be told that one of the rooms was still dirty and we should return in ten minutes this meant going to the back of the queue when i got to reception again the room was still not ready and we were given vouchers to go and have a drink in the bar the room was finally ready when e returned at the staff were pleasant but this was a disappointing way to begin there was only a very small amount of milk provided in the room enough for one cup of tea then i had to go to concierge and request more there was no childrens tv on the tv in the room if you wanted kids programmes you had to pay extra to rent a children s movie
