booking com had sent over our booking but it had been noted as only room and we had to show our booking confirmation and banking to prove payment of the hotel resolved this although not before our friends arrival so did take an hour or so feel like they could of offered a complimentary breakfast as good will for the confusion and wasted time although obviously confusion between the booking agent and hotel whilst at the hotel they are responsible for our experience other than this the hotel is lovely and the staff were very helpful x
