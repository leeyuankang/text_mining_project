swimming pool too crowded looked like swimming lessons were taking place and sectioned off with lanes taking most of the pool then other adults were swimming lengths and we were told to move our children out of the way by an attendant we had to pay to go in the pool so it should be for guests not a business run pool just making money from lessons it never stated that in the read up our children were very restricted and didn t really have fun
