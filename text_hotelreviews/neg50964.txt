we needed an early breakfast for participation in the london marathon which had been a problem in previous years but despite reassurance that it would be available there was no provision however the restaurant staff rang through to the chef who had just arrived and quickly provided some porridge it had to go back initially but they did sort it out and then offered it as a complimentary service so fair play
