i made a special request for a room on a low floor for medical reasons and asked the person on reservations if this could be guaranteed to let me know in advance when i arrived the room was on the floor and after about an hour wait i eventually got one on the floor i asked to speak to the duty manager and he said i could move to first floor the next day but no apology for the inconvenience and made a few useless comments like when i said i met the housekeeper and asked if there was free rooms on the first floor and she yes this manager told me she would have no idea what rooms were available on any floor make sense no another point is the food the same menu is now used in restaurant bar and room service and it is a very limited menu and as a vegetarian i found it not cater at all and for the quality of the food it is not cheap i stayed there several times when it was just kensington close hotel and never had any complaints but now that it s owned by the group holiday inn i would have my doubts about booking there again which for me is a pity as i like the area very much and find it easy to see the sights etc from there a small point the tissue box had about tissues when we checked in which we used straight away the empty box was not replaced even though i took the box out of the silver container so housekeeping would know to replace but no stayed nights and this not replaced the standard rooms are quiet small and the bathrooms even smaller but having stayed previously we knew this and not a problem to finish holiday inn please note clients special requests and even though these cannot be quaranteed it would be good if they were at least read by reservations and make contact if needs be for me the fact this important request was overlooked ruined the leisure break i was looking for
