wasn t told that the use of the pool wouldn t be included in our stay and for a day for two people whom are residnents at the hotel is rather expensive staff weren t very informative of that either and the man i spoke to was rather rude also the room stated it would have a bath which it didn t and that was rather disappointing i guess my stay was average i ve certainly recieved better service and no complimentary gift alocohol was given on my birthday
