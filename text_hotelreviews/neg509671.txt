first the hotel tried to take payment almost a week prior to the check in date not an issue but a prior notice would have been nice then there is a security deposit of per room per night so almost were reserved on my account for no good reason some other hotels would reserve a small security deposit but never as much as per night the first rooms we got were still decorated in the kensington close hotel style and there was refurbishment going on literally in the rooms on the opposite side of the corridor the bathroom was tiny i m not the thinnest person around but certainly not the largest and i found it difficult to use the facilities in one of the two rooms the safe was not working half way though the stay we were asked to vacate the rooms and move to different ones on a different floor the new rooms were a bit better and decorated in the holiday inn style neither of the two new rooms had a dnd the shower was better but the shower door was poorly designed a piece of glass roughly half the size of the shower and as a result when taking the shower a lot of the water went on the floor combined with a poor ventilation the air in the room was pretty wet the beds in the new rooms were worse than the beds in the old rooms not terrible just worse finally the tv is located on the wall to the side of the bed making it difficult to watch comfortably overall it s not a terrible hotel but as much as i wanted to like it i just could not
