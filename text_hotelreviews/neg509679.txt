we chose this hotel due to the spa what we were not told was that it s a gym open to the public including children and on the day we hoped to use the pool it was being used for children s swimming lessons this meant that it was very noisy so couldn t use the facilities to relax but even if we could have both the steam room and jacuzzi were not in service there were also no appointment spaces for any treatments so essentially our plan for a spa day and the very reason for choosing his hotel was a complete waste of time
