charged to go in the spa even though they had swimming lessons in the pool i ve never been charged to use the pool at a hotel in my life it wasn t as if it was anything other than a basic pool sauna and steam room shower had mold in it and ceiling paint was very badly peeling and flaking off not a proper door on the bathroom plumbing was very noisy you could really hear toilets being flushed and water going down the drain was very strange
