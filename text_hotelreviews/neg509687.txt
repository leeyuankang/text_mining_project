was looking forward to using the pool but reception told me it was a day to use i was shocked and thought this was excessive amount to pay on top heating in the room not the best issues with it fire alarm went off near midnight alarm constant but no staff checking to see if we all evacuated only looking out window to see crowds congregating did we make it down and no official word just when everyone else starting going back in we did no explanation and no apology wifi codes change every few days but they didn t tell us this very frustrating
