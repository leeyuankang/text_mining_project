i have stayed at this hotel a few times when it was the kensington hotel and spa and i loved it that s why i returned the holiday inn has taken it over and it has gone down hill dramatically in the service and staff area we were greeted at the front door on arrival by a very grumpy man instead of the jolly londoner that was there previously the staff were cold and quite difficult to speak to at times except the gentleman who processed our check out he was friendly on the whole the staff were miserable and very cold not like the welcoming smiling faces you expect in a hotel there were at least different people having problems that we saw during our stay and the manager was very rude to one lady i was shocked in the decline of staff and service i will not return here but spend my hard earned money elsewhere
