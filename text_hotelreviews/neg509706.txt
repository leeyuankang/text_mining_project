requested a refund for the pounds paid for dinner menu very poor but the manager was very reluctant for this to happen so phoned bookings com then she gave me the refund on you answering we then had to go out of the hotel to find dinner asked concierge times for green tea times normal tea arrived in the room on the time concierge person who spoke good english said oh we don t do green tea i can not believe this to be the case in a star hotel we were awoken at with room service knock even though we did not request it we were asked to pay an additional pounds to use the pool this was not asked in the initial booking we did not go in as there were children s swimming lessons taking place and therefore not a relaxing place to sit
