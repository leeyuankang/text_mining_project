we booked a twin bed room online weeks before and agreed this with the receptionist our room keys didn t unlock the door so we had to go for help when we eventually got into the room it was a double bed we had to use a mobile phone to call the reception to query the bed as the phone in the room did not work no one called us back although we gave the mobile number so we had to call again to be told someone was on their way after minutes of waiting someone came to give us keys for another room which did have twin beds but was not as nicely appointed or as clean as the double room a poor start to our otherwise good stay in the hotel
