sent email twice before my arrival asking to arrange rooms as close to each other as possible rooms were accommodated miles away on the same floor though repair works every morning starting at above our standard twin room level with unbearable noise but since we were out whole day from to i did not ask to change it overall quality of standard twin was way below it felt like you were in different hotel paying extra for health facilities was inconvenient
