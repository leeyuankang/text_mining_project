furniture in room a little tatty door man was a snob verging on rude i had phoned ahead and booked a parking place in the hotels car park on arrival i approached the doorman as instructed he took one look our car it was clearly not up to his usual standard and said in a very condescending manner you do realise that you have to pay for parking then told me to wait we needed him to show us where to go to park whilst he dealt with someone else who arrived after us we were ignored by him for a good few minutes i m sure if we looked wealthier we would not have been treated in this way
