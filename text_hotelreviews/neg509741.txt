i had to leave the first room at midnight as the bath was filling up with filthy water coming up the plug hole i was moved to another room which was next to the cleaners cupboard so was woken by them at after a very unsettled night i asked to be moved to a less noisy rm which they did but in the process of moving an expensive top of mine was lost they are suppose to be replacing it but guess what i have heard nothing from them the hotels has recently changed hands and there are builders everywhere my advice would be stay somewhere else
