the bathroom was awkward small and very narrow i cannot imagine a tall person never mind a wide one being able to stay in this room comfort was really sacrificed to save space and it was difficult to brush my teeth as the tiny sink yes tiny was directly under a cabinet and it was nigh impossible to get to the sink at all without cracking forehead or head friends in another room had to change rooms because it was too small for two people but their bathroom sink was all right the rooms are quite different from each other as the hotel is growing and several buildings are involved in the refurbishment
