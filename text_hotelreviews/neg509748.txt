the service after the visit was shocking money was taken out of my account without my permission after checkout i do not expect a hotel to keep my details after checkout they continued to take money out resulting in me having to contact the bank to get my money refunded staff were rude and incompetent they did not understand the problem they passed me to many different people and none of them knew what to do i rang to make a formal complaint and was told i d get a call back but didn t i sent a formal complaint by email times and did not even receive an acknowledgement of my email very disappointing it ruined a good stay there and for that reason i would not recommend or return
