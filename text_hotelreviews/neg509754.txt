the room above me was a building site we woke up every morning to loud banging and drilling both times we went to complain no managers are available at the moment i can offer you some free drinks the trip to london was great but let down by the hotel experience we were not notified the hotel would be changing hands to the holiday inn and we re not expecting to have to put up with the noise on a relaxing long weekend away
