we booked an executive club room and was given a standard they said nothing we could do as no other rooms available my sister went back up to her correct executive room and someone else had checked into it although she had already done so and her belongings were in the room the couple said they thought this was odd as a porter took the stuff to lost property the duty manager just said sorry but he couldn t do anything cannot believe we paid executive prices when we stayed in a room so small you would struggle to get around with your belongings out
