the rooms and bathroom are smaller then they look on the pics but they are clean and littery is very good the check in out staff was a bit lost in their new system the hotel became a holiday inn the week before our arrival couldn t find the reservation they asked for my credit card upon arrival but promised me they wouldn t charge it but when i came to check out and pay they had already charged my credit card not very happy
