everything i will be making a huge complaint to holiday inn the day we checked in was the day the kensington close hotel was changing hands to the holiday inn the computer system was flawed no ones key cards worked the queues were horrendous the rooms werent ready the rooms were not allocated as per booking the bed size was wrong it completely spoilt my one and only weekend away this year and i paid over a hundred pounds a night for a poxy holiday inn if i wanted a holiday inn i would have booked a holiday inn shame on you booking com for not informing people of a really important event this really was a case of robbing people lots of shouting and lots of disgruntled people all weekend the poor staff were so fed up but tried their best
