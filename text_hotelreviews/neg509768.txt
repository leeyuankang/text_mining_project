the staff were rude i wasn t informed of the change of name of hotel so walked about looking for this i never got the room i asked for and never got into my room until after waiting over hours after midnight which meant i lost out on my friday night there was no handover with the staff and time wasted again in the morn eventually i was offered off the sat night room rate i don t think this was acceptable i wasn t prepared to waste anymore time and advised a complaint would be going into both booking com and holiday inn it s a shame as i have always praised holiday inn and staff the location was great the staff especially the senior or duty managers were not interested helpful or understanding would not recommend this hotel
