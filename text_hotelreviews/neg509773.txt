room was very small being on the floor i was on the same floor that was halfway renovated so always had to use the furthest away elevator and the corridor was somewhat dusty furniture and fittings in room in poor condition door on cupboard on single hinge and work desk in need of renovation or replacement wifi in room didn t work although apparently you could get a voucher instead of logging in online bed jammed up against far wall from door so if you were a couple in the bed one would have to climb over the other to get to the bathroom however may be holiday inn has taken over this place to bring it up to standard so i m not condemning this hotel they may just need time to get everything sorted
