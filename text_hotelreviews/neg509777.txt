i did not like it because the rooms do not have the standards of stars hotels i was not happy to pay extra for each night i have stayed in the staff had informed me that i have to pay like deposit in case i destroy any object in that room then what for is the insurance i could spent this money to enjoy my trip the room i have seen online is totally different from the one i had internet extremely slow and no tv programs only the publicity ones old and broken furniture i really wanted to show my daughter christmas lights in london and i have made an effort for this trip but unfortunately the hotel i had booked was really really bad and did affect my mini holidays i have been before in other stars hotels and there is no point of comparison how lovely they were we actually thought kingston will be a lot better as the pictures online look great but is a all false hope this feedback will help to improve services and being honest to people will bring you a lot more clients
