check in was a mess they didnt know if the rooms were ready given the wrong rooms booked and paid for doubles given singles and it took us mins to check in one guest had house keeping come into the room when they were in the shower at for no reason we all got woken up by house keeping at trying to clean the room when check out is at staff were quite rude breakfast was a joke they didnt know what they were doing check out again was the same mins to check out some were nearly charged twice i wouldnt recommend this hotel we heard so many people complaining we had rooms booked and none of my guests were impressed
