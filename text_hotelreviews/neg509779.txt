well hotel had been rebranded on the day we arrived so checkin was a nightmare with long queues we were eventually given a teeny tiny double room we requested a twin with no explanation or apology from the rather frazzled and not very helpful man at reception we did not accept this and had to wait another half an hour for a suitable twin room to be found manager was very apologetic and offered us free breakfast to compensate wifi is a disaster it works very slowly about of the times you need it
