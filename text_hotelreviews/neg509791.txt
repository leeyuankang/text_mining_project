check in was hours late and not even a complimentary drink at the bar was offered the room was tiny i think we must have had the smallest room on the property the lifts are inadequate for the numbers of guests frequently had to use the stairs so thankfully we were on the first floor there is no extractor fan in the bathroom so the mirrors steam up the bar prices are extortionate as well
