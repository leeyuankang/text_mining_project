deposit for one night i thought was excessive what frustrated me more was this was taken from my account and not paid back until days later i was not informed about this before my stay i booked this hotel as a surprise for my girlfriend with intention of using the swimming pool however there is extra charge per person to use the facilities i thought was ridiculous considering this was not informed to me before booking or at check in overall a very disappointing stay
