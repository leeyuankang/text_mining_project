executive club room we stayed in was very small and cramped for the money i expected more every time we wanted to use the heating we had to ring reception to have the thermostat activated the in room iron leaked water into the cord causing the power to trip out and leaving the room in darkness causing distress to my partner as she was in the shower at the time when reception was called they sent a maintenance man who had no idea where the fuse box was he left for minutes again leaving us in darkness in the mean time i found the fuse box and reset the power which immediately tripped out again until i realised the iron was causing the problem the iron had no safety certification saying when it was last inspected lucky i didn t receive an electric shock the hotel staff showed no interest in this matter and strangely there was no member of management available for me to discuss this with the bar staff tried charging a service charge for carrying drinks less than ft seemed a little bemused when i told them to remove the charge from the bill all in all a nice hotel run by poor quality staff
