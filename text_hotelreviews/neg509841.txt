we requested a cot for our daughter we arrived to find a broken cot with no bed linings previously on this trip we had stayed in different premier inns lower quality and the cots etc were excellent this was rectified after speaking to the reception after we found another cot with a lovely duvet our daughter was very happy there was construction work being carried out on random rooms on the floor really noisy during the day banging drilling the fire alarm went off at and we had to vacate premises with my month old then re enter without a proper fire drill no hotel staff were around very unprofessional the people behind the reception were ok but one receptionist was very cold and never smiled even with the cot incident no wifi acess
