they put us in a room with construction site next door this began at everyday which means you don t get sleep in a hotel which seems the opposite of what it s needed for when you tried to tell staff they looked at you as if it was your fault they then moved us to a room where the tv wasn t viewable and essentially in a cupboard the hotel is only on one obscure tube line no access and awful location in terms of speed staff were tragic all the way through especially at management level to top it all off on the last day they had a fire alarm failure at which caused the whole hotel evacuate did anyone apologise of course not worst hotel i ve ever stayed in and it s not exactly a no frills hotel don t waste your money stay elsewhere
