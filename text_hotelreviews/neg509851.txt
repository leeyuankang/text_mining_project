i usually stay next door at the copthorne tara but it has become pricier recently my last visit here was good and compared very favourably with its neighbour this time not so the room was small and the bathroom very small and cramped the wifi connection didn t work but since it was included in the room rate the receptionist was unable to give me a refund parking from noon one day to four the next cost an addition probably standard for london but still expensive the room smelled of air freshener and cigarette smoke
