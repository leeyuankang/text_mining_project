the bar is a bit pricey but i guess that s what you get in a london hotel the room was smaller than i expected but we only slept in it so we didn t need more the hotel s water system was a bit active but apart from a rather odd gurgle in the middle of the night which made me jump was otherwise what you d expect in an hotel of this size age
