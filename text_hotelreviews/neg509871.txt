had to pay for wifi even though we twice tried to sort this by telling staff this was meant to be included beautiful pictures on the website showing nice spacious suites we paid almost for nights the room was so so small a vanity shelf was put right at the end of the bed leabing about between the end of the bed on the shelf squeezing around the bed resulted in nasty and painful bruises to the thighs if you caught the shelf paint was smeared across the tiles where they had decorated and a stanley knife blade was found in the bottom of the shower the view was of a waterlogged rooftop cigarette butts and the dumpsters at the back of the hotel piled with rubbish the tube station was around away which was handy holland park and hyde park are close i would not recommend this hotel as a couple we felt a little duped they showed rooms that were clearly not offered for the price we paid they should have showed us what our money was getting if so we would have not booked this place it is very expensive small cramped and painful on the thighs trying to work your way around an ill designed shoe box room
