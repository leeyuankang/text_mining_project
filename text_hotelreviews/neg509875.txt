despite being on the menu there was no hash browns for breakfast although this was substituted by normal potatoes which was acceptable unfortunately all of the breakfast was stone cold the wifi connection was fiddly and constantly kept dropping out there was building work in the hotel and what seemed like a constant heavy drilling for most of the day time which was annoying the double bed was two mattresses pushed together which gave an uncomfortable ridge in the centre of the bed
