the room was a delux double and was very poky and small the window was tiny and positioned in the far corner of the room as such you have to have the lights on all the time there was only one seat in the room so had there been of us we would have had to of sat on the bed however the room was very clean the breakfast was not very good the choice was limited especially where fruit and yogurt were concerned the eggs were tasteless as was the rest of the cooked food disappointing
