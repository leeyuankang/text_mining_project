i requested early check in when i arrived at the hotel the woman at the front desk was less than helpful and said our room was not ready and would not be ready for a few hours so come back then when we returned hours later the room was still not ready so we waited in the lobby while other people checked in early with no problems i approached another person at the desk and told them the situation and they found us a room immediately and were very kind and helpful the other woman was less than kind and had terrible customer service this was the only problem throughout the stay around on sunday night the fire alarm went off turned out to be a false alarm but that didn t bother me i appreciate customer service and my experience at check in was less than positive
