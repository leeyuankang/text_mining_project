rooms were too small paid for the bigger room as i had seen the review on trip advisor about the room size inspite of me paying extra i was still placed in a smaller room when i complained i was moved to a slightly bigger room with little or no wifi connection the room had no wifi connection at all and having a service was also hard overall i would say this hotel is overrated for price
