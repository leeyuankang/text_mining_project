the room was tiny it was a massive disappointment and we feel we were misled we tried to get a refund but as we booked thru booking com and paid upfront we weren t able we had a bed in a single room bed was pushed up against the wall against the window so one person had to shuffle down the bed to get out the en suite was so tiny that i couldn t stand in the space made for the toilet as the gap wasn t as wide as my shoulders the advert was for a standard room which we certainly didn t get we want our money back
