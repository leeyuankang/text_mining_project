i found my window open when i returned to my room after a day of touring i called front desk and also spoke with housekeeping to complain i was highly concerned for the safety security of items in my room suitcase and belongings the response i received is that it must have been left open during the cleaning and i should not worry i was worried that my security had been breached especially since my room on the fifth floor was looking out on a roof top i was not pleased that they did not pursue my complaint and confirm with the particular cleaner that she had left it open and notify me of their findings so that i could rest easier knowing that someone did not break into my room although sufficient for my needs the room was small two single beds and bathroom was a tight fit it didn t resemble the large comfortable rooms on the web sit
