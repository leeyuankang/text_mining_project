went down to london for a night on our honeymoon let the hotel know this said they have us in a nice room they put is in a coat closet with terrible out dated feel nothing like the pics they advertise and they did nothing for our special occasion even wifi was a charge maybe i m just used to the hospitality one receives in the states but you could at least wave the charge for wifi overcharged
