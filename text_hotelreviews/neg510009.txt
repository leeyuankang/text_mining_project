bed was hard and pillows were hard for my liking the room was quite small the spa was not worth pp and they did not offer us robes when we told them they were not in the room people were jumping in the pool with clothes on such as shorts and t shirt when they should have been wearing swimming costumes they were leaving the steam room door open which set off the alarms yet nothing was said to them by the pool attendants no room in the small spa only allowed at one time so had to wait for a turn only beds which were occupied most of the time very disappointing that the hotel is named after the spa so was expecting good things
