we were told that we used the spa which we did not the staff told us afterwards that only your room number is needed to use the facilities at the spa that means that anyone can give any room number to use the spa i honestly think that the hotel should find a better way for example using the room card to enter the spa we were put in an uncomfortable situation to justify something that we were not to blame for
