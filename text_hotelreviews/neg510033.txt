shower water pressure was very low the hairdryer was rubbish would definitely advise people to take their own service charge on everything the spa pool area could do with a bit of tlc sadly the jacuzzi was not working which is a shame especially when you pay extra to use the facilities the sauna had a very sharp and dangerous brake on the bench so i did not use this either
