the bed linen was dirty with fresh marks and blood stains a dirty microfibre cleaning towel was left in the bath it was obvious that the room had a very cursory clean and the bed clothes weren t even changed from one guest to the next very disappointed considering the price of accommodation however i have stayed here a few times before and this is the first negative impression i have had of the place
