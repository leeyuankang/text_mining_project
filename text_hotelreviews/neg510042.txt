i did not like the superior room that i was located the room itself was fine the toilet was small and there was no rooms for moving around the sink was the smallest i have seen in my life and wrongly orientated it was very inconvenient to use the sink for washing and shaving and with the size of the toilet it was dangerous to get in and use the bath i had to change the room and select a better room so i can enjoy my stay at the hotel after i changed the room to an executive room paying the different in price everything was fine afterwards
