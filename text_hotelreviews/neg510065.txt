on arriving i was given a swipe card that didn t work so had to trail back down to reception with all my luggage so they could amend this my partner had arrived really early after travelling by night bus despite phoning to notify them of this the previous night she had to wait a couple of hours then ask to get a room despite these inconveniences they still wanted an extra per hour if we wanted to check out late there was no iron board in the room which we had to ask for which i thought odd considering it s hardly a luxury something that most places provide the walls are paper thin so you can hear more than you would like and we had housekeeping chap on our door at to ask if we needed our room serviced luckily we were up but i don t imagine many people would be at that time just lots of stupid little things that if hadn t have happened would have gave me a lot better impression of the hotel s overall service was otherwise fine for the short time we were there
