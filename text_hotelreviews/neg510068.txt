lovely hotel but has some flaws when paying a night for two i really don t think it s acceptable to charge to use the gym per day that s ridiculous i stay here once or twice a week price ranges from or two at if i were to use gym eat breakfast and pay for wifi i d have to add another per day to my bill this is a real shame as i actually like this hotel and staff are absolutely lovely never in the months that i ve used this hotel have they been anything but polite and professional lovely in fact now i m not asking for free food of course but i should be able to pay for a day gym pass asking is a ripoff sorry and for wifi for two days come off it saying this the last two visits i ve been given free wifi happy emma maybe you ve realised that s unacceptable who knows
