the extra prices to use things like wi fi for hours and the service was pretty slow and absolutely not worth it and the pool were a bit ridiculous considering we d already paid to stay there you d think they would be included also i had to pay a deposit for every night we stayed there overall which was not explained anywhere online to me and i was just surprised with that huge extra cost at check in i m apparently to receive the deposit money back within the next week after check out but had i known this was required i wouldn t have booked to stay here
