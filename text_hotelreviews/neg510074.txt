our room was very small modern we were happy on arrival however the mattress on the bed was awful it honestly needs to be binned you were practically lying on the springs also if i needed the toilet during the night i would have to have climbed over the top of my husband as the bed was hard up against the wall we did complain in the morning we got to speak to the front of house manager who was really lovely very understanding we were given an upgrade for free which was very much appreciated
