there was no free internet and the hours access failed a couple of times when using the mobile booking when reporting this the staff was kind enough to give me a free voucher but free internet nowadays i think is a must for a star hotel the spa did not impress me at all i think is better to go for a massage somewhere outside the hotel the prices are high and the service is not that good
