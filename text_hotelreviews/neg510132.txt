absolutely awful i had booked a room for one night for me and my partner as a birthday present on arrival straight away they advised i would have to pay an extra just in case i used other facilities thinking i would receive the money back into my account when i checked out i agreed and carried on with checking in overall the hotel looked lovely until we got into our room it was so cramped and tiny considering i paid for an exclusive double room i felt abit robbed not to mention the view of a horrible roof we then proceeded to try the wifi to them find out it was a day wow in this day and ages this is ridiculous i could understand or something similar later into the night all we heard was slamming doors and construction outside walls almost like paper but i must say the worst part of all was not requesting a wake up call and leaving a do not disturb sign outside somebody just walks into our room at half in the morning looking in and walking back out furious isn t even the word and to top it off the money they took from me will not be back into my account until working days talk about false advertisement and awful service i seriously would never recommend anyone to stay here
