very expensive breakfast not included in price per day for wifi was ridiculous per visit to the gym was also ridiculous you could not swing a cat in the room it felt like we were charged surpluses the whole duration of the stay which was unnecessary i travel a lot and i have never been asked to pay for wifi and entry to a gym even the girl on reception was embarrassed to tell us the price
