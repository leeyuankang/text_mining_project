my room smelt very smoky the pounds a day for wifi is ridiculous luckily as a booking com genius you get free wifi just as well because the quality is anyway not great the staff policy is a bit odd they can be overly helpful but you get the feeling it is all for a tip and if you don t give one immediately you are ignored
