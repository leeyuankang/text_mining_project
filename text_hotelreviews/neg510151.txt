room poor and basic the bed was dreadful when sat on it knew immediately that we wouldn t get good night sleep especially after travelling all day and tea facilities had no biscuits i was starving on arrival and needed refreshment after our journey might seem petty but is this a cut back or staff nicking the biscuits we arrived late in the day and the reason we chose hotel was to use pool and gym too but that was extra charge which wasnt case few yrs ago when came there spoke to reception with language difficulty and then they spoke to manager eventually got another regular standard room which they tried to get me to pay extra for it just goes to show its not what it seems on glam advertising and photos beware and if you havent stayed there before then you have lost your money no refund i ve stayed in many hotels and know what to expect a good bed no cigarette smoke smelling room decent kettle and biscuits decent bathroom decent size tv clean fresh smelling room these are the standards expected in a hotel stay yes pay extra if you want all the frills but this should not have been the case to waste our time trying to explain to reception staff then waiting for call back from the manager then being shown another room which was further away then eventually went out to eat but restaurants were shut by then managed to get one drink before pub shut really know your hotel before you stay there and dont be fobbed off for basic room with poor standards and be expected to may more for a standard room i would love to be a hotel inspector first impression on outside nice with a doorman but once inside room uh dont be fooled
