the bathroom had a ridiculous layout with the toilet squashed into a small narrow corridor like space the washbasin was tiny so any attempt to wash resulted in wet feet and floor cleaning teeth was made very difficult because of the combination of the small basin and the cabinet which was just above it whoever designed the layout seem to have thought more about how it would look than the practicalities of using it the bathroom would put me off staying for more than one night in the hotel
