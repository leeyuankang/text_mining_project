i know it is london but what characterizes this hotel more than anything is it s greed the rooms are very small for what you pay but more alarming is the long list of extra charges day for breakfast day parking day if you wish to use the leisure facilities but the real joke is that is this digital age we live london hotels still expect to charge to use the internet day i travel regularly for work can not remember the last time i had to pay for internet access in the room
