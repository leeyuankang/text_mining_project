i have never ever seen a m or was it bed for two in a hotell the rooms we had three were not as nice as the pictures and both room and bathroom were very small for that price sek per night i expected more the booking we had made including breakfast had not gone through and the staff first asked for the breakfast cost again after showing confirmation they first had to check with booking com this took time and was annoying
