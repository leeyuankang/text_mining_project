this hotel reminded me of being on a cruise ship you pay for the smallest room and everything else is extra it took about minutes to check in including a long queue then they said they had upgraded us from a double to an executive double what a joke if you saw the room it was so small couldn t even open a suitcase they charged a day for internet per device what an absolute joke we were lucky to get it free from booking com the spa facilities pool jacuzzi are also not included an additional per person a day for that then breakfast was an additional per day per person they didn t even include lattes or omelettes that s extra basically you pay an okay price for the room end up leaving with a few hundred pounds in expenses
