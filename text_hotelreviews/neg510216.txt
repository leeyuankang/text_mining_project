no bath in the room which was an issue when there doing the marathon and would have liked to have had a bath when i got back you have to pay to use the wifi which i think is bad when you have payed so much to stay in a hotel have to pay extra to use the leisure facilities which i think is disgusting again when you have premium prices for a hotel these points would stop us using this hotel again
