staff were not very helpful the reception and lobby are nice and new and then you get to the bedroom which is the size of a shoe box and not maintained breakfast and drinks in the bar are way over priced lovely cafes just up the street serving great breakfast for half the price the bar also put on your bill a discretionary charge of for poor service only reason we stayed was for a wedding near by would be very disappointed if i had been here for a weekend away to relax
