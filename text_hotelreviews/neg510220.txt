the lovely reception and welcoming porters is where it ends boulevard restuarant evening dining decided to eat here because the menu looked lovely and the menus in the lifts had two courses for however the menu they gave us when we arrived wasn t the one advertised we were told that one had finished the week before how convenient instead of apologising and offering to honour the advertised menu or at least offer a bottle of wine or some other compromise we were asked which lifts we d seen the menus in and told that they had been removed the week before in the meantime someone went and removed them and replaced them with the new ones they then messed up the wine order and charged instead of because they brought a different wine to the one ordered and then stuck service charge on each of our bills the food was average not worth the price if they had apologised and admitted a mistake and offered some sort of compromise it would have gone a long way i will also add that when we got in the lift today and lifted the menu up to see if the other one was still underneath two other ladies in the lift laughed and said they had just done the same thing because they had the same experience as us rooms in need of a serious refurb boring tired decor shower not working and replaced with pathetic hose stuck half way up the wall which you had to take off to wash your hair and i am only inches tall nothing like the pictures
