we were supposed to have a deal with the workshop i attended for a cup of soup and a sandwich which was a bit overpriced but considering it would be a quick option on the hour break we had i was happy to pay however we waited around minutes and there was no sign of the food so i cancelled my order as i didn t want to be late for the next course we were a table of people but only meals arrived the staff seemed quite lost even though the restaurant was almost empty the little bar in the entrance closed at pm after that a single espresso costed me if i remember correctly having to pay for wifi
