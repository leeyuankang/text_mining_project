bedroom was very small bathroom door couldn t open fully as it hit the bath and our bed was up against every wall which meant climbing over the bed to each side for the cost it fell way below expectations having stayed in london several times this was not what i was expecting for the price possibly the worst value for money out of any hotel i ve ever stayed in
