my opinion is that a hotel claiming to be and charging the prices it does we paid over for three nights b b should offer more the lobby consists of an extremely small area in which there are only two chairs for guests to use there is nowhere to sit and relax out of the bedroom the bar which closes at is extremely limited and doubles as the breakfast room our executive double room was supposed to have a separate seating area which was not the case and had only one comfortable seat not ideal in a double room i reported a faulty lamp in the room which was not fixed the breakfast was acceptable despite being let down by for example cheap and bitter orange juice poured into the dispenser from a carton coffee was served in cafetieres that need replacing and which were plunged by staff as soon as the water was put in for the price we paid we could have stayed in a much better hotel with better facilities whilst it was ok our stay was disappointing in many respects
