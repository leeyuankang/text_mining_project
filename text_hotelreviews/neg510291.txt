what didn t i like the extra cost of wifi and the obscene car parking charges in most hotels i visit wifi is free to access i was surprised when it wasn t in such a modern setting our room was clean but it had an overwhelming damp foisty smell the cleaners clearly tried to get rid of it because each day they left our room window wide open so when we returned it was freezing thus our room was cold and smelly
