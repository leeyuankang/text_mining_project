i initially checked into a single room which felt like a prison cell it was so small paying extra for a double room was worth it i was not impressed to be charged extra to use the pool and gym in the hotel it should be included as it would be in any other hotel when i complained to the gentleman on reception at check out he was unable to give me any explanation or apology just shrugged his shoulders not very helpful i also couldn t see anywhere on the website where it notifies the client that they will have to pay an extra charge to use hotel facilities
