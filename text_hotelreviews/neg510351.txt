room was very small which is ok but a few problems made it not a very good experience the power shower was great but it basically spreads water all over the bathroom since it doesn t have proper protection the bed is a double and the mattress was awful we could feel the springs also a lot of noise came from the ac vents even when the ac was off it seemed like some plumbing noises
