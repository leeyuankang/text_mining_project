room decor quite tired but it looked like they are refurbing the hotel in places so may just be the luck of what room you get when you arrive or maybe what rate you paid i got a good rate room was not very big no fridge sliding door to wc has an inch wide gap down the side making it not very private you can watch someone on the toilet if you want tv was awkward to use no epg and remote control had loads of redundant buttons because of their bespoke system no free wifi service but got service on network bed was twin beds joined together not unusual i know but had a massive valley in the middle so if you were not on your own side you felt like you were falling in the hole hard to find by car on first arrival because they don t have a description of the hotel position on the website and just use a generic google map by the way it s next to the copthorne tara hotel and actually more on scarsdale place than wrights lane it is on the bend at the end of wrights lane where it becomes cheniston gardens
