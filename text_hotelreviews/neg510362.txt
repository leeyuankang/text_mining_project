no minibar but i don t use it so it wasn t a problem would have liked a complementary bottle of water though the plug hole in the bath was not working correctly it wasn t draining so i had to remove the plug cover for it to drain the bathroom didn t have much room for storage no countertop so i had to keep toiletries on the bedroom desk no electricity point near the bed for charging phones etc but i kept my phone on the desk the room wasn t big but ok for a single room all in all no big problems and i had a comfortable stay would always come back here for my london visits
