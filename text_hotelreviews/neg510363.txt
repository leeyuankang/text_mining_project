after paying an expensive amount for the room this was excluding breakfast at per day and the use of the facilities at pp per day the double bed is two single beds combined into one with a bed sheet over both bed with a zip running down the middle very very uncomfortable the room is small for an executive room i am very disappointed and for a student this was too much over my budget and not worth the cost
