i had a single room and it was horrible cold very basic no mini bar the bathroom fan would run for minutes after the light went out the bed was tiny the safe wouldn t take my laptop which has never happened elsewhere they charge for wifi but it was so bad i couldn t work their response was i should have come down to use it in the lobby they didn t charge me in the end the difference in price for a double room was only and i wished i taken one hopefully they re better ok for the price but the room really let the hotel down
