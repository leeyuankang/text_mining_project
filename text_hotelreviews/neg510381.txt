you have to pay to use the swimming pool even though you are a guest at the hotel wi fi is very expensive and is for device only as we were people husband wife and little boy and staying for nights wifi would have ended up a fortune for smart phones and tablet i bought a voucher on the first day but one gentle staff at the reception gave me free wifi vouchers from the second day of our stay so i didn t have to pay for the rest of the days and that was very nice of him the ac heater doesn t work unless you call them and they ask you to wait for about half an hour to fix it as we stayed in january we had to make the call every time we came back to the room
