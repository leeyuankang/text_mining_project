the reception desk need to greet people with more enthusiasm they all seemed as though they wished that they weren t there not one smiled once also had to wait minutes for our soup in the lounge bar we had to cancel the order as we were going to a show and had to leave without any lunch thought it would have been nice if the waiter serving our table in the evening had made a comment when we told him it was our golden wedding anniversary the reason for a visit to london also at breakfast it would be good to be asked if we would like more tea or coffee as has happens in all of the previous hotels we have stayed in i asked for a clean knife to spread the butter on my knife and waited for about minutes but the waiter did not return my husband stayed in the hotel several times in the s and s but he was very disappointed with this visit we didn t use the spa etc as we felt we shouldn t have to pay to use the pool if we are guests in the hotel
