only complaint was the room had a gap of about between the bottom of the bed and wall to get round to other side of room room is very small and the way they have crammed in the facilities was poor small fridge just lying on floor and not making good use of wall space in my opinion looked very amateurish and have had better rooms in a premier inn dissapointing after walking into such a noce hotel lobby
