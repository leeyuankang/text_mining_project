the staff were horrible aside from the gentlemen at the front that greet you when you walk in no one was helpful none of them speak english and never understood me when i asked them a question i had to ask three separate people before anyone could show me how to turn on the lights this made things very difficult when it came to figuring out parking ordering service to the room etc i would never stay there again just because the staff is so horrible the staff can either make or break a place and they really ruined this experience for me
