breakfast was really below standard we arrived with half an hour to spare yet it looked like it was all finished no bacon sausage or mushrooms what was available was cold table only half laid up continental breakfast looked really uninteresting poor selection of fresh fruit melon and a couple of granny smiths not good enough for the quality of this hotel went without and didn t even waste our time on the second morning of our stay in addition we had an executive club room which certainly does not live up to its grand name shower over bath and no grab rails even with a slip mat quite hazardous
