i feel this hotel is very over priced you do not pay for the hotel here you pay for the location i had the executive double room i was told it was the biggest available but it was definitely so small i was shocked that it could be called an executive room if that is executive i feel terribly sorry for the people who paid for a standard room it must have been like a box
