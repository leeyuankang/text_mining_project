the night staff was terrible we had a room rate that didn t include internet so we paid per night per device for internet needless to say when it didn t work i was a little upset is almost when we complained to the night staff we were told it was our devices well we tried that for a few nights i was extremely angry so when we checked out i asked for a refund which after some arm twisting was granted that said i think it is absolutely ridiculous that we had to pay for internet at all especially when it wasn t even good service
