this is the second time we have stayed at the hotel the first time was amazing this time it was not so the room was very small the toilet was crammed into the smallest place possible if you have wide shoulder you are in trouble the wardrobe door couldn t be opened fully due to the closing bracket on the room door toilet rolls had to be asked for as did sugar and milk as not replaced all in all very disappointing following an amazing first stay at the hotel i had thought i would never need to look for another hotel in london however after this latest stay i will be shopping around for our next weekend away
