initially we were given a room designed for wheelchair access meaning the bathroom facilities were not right for us we mentioned this to reception and they kindly moved our luggage to another room whilst we left for the theatre this would ve been fine except we were given one with twin beds as opposed to the double bed we had booked and as we didn t get back until very late we decided not to mention this to reception it was a shame but other than that it was a very nice hotel breakfast was great too
