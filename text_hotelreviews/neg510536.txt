the room was appalling freezing cold and we couldn t get the heater to work adequately thin pillows tiny tiny sink with huge tap led to water splashing on the floor and an inability to wash one s face very small bath that you couldn t lie down in and i m only the deafening extractor fan stayed on for an hour after only being in the bathroom for a few minutes very expensive wi fi without any free time at all breakfast was chaos we took one look and went elsewhere we ordered a newspaper which didn t arrive and staff weren t too bothered when we told them it hadn t arrived this was repeated the next day despite checking our order they did move us to another room which was warmer but the sink extractor fan and bath of course were the same
