i asked for a room with a bath and was given a room with a shower miles from the lift and being disabled found this quite far they did move us when we complained to a room with more problems the bathroom door was so hard to shut i am disabled but my husband also had great problem sliding it shut as it was rubbing on the outers later that night when i came to have a bath the water just ran away as the plug was broken so no long soak at the end of a hard day we met our business associate in the restaurant for coffee he had to go to out to another meeting so he told the staff to put our food on his bill as he was staying there too this didn t happen we ended up paying for it the food which was very disappointing the veg was so raw i could not eat it the food was barely warm and the meat was tough the breakfast wasn t warm either maybe the bain marie s hadn t been turned up the bed was the smallest double i have seen it didn t fit the base so i kept catching my leg on this also the bottom sheet was too small to tuck in and upon waking noticed the mattress was stained i must say this is the worse hotel experience i have had
