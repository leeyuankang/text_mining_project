the staff were thin on the grounds in the bar area and unfortunately we were left waiting long periods with no drinks the public areas were really well presented clean open and of high quality but beyond the public areas the rooms were disappointing the room was really small and literally only large enough for the bed the room had very poor lighting so it was dark and the ensuite was clearly an afterthought with the shower over the bath pouring water all over the floor as the shower curtain wasn t long enough to reach round the bath the fittings looked tired and there were insufficient toiletries a premier inn room would have been a better option given that the room price was over night which is costly given the quality of the room
