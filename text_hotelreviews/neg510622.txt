our stay began badly as on arrival about our room was not yet ready and we had to wait an hour or so it seems that the hotel has problems getting enough staff cleaning of our room was bad despite complaints except on the day when the regular cleaner was obviously off duty of the two lifts near reception one was out of order for the full week of our stay and another neat the dining room was out of order for four days leaving just two lifts working luckily we were on the first floor so could use the stairs service at breakfast was good and the staff friendly but clearing away from tables no longer occupied was not a priority not enough staff
