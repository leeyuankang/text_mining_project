paid far more than on previous visits to this hotel but that was due to the rugby world cup very disappointed on this occasion the executive double room was poor the en suite was really very small nowhere to put a wash bag and the previous molton brown toiletries have been downgraded to gilchrist soames and were not replenished during our night stay nor indeed were the bottled water or milk there was only one mug for two guests hugely disappointed with the room and housekeeping
