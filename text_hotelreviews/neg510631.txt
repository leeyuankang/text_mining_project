refuse to pay extra for wifi it would be smarter to build free wifi into a slightly higher room rent for a cup of coffee or a short walk there is a better deal just up the road just travelled throughout brittany and free wifi all the way in hotels lack of attention to detail by housekeeping basin plug broken desk lamp not working tv cut off at am wrong check out time on housekeeping list didn t bother me but the rooms and bathrooms are small as a single traveller that could be the reason my rooms over two stays were weeny wouldn t have wanted to be a couple or much fatter
