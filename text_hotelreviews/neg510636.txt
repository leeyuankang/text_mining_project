we have stayed several times at the hotel but on this stay were allocated a very small room i asked to be changed if possible and the desk staff found another standard double room which was only marginally better be warned if the room numbers have double zero eg as there is only squeeze room around the bed on two sides and no room for two suit cases we have travelled around the uk and europe for months and were not impressed by the room size a disappointing stay
