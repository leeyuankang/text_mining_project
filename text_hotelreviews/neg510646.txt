the fact that both wifi and spa swimming pool were separate fees per person we were upgraded to double executive because we were celebrating a birthday so the wifi was included apparently but still these days we thought extremely expensive for pp and we would not have paid it anyway we didn t use the pool either on principle air conditioning in our room seemed very slow so glad we didn t have a heatwave that day as such
