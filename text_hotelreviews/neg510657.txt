in my booking it said free wifi yet i was never given a code or anything and had forgotten till the morning so was pointless by then the car park attendant needs a lesson in manors and how to talk to people and how to smile he was the only real disappointment in the whole visit and annoyed me massively with the way he spoke to me when i tried to park in the underground car park thankfully your staff in the hotel made up for it
