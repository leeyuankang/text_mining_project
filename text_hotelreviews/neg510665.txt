my husband and i both opted for a kensington club sandwich in the bar area which was disappointing as we were not given an option as to what bread we wanted and there was no egg mayonnaise and there was traces of egg shell also the toast was burnt when i tried to explain to the waitress she didn t understand what i was trying to say
