staff very unhealpful especially with regard to car park payments ability to swop notes for coins to pay the meter unhealpfullness with issues raised ie no ownership of problem just a straight no leaving us stuck with the issue spa had no availabiltiy for massages etc completly defented the point of booking a spa hotel mens changing room in repair so the hotel seems to think walking from the spa to a hotel room on the first floor in just swim shorts which were dripping wet after swimming was an acceptable soultion it was embarresing and frustrating also linked with that no mens toilet facility in the spa area so again back to the first floor hotel room
