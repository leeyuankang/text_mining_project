the hotel is undergoing refurbishment of the restaurant and arrangements were made to have breakfast in a nearby restaurant on our first morning the refurbished restaurant was declared ready for the next day this wasn t quite right because the lighting was not yes finished which made the place very dark and gloomy the very opposite condition for a bright start to a new day i understand perfectly that refurbishment is necessary and needs to be done with as little disruption to occupancy levels but due consideration must be given to the inconvenience to guests a mere apology is mean good customer relations are paramount and a convincing gesture of regret is always better supporte with a discount of sorts when will hotels ever learn that repeat business is the key
