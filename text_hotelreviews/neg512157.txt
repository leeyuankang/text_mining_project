it is not as central as it sounded and the hotel itself is very oddly structured so you can be quite a distance away from the elevators or the desk for assistance my hope was that would make it more quiet but really the noise just echoes through the long hallways the bed was two twin beds pushed together which separated a couple of times during the night so my husband just about fell through i just checked my card and there has been an additional charge that i didn t sign for nor was there anything used at the hotel or in the room
