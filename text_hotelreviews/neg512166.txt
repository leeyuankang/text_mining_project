we were in an annexe of the main hotel and had to walk out into the main road and back into the reception area the receptionists description of how to use the public underground car park was misleading and caused an hour of frustration the lift was swipe access from the road but inside the public car park anyone could travel to our floor the road outside was a bit shady after dark
