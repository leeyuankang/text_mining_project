very very unhappy experience the location is bad because it is a little far from center and the block gave us a uncomfortable feeling and the staff told us the air conditioner can not be used at the second night but we can use it the first day the breakfast is euro one person but it is unworthy and the bed sheet is dirty and makes us feel very itching so we feel really angry
