we recently stayed at this property eventhough it was march it was very hot in the room and the air conditioning was not working when enquired with the reception reply was to keep the windows open and sleep and the ac cannot be switched on for some reason could not sleep the whole night due to sound from outside with the windows open some nearby construction happening at night when checked next day morning with the manager available at the reception he gave some unacceptable excuses like this is a city hotel and not a one in the woods which basically meant that we have to suffer some noise levels and started arguing that there was no noise at night etc finally provided a fan for the next night thank god we stayed only for nights
