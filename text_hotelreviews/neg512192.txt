booked a superior room for extra facilities such as mini bar coffee and kettle bath robes sky tv garden view vase of fresh flowers etc our room did not have any of the these when we spoke to the manager he said these facilities were not available in the hotel as all the rooms were standard on their website however they clearly advertise superior rooms at an extra cost a cost which we paid for when showing the manager the website of a superior room i was told that this was only for advertising no refund was offered but instead was told by the manager that if we want a kettle to pick it up from the bar if we want a drink in the room to go down four flights of stairs to the bar the garden view was a street of scaffolding with the hotel situated in the red light district they advertised the superior rooms with extra large double beds our room had two single beds pushed together along with two single duvets overall our room was tired in appearance bedside lamps did not work and what we paid extra for did not exist atlantis hotel is clearly under breach of false advertising beware
