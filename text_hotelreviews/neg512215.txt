not safe position next to a stop at night it was not nice coming back to the hotel room sharing a wall with the breakfast room very noisy when i had asked for a quite room even though i had a double bed they only provided me with one single duvet there was a big gap between the door and the floor allowing a lot of light to enter the room even at night
