i cannot see why this hotel can be rated with four stars the room was very average and the beds were separated in the middle it was a very average room and not at all what i expected i only slept over night however do not go here thinking it is a four star hotel the lobby is very small and i did not like the smell it smelled stale and maybe like smoke i would not reccomend this place due to the fact is is not a four star hotel maybe a three star
