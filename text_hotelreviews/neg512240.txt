vacuum cleaning started too early in the morning in the apartment above us so we couldn t sleep am is way too early for that although our stay was comfortable and enjoyable we wouldn t rate the hotel as stars unfortunately also we couldn t get onto our balcony as it was impossible to open the shutters to gain the access we spent some time figuring it out but gave up in the end
