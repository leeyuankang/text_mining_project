i ordered two double rooms standard b b when we arrived at the hotel we were asked to pay before entering the room that which seemed to me curious so i asked to see the room first we received two relatively small rooms near the hall serving breakfast from these rooms can feel good smells from the kitchen and hall mese in these conditions have asked us to provide other rooms after a little consultation we received two receptionists between rooms to another floor away from the dining room but had to pay an additional price i did not know this at the time when i ordered room on the internet when i asked where the parking lot i received explanations where is the entrance to the parking lot but looked to specify the parking area allocated to hotel guests parking is common with a large commercial complex that it has determined to seek about minutes the area was reserved for hotel guests
