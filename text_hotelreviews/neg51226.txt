the hotel is in a quiet area about a half mile from the closest tube station at victoria this is a short walk if you do it once a day but gets tiresome if you need to do multiple trips or have an partner with a low tolerance for walking the benefit obviously is that the hotel is removed from the noise and bustle around the station
