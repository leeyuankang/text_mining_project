we were kept down the road in another building the reception was far away as was the dining room the air conditioner didn t work the first night and it took the receptionist hours to vine to our room that too at midnight when we were dog tired the room was really tiny but this is europe so i guess we can t expect much we had to plead for a kettle which was given very grudgingly an adapter to charge our phones was given very reluctantly too there were no glasses provided in the room to drink water don t recommend this to any one star they call themselves they re not more than stars
