we were disappointed with breakfast as i do not eat a lot of full english items and when my place came i received one bacon hashbrown and sausage which did not fill me up in the least before a day of sightseeing also as the bathroom is a long and narrow hallway it is difficult to manoeuvre around lastly the noise from guests in the room above was quite disturbing
