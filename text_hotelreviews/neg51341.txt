staff not on par with the stars only one person on staff at the front desk and any given time could not show us to our room or take our bags desk staff somewhat helpful in making recommendations for dinner and current happenings but am surprised by the absence of a dedicated concierge mind you they were never rude just to busy to be of any great assistance
