breakfast expensive and not interesting at all we went out for breakfast and we saved in days the buffet wasn t appealing at all my room a privilege was on floor and we kept hearing a strange noise every night something rolling like furniture but not very loud and no one could tell us what was the problem then my husband guessed it was from the door just underneath opening and shutting the rooms i booked for my family had no view of course that s why they were cheaper but even then very expensive second floor and others are very tiny
