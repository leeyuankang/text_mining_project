when i arrived with my adult daughter i was informed that their system was only expecting one person and that it was a double room there was no apology and i felt their attitude was extremely unhelpful especially when my booking clearly stated it was a twin room for adults and i showed that to the man on reception again there was no apology or any offer of discount all that was said was we are fully booked and this is the only room available the bed was a very small double in a very small room i paid a lot for this room so we would be comfortable and well rested for our early start the next day so much for that i would not stay again having been treated poorly by this one staff member who needs to understand the customer is always right especially when they have an email to prove it
