the bathroom was cramped it was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily the shower spilled water out all over the floor there was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction the breakfast was very disappointing it was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar we had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well i also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked the bacon was quite watery the selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better
