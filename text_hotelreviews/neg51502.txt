i stayed in a standard single room and it was very small i returned to the hotel after a short trip to europe and booked a double single room which was a bit bigger however it was still really small funnily enough by the second day it felt very cosy and a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of london there is no bar fridge although the hotel is located in a very busy area the windows appear soundproofed and the hotel leaves you earplugs on your bedside table i had no trouble sleeping due to noise the rooms were made up everyday refreshed with clean towels and water bottles and amenity bottles the gym is small but has everything you need only one treadmill for running so you need to time your visit the lift also broke down during my stay which i personally didn t find a problem staff happily carried down all my luggage on check out day
