i did not like the lady from reception who did not understand my situation and was rude and unkindly i specify that next day at the reception it was a girl from romania who was very kind and it was huge difference of attitude i have booked a room of standard tween bed and i have got a small standard room with double bed lady from the day i have arrived on of july at about pm from the reception did not even bother to treat with understanding and kindness the situation and worse tried nervously to convince me i am wrong she even assumed very naughty that maybe this is my first trip abroad unfortunately she did not know to whom she had spoken all these happened in front of my young daughter when i have shown her the pictures she separated somehow the beds in the same room she could have done it at least from the beginning without her confusing and misleading words finally she admitted it was no more availability left i have paid through booking com for another type of room but no reaction on that i have not got any penny back
