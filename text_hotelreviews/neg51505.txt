i was very disappointed in this hotel especially considering it was quite expensive i wanted a full service hotel near paddington and could not justify the expense of the hilton the location as all i got the building is dingy the entrance was a walk up and the lobby was miniscule and the service was at best so so the room was tiny barely large enough for two twin beds and was depressisng to stay in i had a one day layover in london and thought it would be more convenient to stay in the city than at the airport wrong on my next one day stay i took a hotel at heathrow popped into the city and then back out the airport hotel was half the price of the mercure was much more comfortable and had a huge lobby overall four times the value besides being cleaner nicer and with more professional staff i am glad i had to endure the mercure for only one day a longer stay would have been awful
