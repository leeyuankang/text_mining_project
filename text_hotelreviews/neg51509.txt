the hotel room was very small given the price we paid we booked a small double room initially when we arrived we were put in a tiny room with either a very small double bed or a slightly larger single bed pushed up against the wall on one side without any room for luggage we asked to be put in a larger room and the hotel kindly obliged however our next room was only marginally bigger on the plus side the bed was large enough for people given the cost of the hotel i would have expected at least what i would consider a standard sized room even though this is a busy part of london
