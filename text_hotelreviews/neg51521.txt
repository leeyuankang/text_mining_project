in spite of requesting with much advance an early check in i had to get ready for a conference there was no availability that was unfortunate but understandable if all the rooms were in fact full the night before however the hotel did not have any kind of bathroom facility where i could get changed let alone shower and i had to use the tiny freezing and not particularly clean toilets in the basement of the restaurant next door garfunkel s that was really not a great start for the trip
