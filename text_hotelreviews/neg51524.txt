the room was tiny making it difficult for two people to walk around the room at the same time without bumping into each other the bathroom was also very small but manageable with nice toiletry items the bed was comfortable but the double bed was quite small a couple used to a queen or king bed would find the size of this bed inadequate we felt this hotel was a poor value for the price of the room
