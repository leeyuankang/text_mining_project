poor visit this time normally stay here for work as it s close to my office several of us use this hotel on this occasion however i received some poor service i couldn t get through to order room service after trying for mins i decided to go downstairs to order from reception directly as i was having issues connecting to wifi too i was on the floor and went down in the lift in which i got stuck the lift broke between floors i was in there for approx mins and had to be helped out i received a hurried apology from reception staff who didn t know i had been stuck was told i could order from her for room service and that was it i received no formal apology no discount i wasn t even offered my room service as a gesture nothing i will seriously consider staying here again if this is the poor service on offer the lift was still broken when i left days later
