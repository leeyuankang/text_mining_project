the first room i was assigned was tiny it was in the fifth floor and the ceiling was in an angle making it claustrophobic the second was on the fourth floor and had a clacking sound coming from the walls that was constant old pipes mod provably the third room was the one i stayed in the staff was very good in accommodating me
