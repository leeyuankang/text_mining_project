the room was so small for the price people have wardrobes bigger i understand that is common for london the sounds of the trains and city outside was loud but they offer ear plugs but after a long day in london i was looking forward to ordering room service and curling up in bed to watch some tv the member of staff there to greet you simply ignored me as i walked in like the other staff also a mear welcome is common courtesy in a hotel i tried for half an hour to get through to reception on the room phone and gave up and went downstairs to order my food to find the reception desk fairly quiet no reason for a phone not to be answered when my food arrived it didn t arrived as i ordered with a sauce for my steak they also brought no cendements no salt pepper etc also ordering a steak no steak knife and no glass for my can of coke so my meal was unflavoured and quite a disappointment i tried to ring again to question what had happened to my topping i d paid extra for and if i could have so condiments once again no answer after finishing my tasteless meal i curled up to watch some tv yet this also didn t work i made an early night of it and still struggled to sleep with the purple lights of the hotel sign outside glaring through the slat blinds that didn t keep out and light at all and had to dodge whilst changing as to not give the street a view my room had the sounds of everyone else flushing toilets and showers shooting down the pipe right next to my room on check out the next morning and paying i wanted to clarify i hadn t been charged extra for the topping i d ordered but not received but the lady at the desk was hugely unhelpful and simply didn t even try to understand what i was saying promptly took my card and stuffed it in the reader there are other hotels in the area with a better price and more to offer
