after reading the reviews we booked a superior room we got a king size bed in a small room the air con was pathetic the free wi fi was ok when it worked and the glass we accidentally broke was left for days and so were the shards of glass in the carpet breakfast was in the adjoining garfunkel who were more interested in the walk ins than the hotel guests needless to say we will not be staying here again
