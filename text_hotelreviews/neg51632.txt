the staffs are very unfriendly may be i am a chinese lady from singapore they do not communicate properly i waited at the lobby after being told that i may only able to get a room till despite of room available i observed that of a guest got his room once he was at the counter n i got up n approach the front desk ladies n they told me that they didn t noticed that i was waiting for a room it was a lame excuse because i was there all that while i don t think i was that transparent for them to not see me
