we had booked two executive king rooms from april till may and again two executive king rooms from may till may from the very first day till the last day of my second lag stay from may till may the lift of the hotel was out of order and me and handy cap person and my aged wife as well as my two aged sisters had to climb floors of the hotel three to four times a day despite of complaining several time no action was taken by the hotel yes in my last leg of the stay the hotel did offer us to use the service lift at the back of the hotel it should be noted that the service lift is in very miserable and dangerous condition which is not at all fit for use at all i have taken some photos of this lift to be forwarded to the respective law department to bring to their attention i recommend the head management to once in a while go and inspect the conditions of the hotels in the back side for safety and for the safety of the staff as well as for hotel guest the most important thing is that hotel should inform the guest before they check in and before taking payment and they should put a notice in bold writing so that in coming guest should know it is very surprising that a simple lift could not we repaired in days despite uk to be known to be one of the advance country of the world repairing lift is no rocket science this days and absolutely not for such an advance country like uk the worst part is that the hotel management had no decency to offer any copmanstation to any guest of the hotel for not been able to provide facilities this amount to defrauding and cheating in the eyes of law
