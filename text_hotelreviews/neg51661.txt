there was a mix up with the reservation different smaller room type than reserved and no breakfast included quickly sorted out when i showed them my confirmation got breakfast and moved to a larger room very noisy with the windows open and keeping cool with the windows closed involves a steady stream of cold air blowing on your face all night i imagine this would be a great place to stay in the winter in the summer not so much
