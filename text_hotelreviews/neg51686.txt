the fire alarm went off twice the night i stayed at this hotel first time at midnight and second time around when i called the reception to ask what was going on the answer i received was this is a false alarm and as i told you the first time the alarm went off there is no problem i had to explain to the person answering the phone that perhaps there was no fire but there certainly was a problem given that i was a paying customer staying at an hotel being woken up in the middle of the night by fire alarms it s great that we live in a time where quality matters and differentiates it would be good if the hotel management would follow this up with customer soft skills training because i felt no empathy from the personnel dealing with this issue
