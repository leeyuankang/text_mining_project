the room was very small but i can deal with it because the location and friendly staff my problem was the cleaning crew chatting and laughing loudly outside of my door every morning that just bothers me so much as i tried to sleep in on a saturday morning after long week working in london it happened again sunday morning i gave up i had no idea what they were saying because i didn t understand their language so i couldn t laugh with them
