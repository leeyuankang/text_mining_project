on friday the me and my partner came to london to celebrate her birthday we booked with the mercure due to location and it s modest views it cost us pound which to me for london is adequate for a star hotel with breakfast however no where did it say there was no bar which was disappointing as it s on he pictures online the lift wasn t working which to be fair they offered to take our belongings upstairs for us that s not a major issue we could see they were having works done on the hotel that s not a problem it was the safety of the guests when we got back from the there we had to wait at the bottom of the stairs well a builder was chipping away at the glass with no cover what so ever it was falling on to the stairs it quite easily could of been someone s face also the banister was that lose on the stairs it come off when i mentioned the stairs all the member of staff did was kick it back in we then went to bed where next door a young child was crying for the best part of hours and i get young babies cry but why put a young couple next to a family and children i called reception two times and no answer after listen to the child we eventually went to sleep the next morning we were provided with breakfast by garfuncals and was appalling the bacon was dry we had a spoonful of beens and the tomatoes were cold we did mention it and was offered another but we went else where when we got back to the hotel to collect the thing they then baracaded the stairs off and said lift only which to me i was dubious as it was down hours before the place just looked like a building site considering i was trying to make my partners birthday her special it was ruined by the hotel paying pound for just a room and a rubbish breakfast is awful you go to places like london for the experience what was i paying for you had no bar or restaurant
