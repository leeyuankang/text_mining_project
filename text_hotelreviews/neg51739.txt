breakfast in garfunkels the waitress didn t seem to be giving me her undivided attention when i ordered my hot breakfast sure enough i didn t get exactly what i had ordered it was taken back to the kitchen and the correct order served with an apology unfortunately the bacon and eggs were cold but the mushrooms and grilled tomatoes were ok as i had to get to a meeting i didn t have time to ask for it to be reheated
