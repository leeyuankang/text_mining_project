the hotel did not allow me to use my hilton honors benefits like free wifi because i did not book through hilton did not give me hilton honors points credit for my one night stay because it was not booked through hilton to the credit of the manager he did credit the pound wifi fee after i challenged the charge to be honest the condition of the hotel is tired and in need of a makeover the rooms are small bathrooms small and dated the walls are scuffed and the facility is not inviting i would not stay here again and would not recommend
