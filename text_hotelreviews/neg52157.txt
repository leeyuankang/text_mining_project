no aircon just a sort of fan system which didn t cope at all with one of the hottest june days ever degrees which as australians we wouldn t really say was that hot but the room was like a sauna and as we were fronting out onto the main road we couldn t open the windows for the noise worst night in a hotel ever we d stayed in the premier travel inn on york way outside kings cross days earlier which was half the price and infinitely better i d never stay in this hotel again putting aside the aircon issue the facilities in the room were no better than the premier travel inn and compared to a true luxury hotel like storrs hall in windermere where we also stayed this trip it s not even in the same league
