any hotel that still expects its guests to pay for wifi services seems to be just a bit in need of money if it can t afford to give its guests such an accommodation it felt awkward to be told that if its a booking com reservation we don t give free wifi it didn t help that the room given to us was so faaaaaarrrrrrr away from the elevator our conclusion was that it was probably because it was a booking com reservation we had requests for either a late check in or a late check out neither of which was granted just a summary not possible the hotel minibar had a fine print note that anything that is moved out of place will immediately be charged to the room whether or not actually consumed how very unwelcoming and inhospitable is that
