very non friendly reception team careless rude we had to pay for the intent in the room because our reservation through booking we had to beg the receptions and duty manager to have late check out at pm while the occupancy was low i could not use the hhonors points again because the reservation was through ebooking like we did a crime we had to beg them to have one single bed instead of twin we asked for good view and we had room which has a long wall just in front of the window they transferred us to room to solve the problem and as an apology from the desk manager and the view was the very close roof of the hotel i will never stay in hilton again and will discontinue my hhonors membership
