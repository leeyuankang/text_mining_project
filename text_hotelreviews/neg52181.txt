think people expect a lot from a hilton sadly this does not deliver rooms are very dated the mattress was so uncomfortable soft every unsprung spring could be felt due to train problems we had to book here quite late so perhaps there would have been better rooms if we booked earlier we went on to stay in a far superior hotel some might even say it was premier it was an ultra modern yet small hub in a fantastic location it was brilliant we managed to get some much needed sleep on one of their far superior beds
