i booked a family room for three after seeing the picture of such a room on booking com which looked spacious enough with a single bed added on the side of a double bed so a long enough room in reality the room was a different type of room most likely a normal room not a family room with a single bed added at the foot of the double bed as there was no space to put the single bed on the side of the double bed and that made movement in the room very inconvenient and impractical for three
