no complentary wifi tv also booked double bed but was given twin beds which was annoying as i made it clear in the requests i was surprising my fianc e why would we need twin bed i find it hard to believe that such a well known hotel doesn t provide free internet tv it charges for everything was charged just for flicking through some channels which i didn t each watch and asked for refund for that
