i was surprised that this particular hilton hotel was so ran down and very badly managed my tv was definitely from the last century and didn t work the clock was showing a wrong date and time the room was dated bathroom was very dated and the plug was stuck the plug control handle was broken the mirror in a bathroom was discolored and chipped i got a discounted rate so my room so i wasn t too upset but if i would have paid for such a room over a night the usual rate i would be very disappointed this particular hotel doesn t deserve a hilton name because it feels like a two star motel on route
