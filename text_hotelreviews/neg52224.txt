my wallet been stolen in the lounge it was too obvious that the cleaner stole it as i forgot it in the lounge s toilet the cctv approved that but no one supported me what i hated much was the duty manager on that day whereas he didn t show any sympathy he was so careless and he didn t try to manage the situation
