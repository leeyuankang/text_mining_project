i had sent a message with my booking nobody got back to me about it not even acknowledging it was read it would have been fine if they said there was nothing they could do but it seems like nobody read it or simply didn t care about my request i wanted to make the stay more special for my wife that had her birthday while we where staying at the hotel hotel was nice but no extra service i just felt like a guest not a valued guest
