at breakfast food is great but my table wasn t properly cleaned for me so i had one unpleasant breakfast i got upgraded to a deluxe room for handicapped it is great but the water pressure is very low not enough hot water and there was rust mold on the railings on the wall seems a bit scary but overall still a very nice place
