we have been staying at the hilton paddington several times a year for several years this year for the first time we booked a room via booking com we arrived in the evening for the stay in a week stretch and the young lady who checked us in demanded a pound deposit for incidentals told us that there would be no included breakfast expected nor free internet not expected and generally treated us like we were less than welcome we were shocked at the negative attitude with which we were greeted because we booked via a travel agent this is not the general attitude that we have encountered at this hotel but it was really out of line and quite a disappointment
