when we checked in i will have to say the young man at the front desk was very unfriendly and very unhelpful not a good way to start a hotel stay i always went to the concierge for help to avoid that staff member the housekeeping staff were very helpful however free wifi would have been good we had just finished a tour of cornwall and had free wifi in every one of our other hotels in cornwall and in london it infuriates me to pay a healthy price for a hotel room and have to pay a day for wifi the selection of tv channels were horrible again our selection at the very small hotels in cornwall were superior to the hilton i understand you don t go to london to watch tv but with free wifi unavailable tv is important in the later evening
