this hotel would have been nice years ago but has been in steady decline ever since the furnishings and rooms are dated and tired the staff unfriendly and unwilling lack of attention to detail e g the back doors connecting to paddington station were locked early in the morning meaning that guests had to walk out the front of the hotel and around to access the hotel this defeated the purpose of staying close to the station overall disappointing and dissatisfying
