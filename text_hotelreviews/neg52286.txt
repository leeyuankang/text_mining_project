staff is quite rude and dismissive first question i was asked is whether i booked through booking com not a very polite way to welcome a guest and gives the feeling of room allocation based on booking type also turns out you are charged for bad wifi skype conference did not work apparently a fee you not charged if you do not book through booking com according to front desk staff at checkout apart from the fact that wifi is free in most public spaces let alone hotels the fact that it was discriminating against a hotel guest due to the type of booking made apparently guests that book through hilton and other sources receive a free wifi code again the words of staff at reception made it even more absurd talking to the on duty manager that day did not help the situation at all very obvious it is a hotel banking on its location with little regard to guests rooms are okay but tiny expected in london i guess and in need of refurbishment
