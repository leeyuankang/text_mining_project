was in room on night of august problem massive dinner party with very loud music in great western room directly below me unable to sleep until music stopped at midnight asked to speak to duty manager but he was too busy checking people in to see me problem consistent cigarette smoke smell investigated and determined it was possibly due to smoke coming in the room windows from some area between the hotel and paddington station
