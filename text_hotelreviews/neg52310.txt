have stayed here twice in the last month and hilton could not find my booking via booking com to make matters worse i was charged then later for a no show which neither booking com nor the hilton have mentioned have also been charged twice on my for my most recent stay and only to phone the hilton when back overseas and not receive any feedback or apology for a clear system and accounting error so do check your statements when staying at the hotel
