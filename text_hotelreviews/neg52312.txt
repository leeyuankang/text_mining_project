this hotel is at the end of the heathrow express but it is not a business hotel the business centre is totally inadequate with limited hours i needed to print colour page but they cannot do this as the business centre does not have a colour printer the night manager does not have access to the business center computers out of hours let s get real this is not good enough for a hotel at the end of the heathrow line i will not be staying here again hilton needs to be business friendly this is from a hilton gold card holder
