that i was charged a deposit fee on check in which i wasn t notified about when i made the booking also the booking said there was wifi but as it turned out wifi was only in the lounge as i had booked through booking com if i had booked through the hilton website apparently then i would have had wifi in the room if you want a late check out you have to pay per hour no chance of keeping the room until they need it just another way for them to make money also there is an entrance directly from inside paddington station this wasn t clearly signposted only found out when i left
