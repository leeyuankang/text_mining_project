the staff who is a french girl in reception for check in are very impolite to guest we had a very unpleasant experience though the duty manager had apologies after complaining but we feel that it is all about racism we had different bookings for nights stay she just checked one booking as we reminded there was another booking she checked again but showed dislike on her face she asked us to sign on the check in form but didn t tell us where to sign we hardly find the right space we had room with breakfast but got no information about breakfast restaurant and time and we cannot get members points even though we are hilton honours member as she told us because we made our booking through booking com her response let me feel that they look down upon booking com
