expected to line up for a breakfast table and wait about an hour but after complaining twice the first receptionist was rude and not interested another staff member assisted and upgraded our breakfast to the executive breakfast room that was well stocked and almost empty they need to get more staff on a sunday morning but overall it was a good stay at a acceptable price for london
