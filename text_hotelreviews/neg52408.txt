room i stayed in had problems with water pressure would be fine then start spitting at me i reported it several times and when they would check it it was fine most likely it was something further in the pipes they did offer to move my room but i had unpacked and it was such a quiet room that i just lived with it few more tv stations would have been nice too room service quite pricey for breakfast really but that s okay plenty of great eating places around or a quick tube ride
