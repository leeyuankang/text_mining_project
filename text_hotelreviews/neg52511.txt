we were disappointed by how unwelcome we felt the whole time we were there one of the concierge individuals was rather dismissive so i guess we looked like ugly americans that really didn t belong there it s ok though we will never go back as there are plenty of less expensive places to stay that are much more comfortable and closer to all the history and cultural sites
