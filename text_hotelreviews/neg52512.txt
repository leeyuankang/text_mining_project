i booked a free cancellation room and months before my check in the hotel booked the amount from my credit card then the day of check in the hotel charged me more money so i asked the front desk staff who didn t know why and the front disk manager came and explained to me that the hotel blocked the amount months ago but then cancelled it and now he need to charge me the full amount again he was lovely guy and helpful i asked him to check with reservation what actually happened and after two days he told me that even reservation does not know what happened i am very surprised that a big brand name does not know what happens in their systems and why they charge a customer twice also the checkout time is and at the room service staff opened the door although we had the do not disturb sign on the door then when she saw us at the room she said oh sorry i thought you checked out she could knock the door first at least instead of opening the door while we are getting dressed
