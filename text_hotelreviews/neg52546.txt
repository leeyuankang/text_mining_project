at breakfast all the staff appeared extremely busy and under resourced there were a few areas which needed replenishing ie fruit juices and sweet pastries which took a while to be filled up we had to ask twice for our teas and the hot breakfast bar didn t look appetising i had to await around for a while before staff asked if i needed something poached eggs please as the staff were rushing around there were occasions when i questioned safety i don t normally fill in these forms but felt on this occasion that i needed to as the hotel in itself is of a high standard i do use the tea coffee lounge area as i work at paddington station and on occasions hold informal meetings there
