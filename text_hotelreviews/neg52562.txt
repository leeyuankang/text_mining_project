no free wifi do places still seriously charge for this staff on the steam bar were possibly the rudest people i ve ever met couldn t get a beer after after deciding to make a sharp exit from the steam bar not sure if everything was closed but the bar was a staff free zone be prepared for a long wait at check in the staff on the desk tried their best but it was a very big queue need a good minutes between toilet flushes so plan carefully if you re not travelling alone
