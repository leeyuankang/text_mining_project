the bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower secondly the beds are not comfortable enough the hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it
