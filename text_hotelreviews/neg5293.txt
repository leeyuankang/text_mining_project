the only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened not a problem with the aircon on but i like fresh air when i sleep the bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own the shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping i guess
