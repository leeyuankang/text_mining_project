i was disappointed i emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted everyone was confused however we were told in the end we could upgrade for another pound a night which annoyed me we did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things the two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying in the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it concierge was very good but depended who was on breakfast was ok but really really busy overrall i wouldnt stay again as i would rather be in the middle of the town we had to take a taxi to oxford st all the time
