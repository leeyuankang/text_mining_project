restaurant is dual purpose good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff breakfast very ordinary i am afraid food from the cooked options cold toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options eggs benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service
