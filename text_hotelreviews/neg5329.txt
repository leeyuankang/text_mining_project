there was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this i would recommend asking for a room with a view i didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor the bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as i was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends
