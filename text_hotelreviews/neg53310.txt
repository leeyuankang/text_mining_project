i had a no smoking room but other guests on the same floor had been smoking cigars so it smelled awful there was a drunken fight in the corridor between a large group of men between the hours of am which disrupted our sleep as you can imagine hotel did nothing to compensate our dissatisfaction received an insincere apology from the guests involved and reception considering the cost to stay in this hotel per night it was incredibly disappointing
