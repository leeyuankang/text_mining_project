breakfast having to wait min for a breakfast order after having spoken to two different waitresses about it is absolutely unacceptable concierge the concierge arranged a car service for us in order to get to euston station in good time to catch our train on the morning we departed prior to getting into the vehicle the concierge confirmed that our bags that had previously been left with the concierge while we ate breakfast had been loaded into the car needless to say we were angry and extremely disappointed to arrive at euston station and find that our bags had not travelled with us they were still at the hotel when we called the hotel about this issue the concierge proceeded to argue with us about it and basically called us liars as a result of the ineptitude of the concierge and the missinformation we missed our originally scheduled departure time with virgin and we were required to purchase two new tickets at a cost of this disappointing end to our stay in london caused us to miss a very important appointment later the same day
