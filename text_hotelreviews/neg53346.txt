having to pay extra to get what i had originally asked for on the first booking form i had filled in which was two single beds in the room when we first went to reception the first person we saw said the room was a double room and there were no rooms with two singles available but they would see what they could arrange after a couple of hours nothing had happened so i approached reception again and at this point another person was extremely helpful and said there was a room with two singles but at a cost of extra so we decided to up grade and thanked this person for their help in sorting our dilemma
