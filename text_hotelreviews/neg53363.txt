when i first arrived the lady at the reception told me that she was not sure if breakfast was included in the room rate because she had lost connection with booking com i showed her my copy of the reservation she said that it was mostly written in greek she couldn t read it she was rude and ironic although i had asked for a quiet room in upper stores the gave me room at the end of a corridor near the place where staff was working gathering towels etc the noises were terrible doors opened and closed several times also the noise from tv in the room attached to mine was terrible and made me call the reception to send someone to that room the most terrible unbearable noise came from the aircondition of my room the view from my room was horrible i attach pictures when i told the receptionist that the room was very small she told me that i had paid for a standard room but i am not sure at all that the non refundable price i paid in august was for a standard room i chosed a superior room i have reserved many hotels through booking com and is the first time that people of the reception had no idea about my reservation
