too many issues to get sorted with the room bath plug not working no remote for the t v piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more there were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places
