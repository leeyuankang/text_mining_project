unfortunately the week we stayed here was the hottest june week for more than years with the hotel not being air conditioned and the ceiling fan in our room not working properly it was extremely uncomfortable in the room it didn t help that when we left the room in the morning we left the blinds down and the windows shut to keep out the heat but always returned to find that the cleaning staff had pulled up all the blinds and opened the windows somehow thinking that the very hot wind would cool the room
