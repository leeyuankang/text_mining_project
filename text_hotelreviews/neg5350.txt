although i wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel i never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival the breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around be prepared to wait some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once but overall nothing major and the good intention is there last thing we were unlucky i guess our room for was on the floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and wifi was fairly weak in or room
