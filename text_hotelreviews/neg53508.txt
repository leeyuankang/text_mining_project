at breakfast we needed to ask for juice glasses and plates it seems odd that they don t have a big enough supply for the number of guests they can accommodate on our first morning the cleaner was vacuuming the front hall while we ate in the adjacent bar i would think that this job could wait until the most of the guest have left for the day they need to provide more and more easily accessible electrical sockets so that guests can charge their devices easily
