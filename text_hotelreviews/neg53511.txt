we asked for the full english breakfast which eventually arrived after about minutes and it was stone cold dreadfull the menu said smoked bacon and tomatoes and it turned out to be green bacon and baked beans it was inedible so we had to go elsewhere for breakfast the room was tiny and the shower was so weak i seriously considered whether it was usable or not
