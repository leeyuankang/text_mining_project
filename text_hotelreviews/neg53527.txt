much too expensive for what it was the bed was pretty solid and the duvet was so thin we were cold all night the room was much smaller than expected considering how much we paid and we could hear everything other guests were doing including brushing their teeth the breakfast was very average and no one seemed to be paying attention when we tried to get coffee
