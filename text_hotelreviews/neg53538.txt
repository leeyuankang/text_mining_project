the first room we were given room was cramped especially for the price had a disappointing shower fixture and a malfunctioning heater that wouldn t shut down even after supposedly being fixed by the staff so our first night was miserable however when we informed reception in the morning we were quickly moved to a nicer room room with a good heater good shower and a useful love seat wish they had a mini fridge to hold our wine and snacks next time we might look for a few more amenities for the price especially in winter
