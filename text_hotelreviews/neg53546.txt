let s start with the fact the room was meant to be superior double hate to think what a normal double was like there was damp in the walls cracked plaster the room was heated to near topical temperatures made it really uncomfortable to be in there was no way to hold the windows open till i wedged the welcome booklet under them to keep them open half the channels on the tv didn t work the cable for the kettle didn t stretch far enough from desk to socket so had to heat a faulty kettle up on the floor which i would think would be against health and safety standards and biscuits included were smashed to pieces the shower was only meant for someone under tall because the overhang of the roof prevented you from getting underneath it and there was no splash guard which meant the floor would get just about saturated resulting in kneeling in the bath tub trying to wash hair then with someone who s previously had back trouble trying to get up and out again not good couldn t stay in the room for long and even took my belongings down with me to breakfast so i could leave as soon as i d finished
