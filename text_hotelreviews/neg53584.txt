the pictures online for this hotel seem deceptive the outside looks nice but the rooms were very small we were given a tiny room on the last floor at our arrival there were two free bottles of water but one was already half used when we took a shower in the evening one towel had makeup stains and dirt it looked like it already had been used the carpets are stained the shower is located inside a bathtub with no curtain to keep the water in the ceiling is slanted in such a way that you were hardly able to use it without touching the wall located very close to an old window with rotting wood the window and floor got soaked every time we used it we forgot an expensive set of ear phones in our room in one of the drawers we contacted the hotel they indicated that the maintenance staff found nothing oh well the service at the bar breakfast room is very unprofessional and would benefit from customer service training
