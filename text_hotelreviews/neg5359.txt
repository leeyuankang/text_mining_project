the hotel like many central london hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes we found one online at upper marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened there are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly
