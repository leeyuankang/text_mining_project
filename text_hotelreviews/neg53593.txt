the breakfast at this hotel was the worst we have ever experienced the breakfast staff were very friendly but didn t seem able to refill any of the dismal selection before it had completely finished nothing hot was served at all and for this price the least we expected were some eggs on our toast don t expect anything more than cereals fruit and some bland pastries here when we complained to reception he didn t seem bothered at all and we just got an oh sorry we ended up having to go elsewhere for a decent breakfast which for the price of this hotel was extremely disappointing luckily we have a sense of humour and the only thing we could do was laugh at how bad it was unfortunately we probably won t stay here again although the location was great the awful breakfast and poor customer service completely let it down much better places to stay for this price
