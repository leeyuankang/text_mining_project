i m really sorry i have been staying at the charlotte street for many years and this time i was shocked by the english language capabilities of some of the staff on a number of occasions i found myself having to repeat myself several times and whilst it was nice to interact with some of the more senior staff certain individuals at the reception and bar should have more training or better communications skills before being let loose on customers i mention this in the hope that management takes my comments seriously as this was also mentioned by two other guests that shared there comments with me whilst we were enjoying a drink in the rear living room also whilst this does not apply to all the service at the bar was dreadful lack of knowledge a total lack of customer skills and general apathy ruled
