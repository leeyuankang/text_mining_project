the hotel has charged my card with a completely different a higher amount than it is stated in the written confirmation additional charges beyond the sum of the booking has been charged separately and properly it s just wrong to charge the card of the client for the stay itself the higher amount which is not in line with the written confirmation and most importantly not according to the invoice of the hotel
