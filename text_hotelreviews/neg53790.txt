i arrived an hour early to checkin and was told that i would be put on a priority checkin this did not happen as i wasn t allowed to checkin until almost an hour after the official hotel checkin time i found some of the staff to be insincere and unwelcoming this is a shame as i previously stayed at the soho hotel a sister hotel of the charlotte street hotel and had a wonderful stay there i would not recommend the charlotte street hotel
