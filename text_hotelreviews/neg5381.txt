the fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well we had to use some of the towels to dry the floor also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about to see if they could get in to clean the room checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and i view from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms this was a shame as being on the floor it would have been nice to have an external window
