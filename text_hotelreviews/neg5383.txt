we were families and had rooms one of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used the staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room they kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day they just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower they used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay the hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care the hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations they must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required the only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night
