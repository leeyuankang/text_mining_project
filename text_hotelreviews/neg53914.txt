the hotel mentions a gym however the gym is just one running machine and a stepper in a closet i think they should be clearer when booking of course there are acres of lovely running in the nearby parks or along the river but i would rather know this up front so i could bring my running shoes as opposed to my gym shoes it is very posh for want of a better word i don t think this is good or bad if you like old school british formal then this will be amazing if you prefer laid back without two people holding a door open for you at every turn then you may find it a little overpowering as i said in the like comments though all of the staff were very friendly its just the style of the place and once you can navigate the small lobby you are all good
