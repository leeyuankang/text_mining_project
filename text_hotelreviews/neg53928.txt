i was especially perturbed that a credit card was entirely blocked by the hotel upon arrival not just the card number recorded as per other hotels but the card credit limit and cannot be redeemed for days after departure this is unacceptable to me and since a card can be blocked in to seconds then why does it take days to unblock it therefore i will never return to the goring again on principle
