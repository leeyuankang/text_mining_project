the only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for the warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat
