the room was meant to be spacious and have two single beds it wasn t and it was one normal sized double bed which i shared with my daughter not arriving to go in the room until after a day at wimbledon i was just pleased to get in the room so didn t query it i have previously stayed at the ampersand and i would return there next time much bigger room and much better value for money on that basis
