there was an unfortunate bungle regarding our viator booked sunrise trip to stonehenge bath and a mediaeval village that day before we left i had arranged for a wake up at so we could meet the tour coach at someone forgot to tell someone we were not woken and missed our tour but after a phone call we did manage to catch an afternoon trip to stonehenge instead the afternoon weather was perfectly clear and sunny the experience very satisfying and we realized that this was probably the better outing in the end so please know that we did what we needed and enjoyed our london days
