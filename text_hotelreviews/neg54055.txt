i booked this hotel more than two months in advance to make sure i have the best hotel in this location the hotel claims to have stars and although i ve never stayed there before i have good memories after staying in another starhotel in genoa which by the way has stars so i was hoping this one will be much better however when we arrived it appeared to be a tiny hotel occupying a part of a floor building sharing it with a bank we arrived on sat noon and since the room was not ready yet we dropped the luggage and went to the city till evening the surprise was when we came back and our room appeared to be on the top floor however it was not a penthouse room roof tops have lower ceilings and inclined upper part of walls which make the room smaller besides curtains are hung at this position and are so close to the bed that it was very difficult not to step on it when getting up from bed the room was so small that if yo lie on the bed it was possible to reach the window up and from the other side of the bed you can open the bathroom door without getting up i could not believe star hotels could have such small rooms it looked rather like a star hotel which the owners tried to upgrade by encouraging personnel to be attentive and offering penhaligon s bathroom cosmetics however out of the whole rage of penhaligons they had blenheim bouquet only which is primarily a men s fragrance my wife asked if they could find some of ladies fragrances they promised to look for it but it seems they have not found any after staying two nights in that small room i had to tell at the reception that the room was small and inconvenient and not exactly what one could expect booking the room so much in advance i have to admit the reception clercs did their best and other rooms of different categories and i have chosen a much better room on the floor which was night more expensive but was much bigger and convenient
