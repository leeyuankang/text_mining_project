after requesting a quiet room i was allocated one on the main road after moving and complaining about having work men looking in to my bathroom toilet which had no curtains and bedroom on separate days for over minutes there was no goodwill gesture made to rectify this i was moved to various rooms al of which had trains from the underground keeping me awake from the fact that exterior building work was being carried out throughout my stay was not mentioned at check in this is unacceptable when paying in the region of pounds per night for a room last visit i had at this hotel my sheets had large holes in them not very impressed by the standards which used to be great here
