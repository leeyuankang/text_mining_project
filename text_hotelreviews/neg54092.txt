we were upgraded to the mews suite which is a seperate mews house around the corner of the hotel we were very disappointed with this mews full of rubbish staff smoking in the mews the house was smelly and tired looking with furniture stained and ripped all in all not an upgrade but rather the feeling of the garden shed
