this hotel doesnt feel like a star hotel for the following reasons no kettle for coffee or tea in the rooms which you expect in a basic star hotel the booking personell was not cooperative we requested rooms in the same floor as we have young children we called a week earlier and sent emails for that and to our surprise when we arrived we found that rooms are two floors apart the next day they transferred us to tiny rooms next to each other but certainly they dont feel like deluxe rooms at all the exact same size as the superior which they asked us to upgrade to fit the extra bed too tiny for an extra bed not worth an extra per night no one to help with the luggage the receptionist which was very lovely offered to help so do the conceirge but you would expect a porter in a star hotel
