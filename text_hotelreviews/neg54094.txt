even we stay on the floor which is on the top floor we can feel and hear the subway train especially at night time also we can hear every single word next door guests talking even though they didn t speak very loud i guess the wall is super thin also the room we selected was not the same as the one we got at all a bit disappointment because we promised our daughters to get the room she likes also we mentioned on booking that we request that room at least should tell if that room is not available
