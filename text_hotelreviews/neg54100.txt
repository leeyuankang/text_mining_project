my booking form confirmed a city view i was put into room on the ground floor which had a window looking out onto another wall no more than meters away with a view of bird droppings on the ground in between i would not have wanted to do anything other than sleep in that room with the curtains closed consequently i went out for most of the evening the room was comfortable but i was definitely tucked away into the corner and they were probably surprised that i didn t complain
