the wifi did not work in my room at all the staff went to some lengths to try and remedy this but in the end we re not able to solve the problem in my opinion this had to do with the layout of the room the bedroom party being isolated from the rest of the room it was very frustrating another thing that really irked me was the lousy attitude of the staff at breakfast not a single good morning i had to call someone over to order tea and was never offered the breakfast menu it is only when i saw other tables being served all sorts of dishes that i realised that there was more on offer than the buffet the staff did not smile we re not friendly and had an unpleasant attitude i have stayed at the pelham three or four times now i think they really need to make an effort to improve the friendliness of their staff
