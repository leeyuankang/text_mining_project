my travel companions room same nightly rate as mine was cramped and had a distinct dust and or mold smell triggered my allergies in about seconds i think you just get lucky or unlucky with a particular room there restaurant was mediocre wait staff was attentive but it seemed like few of them were trained for the jobs they were doing it never seemed to be crowded which was probably a good thing i can t imagine how they handle high volume there are many restaurant choices in the area so it was not hard to find nice alternatives but there were several cold and windy times it would have been nice to stay in the hotel did not buy the add on breakfast and very glad we didn t cost of their afternoon tea was unreasonable and quite a poor value for quality
