stayed days with my family for the london marathon not a good experience the hotel is always crowded and not relaxing rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed in the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed satellite tv always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions the first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators the queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that i was with my parents who had to wait mins standing before sitting inaccurate room cleaning one day room was made at the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap the next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes the first day they started to knock at the door for service at in the morning with people still in the room breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions location near waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street to find some bars overall this hotel was a terrible choice
