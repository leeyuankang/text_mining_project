we booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him we paid a lot to stay there and brought another couples with us and i just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and i would think twice about dining there again other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful
