upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing no external view as requested even though i know not guaranteed our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view i would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view a nice few days spent in london however would not stay at this hotel again
