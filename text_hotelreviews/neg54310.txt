the only thing which could have been marginally better was the meal my starter was superb but my main course of confit of sea bass was just a little too cold and had to be sent back to be warmed slightly and the accompanying pickled fennel with it was too strong in flavour and overwhelmed the dish but as you see i m quibbling over niceties otherwise the south african white we had with the meal was excellent we couldn t basically find fault with anything during our stay other than that minor point everything was superb
