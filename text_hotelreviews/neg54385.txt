the size of the double size bed is really small when i asked about larger beds i was told that they were at king size rooms but the bed itself was comfortable at booking com the rooms we saw had nice decoration which i thought was standard in all rooms but our room had very classical decoration and in fact bathroom did not reach to even stars for me however it was always clean
