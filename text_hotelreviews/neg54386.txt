i didn t quite like the breakfast too much stirred food and bread was not that special but maybe that was typical english breakfast and this is just a matter of cultural differences i m anyhow happy that there were also a lot of fruits available service at breakfast was very good overall but surprisingly there was quite a lot of variation with coffee quality it was lovely and freshly brewed in the first morning then on the other almost cold and not that fresh at all
