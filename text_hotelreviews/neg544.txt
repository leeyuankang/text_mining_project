rigid rules our plane arrives in the morning so i requested early check in in the booking acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel we arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone i started with good morning i know it s too early but i wonder if you ve got a room for us i booked rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport he replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at leave you baggage over there he then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more the tags are in pairs to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining pairs to me as i realised it was self service i did the bags by myself and before i could finish he already rushed me to take my tags i can t believe he could be so rude we brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out we were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around by then we were offered room i saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and i am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already i let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard my bf and i waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them we waited till to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though i requested for it when i made the booking and no reply as well and during the check in i had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info i have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself i understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way
