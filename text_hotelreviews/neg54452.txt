i found it really odd that upon check in staff were asking to charge me an extra for things i haven t ordered that they plan to refund me with after i leave they were also a bit inflexible impatient and rigid in the way they were communicating the request as if it s something that they re entitled to and that of course i should do it it s a minor thing though and i d probably stay in the hotel again if i am in town
