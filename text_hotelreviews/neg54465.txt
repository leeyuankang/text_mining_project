the price how can this be justified we booked a classic king on the basis of images presented on the website although we were given a complimentary upgrade we thought the bathroom very cramped for two people it is smaller than my home bathroom of approx ft the bedroom had no real seating area or table it had chairs a desk and a large couch we couldn t fathom its use in our view the couch area would be better used for a proper seating area table and chairs for room service so was not good value for nights
