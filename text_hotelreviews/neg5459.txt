this room was not worth night i believe that the premier inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities the amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room the wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for room guests the bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force in this case it could result in that person sustaining injury i would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom
