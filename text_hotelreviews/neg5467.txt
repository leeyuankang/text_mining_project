a picture is worth a thousand words added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central london and what you see through your window if you can after paying about per night in a star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at am in the working days sure they do have double glazed glasses but i am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation seems no one reads or cares what is written there in the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed after all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary we will never step in park plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and i will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them
