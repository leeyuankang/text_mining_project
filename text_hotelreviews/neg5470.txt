i wish the staff could speak better english i found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster i m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc a small thing but annoying
