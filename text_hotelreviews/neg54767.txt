the hotel is in desperate need of renovation you can tell that they have tried to keep it up but with cheap budget means also it s not super clean some surfaces in the room and bathroom hadn t been wiped for a long time we stayed in the penthouse suite so you should probably expect even more attention to detail there but unfortunately they missed a bit too much
