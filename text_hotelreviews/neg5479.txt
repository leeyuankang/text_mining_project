the underground waterloo is very busy between am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can we arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location she just did not care at all but this is the case in all london hotels i ve noticed specially with the east european staff members their accent showed through the sighing especially so rude spending a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted as a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying
