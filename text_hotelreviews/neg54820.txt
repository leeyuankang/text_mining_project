i liked everything but the breakfast too little choice not good enough quality bruised apples one brown banana some mandarins mango out of a can no fresh baguette rest of bread quite dry cereals presented quite unappetizing in plastic containers and very little choice a la carte pancakes just not good warmed up in micro wave hence cold and soft when we got them have stayed at many five star hotels in paris park hyatt mandarin oriental grand hotel du palais royal and the breakfast at the sofitel faubourg definitely the lowest quality of all
