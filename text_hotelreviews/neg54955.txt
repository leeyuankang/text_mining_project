the worst thing after a long trip is to come to a hotel check in the room and find out that you have a room with no view i mean a view inside a narrow service void filled with pipes the receptionist reacted with a common answer that they are fully booked and have no other room available after insisting a bit the new answer was that they would change the room the next day one last try after minutes with a little more threating attitute we were offered options with floor to ceiling windows looking to the street so the question arises why didn t they offer this room in the first place that i still dont know but i can assure you that i was not happy with the whole situation i also had to carry all the luggages by my self from the car to the room and from the old room to the new room which was not pleasent
