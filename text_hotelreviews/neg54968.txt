the hotel after my reservation with kids wanted to charge me euros for the crib the family room was actually rooms which wasnt clear as i showed that i have a baby months old i was put on a floor that has only stairs access the elevator is small and very slow they keys system is not reliable i had to return the keys every time i leave the hotel the extra bed brought in was broken and no back charge was done after paying the full amount i was asked to pay during check out and if i didnt insist that i did i would of been charged again the cleaning materials were on every floor and they didnt have a place to store them
