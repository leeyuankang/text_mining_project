one staff member johann is young and needs to learn more about serving customers twice he kept us waiting while he did other things if the policy is for clients to turn their key in at the front desk when going out the staff needs to give us our key as quickly as possible when we return johann was on the phone when we returned he remained on the phone without trying to get us our key then he out the phone down on the desk to do something else he then resumed his conversation on the phoen all this time while we waited he finally gave us our key about minutes later we feel this was an inconvenience that should have been avoided also our room was very hot despite our turning the heater off i called the front desk and was told to open the window it was okay for a while but the temperature was cold outside so we had to close the window then suffer from the heat
