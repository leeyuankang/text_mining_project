stayed in a family room and shower was leaking i slipped whilst pregnant and hit my head on the stone flooring when i highlighted the leaking shower to a staff member they were fully aware of the leak and said that this was the best room in the hotel to which i responded i d rather have the worst room as long as it s safe this room should not have been booked out especially knowing that children would be walking in and out of the bathroom staff were not friendly at all
