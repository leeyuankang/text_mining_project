i did not like the glass toilet door when two people stay together it feels uncomfortable to use the toilet also i did not like that the door of the shower it did not close and there was water everywhere after having a shower i did not like the waitress in the morning at breakfast most of the time she was not around when you ask her for something she was always grumpy it would be nice if there were spare plates on the bar or nearby we used only one plate which was on the table for the entire breakfast i used the same plate for scrambled eggs and ham croissants with jam and fruit
