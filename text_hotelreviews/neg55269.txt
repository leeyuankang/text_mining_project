we arrived at the hotel on the hottest day in paris the air conditioning in our room and the entire hotel was out the staff would not make eye contact when we inquired and only kept saying that someone will be out here soon to fix it it was a miserable stay and the staff did not even try to bring fans or ice buckets or accommodate us at all i wish we had moved hotels when we had the chance
