one day they forgot to clean my brother s room never understood why the room and bathroom were really cleaned sheets and towels changed everyday however the wc brush was really dirty when i arrived and there was always some kind of faint urine smell near the toilet so that created some uneasiness every time i had to go to there i did report it and someone went right away to try to fix the problem but it never really went away i wondered the whole time if they did not use some cleaning cloth on the toilet and elsewhere maybe on the walls i don t know so i became afraid to use the drinking glasses and stuff thus the reason i did not give a better rating on cleanliness you have to go to the whole process of reconnecting to wifi everytime your computer or telephone goes to sleep which was very annoying especially that some times it will take time to find the connection but once you are connected the wifi worked well
