the only thing that let this hotel down for me was that i could hear loud bass in my room so you can avoid it from the music downstairs i had to wear earplugs at so i could sleep i did tell the receptionist who turned the music down but when i came back three hours later it was back to its original volume what a shame as it s almost the perfect hotel and this is such a simple thing to fix
