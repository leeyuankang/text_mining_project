the door of our room was left open after cleaning when we complained about this the reception clerk did not say sorry or showed that he was going to do something with this complaint he just said the hotel is very safe and we need t worry still this is a weird response when your valuables and private things are lying in a room for the taking it just felt bad that our door was left unlocked for a whole day and we did not even get an apology furthermore the breakfast was not replenished when we arrived at the breakfast service ends at when we asked the reception clerk if some fresh food could be prepared in the kitchen he told us there would be enough in a few moments but as stated above there wasn t sufficient bread butter jam dairy or anything else even after minutes on top of that the bar where the food was presented looked messy this didn t really convince us to stay and wait for fresh food instead we chose to have breakfast at a local boulangerie one more point but this is personal i guess the queen bed comfortable but quite small so unless you like this a hotel with a bigger bed could have your preference so all in all the hotel was allright but you can certainly have better service elsewhere because of the above we would not recommend this hotel
