everything else i booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week the stay was for myself and my parents i havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before i get married firstly booking com has advertised the room i was booking with a picture of the room with a view to london eye or big ben did we get that view not at all and we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door my mom is disabled so i went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect so they changed our room to a junior suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station i have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to big ben or london eye which they said is not their fault and theres the shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the shard is in the city this is the city view you can say that pretty much about anything i appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until i realised that the spa bookings i have made for myself and my mother have not been made complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay there were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof i have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes the next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again i have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life
