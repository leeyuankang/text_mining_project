room is way too small even for paris it doesn t have a fridge and the bathroom is very very cold i can t imagine how hard it is to take a shower during the winter on that bathroom for the price i paid the hotel is great but for the full price for a deluxe room no way btw i booked the most expensive room deluxe and on the reception desk i was informed that i won a upgrade but how come an upgrade if i already paid for the most expensive room and the room was exactly the one i ve booked on the website weird
