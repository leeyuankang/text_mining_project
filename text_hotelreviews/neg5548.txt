found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed unfortunately they didn t sleep very well we had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel
