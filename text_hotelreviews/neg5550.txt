the fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you i found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that i paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so i paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund
