your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when i asking if i have my room card and if i am a resident the talk continued for minutes where every service which i originally came for was not available hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam but good job you took my money you are good capitalists
