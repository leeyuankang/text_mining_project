the rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning the rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant i didn t sleep until you can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and i m a light sleeper also every time i ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road
