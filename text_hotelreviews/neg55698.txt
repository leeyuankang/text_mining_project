the only complaint i had was more based on a misunderstanding between the staff that checked us in and who was there at night the night staff essentially checked us out without knowing we wanted to pay separately and in cash for the rooms this is a really minor dislike more of an inconvenience the wifi we were told did not work on the floor while we were there so we would have to use lobby but by the evening the wifi seemed to be operational
