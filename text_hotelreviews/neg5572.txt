staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the express box bedroom layout was odd tv in front to dresser instead of a mirror that was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal room was so hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good little confusing as there are park plazas next to each other food drink is dear but its london so nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the southbank which we did but everywhere closed around so hotel has a captive audience as it were overall a nice but pricey stay
