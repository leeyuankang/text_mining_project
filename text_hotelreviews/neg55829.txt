the air conditioner always on automatic system it seems like they care about the people who get cold only and i m always hot so i suffer every time and no one fixes it to be completely honest the last two stays was really a tuorter to me i slept without a blanket from the heet and i had to open the window for some cold air and it was a weekend so it was really noisy and loud so i didn t sleep until am just trying all night and thr tv wasn t working properly and no arabic channels it s a hotel it s spouse to have at least one channel from each region because not only locals staying in also foreigners and tourists and i m a usual customer and not once i ve been given a free weekend stay i would appreciate some appropriation as a customer the marriot hotels do it also amba hotel
