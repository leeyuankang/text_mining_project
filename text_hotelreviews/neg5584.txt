the most awful hotel that i have ever lived in the staffs were not friendly and nobody helped us with our luggages when we checked in till we asked the heating in the room was either extremely too hot or too cold we couldnt adjust the temperature in our room we had to call to the reception to let people do it over and over again we stayed there for three nights and none of the nights were comfy definitely not worth for the money that we paid very disappointed we would not choose this hotel again and we are not recommend this hotel to anyone
