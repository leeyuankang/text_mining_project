i stayed in the single room though it was ok in terms of room size london hotel standards there were several problems with the room shower and toilet are in separate areas of the room not separated with xxyy but really in separate places the sink size no more than a paper i guess it was intended to wash hands only otherwise it was a joke by the interior architect the room was heated by a air conditioner so you had to choose from either a very cold room or a very dry air in the room to reach the room you need to cross several corridors each with different altitude so if you have a heavy luggage you will need to hop up down several steps on your way to your room the location of the hotel is great however the room is on the noisy side because of ineffective sound also heat insulation hence you are greeted with complimentary earplugs on the bed side table in case you would need
