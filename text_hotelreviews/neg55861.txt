high cost for such poor standard of accommodation wallpaper ripped or peeling off painted woodwork all scuffed missing light bulbs scratched baths water leaks evident in bathrooms broken bath taps very noisy bathroom fan hairdryer not functioning correctly we were upgraded to an apartment which was unsatisfactory and then viewed other rooms in a similar state before opting for the least worst old fashioned decor the whole hotel needs a refurbishment if you are spending per night you can find much better elsewhere
