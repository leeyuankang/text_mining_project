i didn t have enough cash to pay my ride so i asked the lady receptionist to give me to pay off before i go to atm to withdraw and pay back she was about to give me the money when she got stopped by one of the supervisors who said that s not allowed i had to then ride back to the atm which costed me double original cost on my return the same supervisor told me that he stopped it because it would have meant paying a charge i was furious as that s not what he had said initially i could have made that call rather than paying double rate also i couldn t understand why he didn t say that at the beginning
