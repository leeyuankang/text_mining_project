it s not my first time in the leonard the ambience was loud and noisy we called the reception times because there was to much noise in the above room because of the floor the room bathroom was very old you need to have a new furniture also the most upset thing was when we wanted to have a late check out for of the room at least for an hour they didn t approve it was very upsetting thank you
