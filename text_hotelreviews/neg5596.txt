didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the london eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel also that the bathroom sink was blocked the burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments no ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold very poor also the pasta in the italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order
