classic double room number had lovely decor but the actual bed was accessed by a set of stairs which had no railing and once in the room there was nothing to prevent you from accidentally stepping into the stairwell as only a narrow space existed between it and the bed as international travellers we had luggage that wouldn t fit in the room the wardrobe was converted into a mini bar so no hanging space was available we asked to be moved and were offered the only room available which was in the basement at pounds per night extra whilst this room was more spacious a faulty air conditioner leaked water down the wall over power points and the rug staff advised they would have someone attend to it on returning to the room we found that the wet towel we had used to mop up had been removed rug and skirting still wet the canvas picture i had taken down from the wet wall had simply been rehung the back of this was so filthy with old water stains and mould it was clear that this was a long term problem which they had no intention of fixing very disappointed and felt ripped off and at a loss to understand the meaning of star rating
