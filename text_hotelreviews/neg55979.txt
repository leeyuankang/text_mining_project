i am a regular customer of this hotel however this time i was very dissapointed as i asked for an extention and the receptionist said that the room is booked and he can not make an extention i found out later that this was a lie i left my mobile phone charger in the room and came back at pm to ask for it the room was not occupied yet and someone has went to search for it and came back with nothing this absulotely unacceptable i will not stay in this hotel in the future
