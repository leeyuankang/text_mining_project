i came with family and we felt the room carpet was not clean it felt itching we sat on the carpet also it seems the floors in the hotel were made of wood as we can hear the walking steps from people in the room above us luckliy it went quiet when it was time for bed however there was another source of noise in the room that sounded like a discontinuous extractor or fan and was noisey to me i reported that to the reception who attempted to resolve it but it didn t work so i had to wear ear plugs to be able to sleep
