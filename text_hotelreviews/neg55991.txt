we stayed in a room on the floor which meant we had an extra staircase because the elevator only gets to the floor still it wasn t so bad since we had help with luggage when we arrived and left and were able to leave the stroller downstairs in the lobby the room was not tiny but fairly small with not a lot of closet room
