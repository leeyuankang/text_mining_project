room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning luckily with a year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette
