we were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this there was no kettle even in the room until we requested one we chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason on complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested an offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night
