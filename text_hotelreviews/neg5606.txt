reception staff we paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount times again they were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement we also got charged small random amounts each day and there were extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have it was lucky we checked the charges they refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic
