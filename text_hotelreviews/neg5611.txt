the advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself the check in was delayed by about minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room very poor check in and unproffessional no sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water there is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with the access to the internet on the tv is blocked very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price
