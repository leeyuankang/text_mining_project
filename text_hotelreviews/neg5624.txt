when we booked hotel back in jan we requested room with a view of london eye in november had email to say our room did not have a view we could upgrade for a night unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount so we had no choice we were on level and waited on average minutes for of lifts really bad on arrival we were offered breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on first morning there was a que of about minutes for a seat in the dining room not what i would have expected for this class of hotel
