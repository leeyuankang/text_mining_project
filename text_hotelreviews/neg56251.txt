when we arrived in reception at we asked if our room was available and if it would be possible to check in a little earlier than we had travelled a long way and it was very hot the girl on the desk i didn t get her name she had a foreign accent and wasn t working later on was exceptionally rude she answered very abruptly that the room wasn t ready and we almost got told off for asking the question such a shame as the rest of the staff were nice she was really snooty and not friendly at all her attitude was basically how dare you ask to check in early and why are you bothering me queen rooms are tiny fine but tiny
