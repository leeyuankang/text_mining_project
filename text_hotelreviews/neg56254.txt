room windows curtains looked worn not really up to star standard let alone the fact that this was a star hotel room never cleaned throughout my stay no morning tea sachets etc left after check in date noisy air conditioning rattling all night long room quite small for a twin bed layout i have stayed in stars where bath robe slippers etc have been provided this was very basic by comparison definitely not worth per night
