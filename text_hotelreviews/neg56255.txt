the booking in was cumbersome tiring and unnecessarilly time consuming especially after a long journey the admissions desk was tucked away and very small when more than visitors visitors were there at once we were asked for our passports emails etc even though we were obviously uk citizens and it was clear they already had all this information via booking com a number of the staff we encountered had a problem with english which was difficult at times the restaurant was just a caf really not what we would have expected for a hotel of this status
