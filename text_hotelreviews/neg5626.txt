there seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and booking com we arrived on christmas day and the hotel was fully booked upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though i specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children i even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this the staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the floor which was great the troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast
