we felt that the staff were a little sombre and unfriendly when we arrived around at the hotel we were told our check in was at and we weren t able to go up to our rooms even though our online confirmation stated that our check in time was at we waited about a half an hour until we asked a different person at the front desk and were then able to go up to our room also the toilet in our room produced a very foul unpleasant stench like sewage which permeated the room and made it difficult to sleep this continued throughout our stay
