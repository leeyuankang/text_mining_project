they really need to buck up with the restaurant one evening at i invited people for a drink the waiter i tried to signal to just nodded he passed by again and saw me looking at him he never came up to me but i found out from overhearing what he said to a table of customers who arrived after me that they were not serving any more as they had no personnel he didn t even have the decency to inform me meanwhile one of his colleagues had the time to come out and take a photo of some other guests so what was that about and might this waiter with the sour face be reminded that he works in the service industry and that paying guests are not to be ignored another evening i went there for a drink with guests we ordered drinks listed on the menu the waitress returned to say that the beer we wanted wasn t available then she brought bottles of the fruit drinks that we had not ordered when we pointed this out to her she said the fruit drinks we ordered from the menu were not available but that the ginger beer she brought not on the menu was so why do you bother having a menu on the last morning at breakfast i asked for coffee and was served a cappuccino which brings me to communication in all areas especially the restaurant your personnel could do with a few lessons in english you are in england after all
