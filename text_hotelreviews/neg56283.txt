i didn t think that the public seating areas were sufficiently large there is a restaurant open all day and a seating are with tables and chairs but no other public lounge at least not one that i found otherwise we both enjoyed our weekend and were comfortable in the hotel just be aware that there is a hilton hotel at queensway yards down the road and taxi drivers can be confused unless you specify hilton doubletree on the the corner of bayswater road and st petersburgh place
