our check in was delayed as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many london hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general the friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill this experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels
