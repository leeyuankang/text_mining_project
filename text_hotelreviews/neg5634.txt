my but now final stay at the park plaza county hall what has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations night stay in a studio king family with plenty of issues studio king is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor the lift simply prioritises higher floors every time yes there are stairs but with a month pregnant wife i shouldn t have to rely on them breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace mins average wait for a table temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool shower water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting mins i had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel all in all an absolute joke yes i understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation what was my go to central london hotel is now a never again hotel
