staff in the restaurant are rude in the evening not prepared to help make you feel rushed check in process could be quicker perhaps look at an online check in system where people can check in and keys are ready for you rather than have to sign different pieces of paper present card to be scanned for room charges even though stated we would be paying cash for anything staff at breakfast rude and walk away before you finish asking what you want we paid for one evening and didn t feel we go much for our money different menu is in the room from what you can have in the restaurant we felt confused when going into the restaurant as they had closed half of it for a art class so wasn t actually sure we could go in so we ended up having to go outside to walk round to the other doors to get in as the part joined onto the hotel was the part with the art class in which the teacher had a microphone on so the whole restaurant could here what he wanted them to do very off putting when trying to have a meal and conversation fresh milk could be left in the mini fridge which was empty rather than uht in the wardrobe
