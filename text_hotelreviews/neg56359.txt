we were asked if we would accept a disabled persons room and to be helpful we did however we were not quite as happy with it due to the very small cloakroom sink and lack of shelving space provided in the shower room wc for toiletries etc we also think a disabled person would struggle quiet a lot in this room to make use of the facilities
