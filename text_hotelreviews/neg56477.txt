the night staff were appalling the assistant manager had terrible bad breath he also disagreed with a simple helpful suggestion i made about a hook on the front desk my wife is gluten free and when we asked if any of the night menu options were gluten free the staff failed to be able to find out this information we had no decaf tea bags in the room we asked for some and some extra milk they took ages to arrive when they did they forgot to bring the extra milk didn t bother to ask has too tired and exasperated by then
