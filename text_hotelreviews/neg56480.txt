the housekeeping staff was very keen for us to leave the room the housekeeping staff knocked on the door at and we weren t quick enough to answer and they tried opening the door luckily we had the security chain on the staff then left but she knocked on the door again an hour later this was on a bank holiday so we were planning to have a relaxing morning and the check out time was not until anyway
