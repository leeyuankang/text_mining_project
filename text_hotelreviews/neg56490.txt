on the first morning at breakfast nobody came up to me offering tea or coffee though i was at the table for about minutes when i brought my jumper for laundry the reception staff forgot to send it to be washed this never happened to me in any other hotel of the world old and ineffecient air conditioning when it was off the room got hot up to degrees to cool down the room air conditioning had to be put at full speed which was very noisy
