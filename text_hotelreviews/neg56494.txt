as others have said some staff were totally rude also our biggest gripe as a party of four having booked two rooms on the same reservation and travelled over hours to get to london only one of our rooms was ready on arrival check in at we arrive at and only one rooms was available the host who had a trainee badge on was rude unhelpful and abrupt no amount of warm fresh baked cookies can make up for surly staff and no room after a long drive when asked how long our room would be she replied maybe half an hour maybe two totally unacceptable and i will be emailing doubletree directly as well not the standard you would expect
