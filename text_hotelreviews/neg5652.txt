room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did
