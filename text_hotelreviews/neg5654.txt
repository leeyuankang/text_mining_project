we were in a studio adjacent to the atrium whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise the bedroom is near the door right at the atrium it s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary on the second day when checking out i asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room i believe so they could hear for themselves we got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken with the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out
