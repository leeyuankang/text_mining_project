the only thing which annoyed me a little is that they took a deposit off me which i guess was for room service or the bar or facilities which cost something however this wasn t stated that they would take this deposit before we got there the other hilton hotels we have stayed in have never asked for this now i m still waiting for the money to go back in my bank from nearly a week ago but overall it was good
