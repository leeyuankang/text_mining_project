the service of the staff at the breakfast and during dinner was really slow not very friendly and willing to help though we stayed in a nice room with a king bed there was no room to move around no chair and small table to place a coffee and sit to relax the loby of the hotel has no sofas where one can sit and relax or wait for friends
