was booked into accessible room by accident via booking com later found this to mean disabled facilities or invalid room very confusing as to a stranger accessible means able to gain access to as a result my partner and i had to endure a washbasin ridiculously low to the ground and a seat being in the shower the room could not be changed due to non availability of a normal room it should be clear on the booking form what accessible room means ie disabled handicapped facilities preferred additionally due to being allocated this kind of room we were placed on the ground floor at the back of the hotel and had no chance despite prebooking of a higher floor with a park view
