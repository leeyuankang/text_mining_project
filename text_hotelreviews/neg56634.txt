firstly breakfast advertised at not the case hidden in the small print is you have to book breakfast in advance to get it at this price and it states this no where on the booking not impressed at all otherwise you are ripped off at for one breakfast booked on second morning and got at a price not the advertised price on booking website at which is added to your hotel room debit or credit card which again they don t tell you felt pressured to finish breakfast by member of staff maybe felt i was eating too much but at i was going to eat as much as possible also not consistant was not asked if i would like tea or coffee on first morning but was asked on second morning secondly on occasions our bedroom door was opened one by housekeeping when their was no tag outside the door to come in and secondly without any warning heard our door opened and closed again not feeling too safe with this happening
