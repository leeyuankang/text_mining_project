we booked a king size room bed but stil both the room and the bed were quite small the bathroom was absolutely tiny you could just about get in the door and close it behind you and had to squeeze past the small sink in the corner and carefully try to manouver degrees to sit down on the toilet which was wedged behind the shower cubicle i am average size but a bigger person would never have been able to use this bathroom or shower also the doors to the rooms are very poorly insulated you could hear everything outside as if the door was open including a lengthy and loud conversation between cleaning staff very early in the morning
