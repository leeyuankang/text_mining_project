the view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant this rendered the room windowless like a prison there was no milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew the mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then there were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up breakfast was overpriced i know london is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning
