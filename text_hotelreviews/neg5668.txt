we have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience when checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip when we checked in i was asked if i wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which i did but was charged just for doing so when i asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full english breakfast we paid for didn t even have bacon the shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding in the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over london but on this occasion our view was the waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed finally when we was getting ready to check out at we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that and when it came to checking out we was waiting around minutes just to do so it s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now i feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else i will consider returning in the future but on my trip to london it definitely won t be at this resort
