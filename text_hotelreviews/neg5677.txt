there was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus the staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away the view from our room was not great we faced waterloo station but i m sure the other side of the hotel could see the london eye the bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust
