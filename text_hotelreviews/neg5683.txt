the first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments so as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts they are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile im pretty sure thats what youre paid for also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for we finally got to the station running to catch our train from london euston time we got there we missed our train by all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain you cost me to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us i was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you
