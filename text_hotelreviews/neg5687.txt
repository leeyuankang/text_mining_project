i paid the room service bill before i actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute i run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary the taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession i know how tight turnaround is there was only one t bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc the cleaners were also trying to enter the room at and out check out was we inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no make sure you get the right hotel
