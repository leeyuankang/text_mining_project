the bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room i was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all i wont be going back there anytime soon
