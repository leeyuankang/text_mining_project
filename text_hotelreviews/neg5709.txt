i was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about unlikely to return on this hotel all the while i thought i could experience star experience it was not i was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the star hotels i been through for a a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby
