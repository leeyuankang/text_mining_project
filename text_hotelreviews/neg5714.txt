the room was dirty dark without view even from the floor the service was slow we asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour the breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish we requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option we did not receive any reply when we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another pounds per hour it seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked
