my only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well the sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them and we didn t get enough towels for the whole family we were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway also extra pillows would have been nice too the kids never complained about the sofa bed
