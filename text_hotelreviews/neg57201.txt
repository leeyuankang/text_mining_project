the rudest staff i have ever encouraged in any hotel in the world i will never walk through the doors of the ritz again they need a lesson in how to treat their guests i suggest they send staff for training at the savoy a truly world class hotel because the ritz is clearly posed itself well above the station of of its guests thinking the staff can treat their guests as second third or lower class citizens they have their whole attitude upside down the savoy saved me and from there and provided me with the most welcoming and wonderful stay
