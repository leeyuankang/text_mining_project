staff the housekeeping staff were perhaps shy they would almost never greet us if we walk past them it should also be a practice that they knock first before opening a room once i was by the door checking my outfit in the wardrobe mirror when a male staff just literally unlocked the door and barged into the room we were both really shocked good thing i was not naked he was very apologetic and speechless and ended up asking me if there was a maid in the room turns out he was supposed to go into the room next door oops service we availed to have the daily telegraph delivered to the room each morning however we only received it on one occasion this is not really a big deal for me but i would expect greater attention to detail from such a hotel
