this is one of those places where you would pay more to feel cheap being so proud of keeping the traditions this hotel s management forgot the importance of customer service although i needed to have food in order to take my medication before leaving for a meeting the hotel refused to provide any food for me other than the breakfast i almost begged them for something quick like a croissant they asked me to order from the room although i told them that i am in hurry for a meeting before my flight and there is no time for a full breakfast they also told me that there are so many great places outside the hotel which i can get some food in although it was raining heavily i came back and asked whether breakfast is still available instead of answering me with yes or no the feedback was we do not allow jeans after that they would tell me no food is available now i find this too rude keeping the high society manners is not only about the looks but also about how you treat other people paying for an expensive hotel room within a hotel which identifies itself as prestigious should only mean that i will check out feeling great dress code was listed on the website briefly and the meaning of smart casual was not explained why would i need to have food outside the hotel just because you would not want to be generous enough to offer other quick options an annoying capitalistic approach which is very rude and not so kind next time if i decided to enjoy the interior design of the ritz again i will make sure to pack my fur coat and diamond earrings to get a better service the ritz ruined my happy london trip
