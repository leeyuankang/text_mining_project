i hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door it was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy the checking in and out process was not smooth room was not ready when i was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready when i checked out i was given somebody else s bill i did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price i was charged
