overpriced and overrated with laughable priced drinks bathroom needed updating grouting shabby stain around base of toilet bowl this hotel lives on it s tradition reputation and it s name i think it could do with stepping up the mark in terms of refreshing each room s d cor overall it was ok but there are other hotels with better facilities and more realistic prices it s a shame as was expecting so much more it was a nice experience though
