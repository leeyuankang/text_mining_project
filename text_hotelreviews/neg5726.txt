staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before we waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready after a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity the delay did not help i did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel yet the staff were a smiley as they could be not entirely bad
