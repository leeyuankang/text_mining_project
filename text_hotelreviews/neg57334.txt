none of the instructions i requested were followed but was taken care of after arrival i had booked rooms and was told rooms werent ready for check in rooms became available at around pm but of the rooms was not up to specs and i had to get it changed yet again hot water stopped at the following morning but engineers fixed it promptly and they gave us an extra hour to check out the bathroom light was constantly flickering the staff it seems dont pay much attention to wear and tear as also evidenced by the huge crack in the wall as soon as you enter the hotel on the right side booking com said free parking but they charged pounds for parking cars overnight i had guests from the usa who were not very impressed with the ritz at all and suggested that for the money i paid we could have gotten a much better experience elsewhere there is no swimming pool excellent afternoon tea but i would not stay at the ritz london again the seasons hotel is definitely a better experience
