it took ages for us to be able to check out the staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up my husband i were waiting patiently for a long time for the or staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour it was far too slow
