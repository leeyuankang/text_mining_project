it was needed to ask for hours late checkout i was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather i thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request i spent a lot of money during my stay i was just asking for hours for free the staff did not call me i thought that they are accepting my request in fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours i was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just hours it looked like stolen issue therefore i really would like to refund my money the supervisor did not care i confirmed to her that i will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her t shirt as a kind of the confrontation
