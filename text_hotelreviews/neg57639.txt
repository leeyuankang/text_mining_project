everything was very disorganised a booking of rooms caused great confusion and my husband and i were given a room key for the room where our friend had already checked in we walked straight in on him thankfully dressed they did give us complimentary breakfast to apologise which was nice but it did confirm that i would never pay the full price for the breakfast it was very average and they charge something like per person per night service in the bar was very slow and breakfast was also slow service hard to get a coffee for example they then overcharged my credit card and i had to call back once i realised to get them to refund the difference lots of style with not a lot of substance unfortunately
