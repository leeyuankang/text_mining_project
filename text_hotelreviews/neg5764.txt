requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then the noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel
