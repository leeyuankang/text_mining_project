the hotel look good if you don t look too close for a luxory hotel star we were missing the detail care everthing was aranged and without love looking on the surface everthing was shining but if you were looking behind the doors or some parts of the furniture it was dirty and looked worn and loveless the same is the pool and spa area the showers behind the pool and all the other parts of stainless steel are rusty because it is the wrong material it is and not if you look behind the shower doors it is dirty moldy and greasy we choosed the hotel also because it has a roof top bar but it was only open for private events and some of the waiters told us it is going to be closed anyway it would have been good to mention it on the homepage the service personal is very good and fiendly nothing to complain the rooms are nice and comfortable the only thing which is missing are the toilet brush in the bathroom the breakfast is not worth the money the position of the hotel is excellent
