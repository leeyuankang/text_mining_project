the place seems to be very understaffed and the staff that are there are not terribly helpful and perhaps poorly trained it took a very long time to get a room service menu the reception telephone seems regularly unstaffed as it rang out quite a few times the room is also filled with these ridiculous gimmicky controls that are not terribly good the lights and air conditioning for example are controlled by tablets and ours did not work very well and crashed a couple of times give us the tablet by all means but also give us light switches as an override also it was pm and the roof restaurant was closed and the bar not staffed
