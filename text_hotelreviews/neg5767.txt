every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel in addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not other than that everything was good
