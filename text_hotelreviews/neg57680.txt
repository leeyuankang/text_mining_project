pool spa facilities were out of order both days we were there and this was a big reason i chose the hotel in the first place i was only offered an alternative minute walk to another location s pool on the second day in the evening so that didn t help much the first day it was implied we would get some complimentary drinks food to make up for it but we didn t receive this either considering how crucial the wellness area was in my decision to book the hotel it was very disappointing that it wasn t available and even though i know unexpected issues and maintenance can happen i would have expected an effort to make up for it
