reception was a not efficient i tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that i pay the first night i told her that it was better if i do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if i want to pay the rest of my stay so i thought that was really bizarre she wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good
