one of the ipads was hit and miss didn t work properly for our stay and the maintenance team visited a couple of times to establish issue never really solved it during our stay they were polite and also the hotel offered some wine to make up for inconvenience but we will go back to stay here think we were just unlucky with our particular tech in our room
