it was excellent to have a gym there but for a modern hotel the gym could have been better equipped for example it was very small and not many weight machines although the cardio equipment was fine the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate was a real downside for us as we are vegetarians vegans we never make full use of everything in a buffet style breakfast anyway so we were not willing to pay extra for it
