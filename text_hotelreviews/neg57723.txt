personally i feel this hotel is over priced i booked this hotel because of a special offer on booking com the price for a deluxe double was reduced from to the price i paid i think was fair for the room but if i d paid i wouldn t have been very impressed it s a nice room but i wouldn t say it was superior to hotels which charge a night especially as that price doesn t even include breakfast given that it is a tech hotel we would have expected the tv to be better quality the picture was blurry the sound was distorted and buzzy and it was difficult to operate the remote buttons weren t very responsive
