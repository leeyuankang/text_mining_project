the bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room the bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor the air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows ok once they were taken out the safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it
