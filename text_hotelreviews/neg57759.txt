the technology was confusing as didn t notice it initially my partner operated it and then in middle of the night i couldnt find a light switch tv technology wasn t working properly either my main gripe is that i made separate bookings for various family members we had difficulty in getting payment made on separate cards and some bookings were billed twice prompt refund made on complaint but worst of all two couples checked in and gave in their cards but were shown to rooms occupied by other people one couple was given a new room fairly quickly but the other couple had to wait over an hour at around midnight after a long tiring day before a room was found for them no compensation offered
