this hotel is trying too hard to reach the stars level but it looked more like a stars hotel i would not rate it more than stars there were a few things which we disliked the bed was very uncomfortable there is an extra mattress put on top of the mattress which is very bad for the back and very wavy we had to remove it in order to sleep the idea of having ipads to control the lights is stupid especially since the ipads are always on at night they are showing the clock and cannot be turned off so again very difficult to sleep with the ipads light next to your head at night
