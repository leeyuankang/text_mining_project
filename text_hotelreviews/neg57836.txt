sadly the technology lets this hotel down they seem to be going through quite a problem with it i ve stayed twice now and it s been a major problem both times tv didn t work properly this time and didn t work at all the last time i stayed had to move rooms because the room controls for lights etc on the panel in the wall didn t work there are no normal light switches the whole room is controlled dependent on wall panel technology and bedside tablets ipads which also suffers from a time lag when you tap it and is not user friendly staff were fantastic in trying to compensate for the inconvenience but there is sadly only so much they can do even the it maintenance guys they outsource the hotels tv and room controls etc and it is this company that needs to be changed sort it out sacked
