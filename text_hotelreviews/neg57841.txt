using the spa with approx people taking constant selfies and photos in the spa area it s quite a small area so we were aware we were in quite a number of their pictures in our swimwear it was really uncomfortable we didn t realise until afterwards that they are banned but despite staff walking through constantly they never told anyone to put them away also i stayed two weeks in a row the first week there was no robes in the room the second quite a lot of the toiletries which had been there the first week weren t there plus we had to wait mins after check in for our room and it still wasn t even ready we had to be allocated a different room
