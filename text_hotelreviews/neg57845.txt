both check in on friday afternoon was pretty chaotic with only people initially on the desks and several concierges asking you questions adding to the confusion suggest more reception staff and fewer concierges saturday morning check out looked dreadful with in multiple queues but the team did move this through well to be fair at the moment the hotel is next to a building site due to excellent double glazing you don t hear much but our room on floor looked almost eye to eye with the crane driver something to be cautious about in the morning
