i normally go to montcalm for relaxation and luxury with great value for money i love to spend time in the spa this time round i took my son i booked via booking com and did not see anything in the comments about spa age limits i have been to montcalm before and seen children in the pool so thought this was not an issue on the first night of our stay my son and i went swimming he is such a good boy aged the next day we went to go and use the spa and i was told he was not allowed to enter when asked his age i told them they told me he was under age this was very disheartening as my main reason for stay is to use the spa facilities my son was upset as he was allowed to use the spa the night before with no questions asked i think the hotel need to be more clear on there spa limitations especially for people who travel to this hotel as families
