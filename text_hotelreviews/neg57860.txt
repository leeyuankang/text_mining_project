the room has a lot of shiny black surfaces that show every mark and fingerprint in general i don t like rooms with lots of shiny black because you can see all the previous guests marks no matter how good housekeeping is at the cleaning job its impossible to get black shiny surfaces perfectly clean the room service was a problem at first with a guy on the phone who was absolutely clueless the room service menu was in transition so things on the menu were no longer offered but the head chef could not have been nicer and corrected the problem pronto very nice guy
