the only thing that wasn t good about my stay was check in somewhere along the line booking com had missed a trick and not shared my booking with the m by montcalm reservations team because of this it took minutes to check in which made me late to the birthday dinner i was attending around the corner also the heating was a bit tricky to get my head around i don t think the under floor heating worked in my room
