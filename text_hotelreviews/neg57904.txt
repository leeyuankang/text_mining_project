for a hotel that charges over per night i was disappointed by several things most importantly the king sized bed had two mattresses both were of exceptionally poor quality but one of them had s massive hole in the middle after my boyfriend and i sat on it to watch tv for minutes and neither of us are big sized people we couldn t use that side of the bed at all and ended up sleeping on the other side we did not have a good night s sleep which was a key reason i had been willing to pay this amount of money in the first place secondly the room had no slippers or dressing gowns i d expect this to be standard for a hotel in this price range lastly the hotel has an elaborate electronic system to control lighting hearing curtains and the tv impressive at first look until you realize that it s very hard to use and it s impossible to get a light or temperature setting that s actually comfortable it would have been far better if this money had been invested in good quality mattresses
