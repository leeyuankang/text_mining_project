on this occasion i decided to drive miles when i arrived rush hour time the parking space had been coned off so i could not stop outside the hotel to unload baggage with no option i had to park in the taxi bay whilst i ran in to concierge when i returned a taxi driver had been blaring his horn at my girlfriend so it was quite a stressful arrival when i called to enquire about the bath butler service i was offered a room with a bath which i accepted but when i arrived in the room the bath wasn t really big enough to really enjoy the bath butler service plus we didn t have the usual amazing walk in shower also we were unable to use the upstairs bar due to a private party i still think its a great hotel but it wasn t as wonderful this time as i know it can be
