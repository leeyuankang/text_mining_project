staff are totally incompetent faulty towers has nothing on this place i endured a catalogue of errors including money taken from my account not once but times the net result was that they totally ruined my birthday the clearly don t care because i m not the first to complain about staff competency i was also less than impressed to be staying at a hotel in london on a saturday and being asked for my last drinks order just before midnight when i questioned why it was so early i was snapped at by the rude little man who frankly was a shade off aggressive i had another stay booked for march but i will be cancelling it
