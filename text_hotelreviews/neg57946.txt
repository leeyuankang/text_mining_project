live in north west london booked for a romantic night close to the action awful check in experience ruined our stay i had asked the hotel to allow my partner to check in as she was arriving before me via booking com unfortunately the gentleman on the desk couldn t help her he said he couldn t see the note fair enough but you have my card and you have me on the phone with the booking number etc it s a one night booking and you have the power to charge the card anyway as you would if i hadn t turned up i rushed from the other side of the city only to find my girlfriend sat in the lobby almost an hour later perhaps the hotel could have given her a tea or somewhere to change for our evening out when i talked to the lady who was now on the desk she was baffled as to why the person my partner had dealt with while i was also available on the phone had not just charged the card on file and let her into the room all together the knock on effect was that i had to conduct my business activities planned for friday afternoon on saturday meaning that we didn t get to enjoy the facilities we missed our evening reservation at a restaurant in hoxton and my treat for my other half was essentially ruined by a lack of competency from the man on the front desk the hotel made absolutely no attempt to try to make things right you will see from my other reviews that i am balanced and fair in my feedback
