however this time the attention i received was very poor the check in took very long i asked for a room with separate beds and they asked to wait for them to prepare the room accordingly they proposed us to go to the spa in the meantime we decided to visit london and at the end of the day when i went to my room i realized that they have done nothing the beds were still not separated i called the reception and they told me that my room didn t allow have separate beds i asked then to change room and they told me that the hotel was full at breakfast the waiter was too distracted i had to constantly call him to bring us the coffee the toasts last time i stayed that was done proactively and the clients didn t have to have their hand raised all the time some of the touch screen on my room don t work which was quite uncomfortable to switch on off lights the spa was not very clean and smelled humidity and the cleaning of my room was also very poor i was recommending this hotel to my work colleagues but definitely i will not recommend this hotel anymore
