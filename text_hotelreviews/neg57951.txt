very poor meal in the restaurant service average at best when we said our meal was just ok due to very tough steak and poor description of the meal we received a blank look no apology the couple on the next table had the same problem as seafood wasn t listed and the customer was allergic food very inferior and over priced compared with some amazing places in london
