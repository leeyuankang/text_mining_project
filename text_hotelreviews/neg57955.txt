the android tablets in the room used to control the lights heating curtains etc i want to put this as a positive feature but sadly they were terrible to use very slow response and kept crashing heating was hard to control would either get too hot or cold and couldn t just choose a temperature and let the room maintain it had to keep changing whether i wanted it heated or cooled every hour or so the tv was very unclear slow to respond and kept crashing every minutes became completely unusable
