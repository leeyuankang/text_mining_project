technology in room was poor lighting was slow to respond to the touch pad which was frustrating the information delivering aspect of the tv led nowhere and as there was no other way of finding out about the spa dining options etc we resorted to googling just give us an in room brochure for god s sake the staff tried hard but lacked training on arrival we were given a room to discover a different name on the room key folder on informing staff this we waited in the room to be told what to do receiving a phone call to say there was a computer glitch luckily we didn t avail ourselves of the facilities as another couple arrived and let themselves in the room shocking for them and us on arriving at the breakfast area we were not offered tea or coffee for ages this happened both mornings despite our full english breakfast being included in the price we paid i was told that if i wanted porridge that would be extra yes i could have had ham cheese pastries as well as cooked breakfast which looked very nice but the only cereals on offer were bran flakes and special k i then waited minutes after asking staff members for a cereal bowl argh confusingly floors above us was another breakfast area for those receiving continental breakfast again not initially explained by staff or room info unfortunately although this hotel has the potential to be great it was not good enough for five stars and we won t return the quest for the perfect london hotel continues
