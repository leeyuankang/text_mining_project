the media station didn t work in our room and nobody came to help us even though we asked times one staff member didn t even seem to know what i was taking about when i told her it was nt working not ideal when it s part of the reason you booked the hotel we also got asked times if we wanted to move to their new hotel in a different location which we didn t and it became annoying being asked i just wanted the room spec to be what it is described as and for things to be working or fixed
