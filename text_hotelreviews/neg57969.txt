this is a personal preference but the bed was so soft it was uncomfortable what really put me out was that everything was controlled by touch pads there were several in the room that glowed at night enough to bother me furthermore these did not work properly when i arrived and were only fixed after calling maintenance who restarted the system twice on my third night the power completely went out only in my room and since i couldn t call down i went downstairs and then couldn t get back in the room since the card reader didn t work either lastly i didn t like paying up front for the entire stay this didn t give me a choice if i wanted to switch hotels or if i was staying with a friend i did book a refundable room
