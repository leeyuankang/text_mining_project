i asked for a drink at the bar was told to sit and my order would be taken i paid for one drink plus another table service the most expensive single drink i have ever had later on in the evening i phoned room service to request an ice bucket about half an hour i called back down to cancel it as it had taken so long on arrival at reception the guy who booked us in wasn t really very friendly he couldn t even bring himself to smile on the website our room apparently had an aroma box which we were able to choose a smell for our room whatever that was but when we asked the guy at the desk he didn t seem to know what we were asking about so we gave up the ipad type controls didn t seem to want to work in our room
