there was a disturbance outside our room at one night due to a guest and staff member arguing about letting the guest into his room i felt this could have been dealt with at reception avoiding the need to argue outside our bedroom door upon mentioning the disturbance when checking out of our hotel the staff member apologised and compensated us an amount for the inconvenience i was very impressed with the way this complaint was dealt with and would have no hesitation recommending this hotel
