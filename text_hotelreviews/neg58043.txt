the only things that let this hotel down is the staff we re rude on arrival and not very helpful tried to call reception four times during our stay because our ipad was not responding but nobody picked up asked about a late check out was happy to pay more but the girl who served us just didn t seem to know anything said we could stay tell but i was concerned so checked with another member of stuff who told us we had to call the next day all very strange to me that such a high rated hotel stuff have such poor knowledge skills and attitude
