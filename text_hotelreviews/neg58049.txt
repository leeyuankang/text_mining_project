i was lied at check in that a deposit would not be charged that only the pre booking on my credit card for the first nights stay would be charged and i paid the balance when i checked in however the hotel had charged the full stay on my credit card as well as blocked another full amount despite the booking being no deposit and me being assured that no deposit would be taken i get charged interest until hotel decides to release the money and it pisses me off that i wasn t told about this otherwise good stay
