we shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed that was fine unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door my wife and i slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light i thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed seemed like a bad layout plan the pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it
