staff is a little bit unresponsive if you try to contact them via email to check if you may have left your sunglasses in the hotel days and counting in addition i left the hotel in a super rush overslept and making a mess including breaking a plate for which i guess i was charged additional charge on my card appeared but again they haven t responded for three days so far so leaves me wondering
