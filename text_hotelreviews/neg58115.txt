the staff messed me around with the booking and payment they mis informed me and wasted my time there was really bad communication between the reception staff during our stay we couldnt work properly because there was no ipod dock or way to play music in our room which was stated on the list of amenities within our room staff were then unable to get us a lead for the tv and unable to locate us a dock or speaker system curtains were full black out but as they didnt fit the window properly light distrubed us early on
