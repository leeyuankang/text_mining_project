the room was slightly smaller than i thought the mattress was too soft really soft the spa didn t have many beds to relax around the pool the shower gel and shampoo were quite masculine but if i had too choose one thing was the vegetarian breakfast if you have the english breakfast the vegetarian is practically everything except the meats there were no vegetarian alternative to those which is a shame as everything else was good
