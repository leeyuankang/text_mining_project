comfy bed requests for higher floor given second visit this year first visit was faultless however this visit disappointing no cold water in spa as both fridges not operating to correct temperature steam room not accessible due to being out of order confusion over breakfast charge attempted to charge twice for breakfast disappointing overall nice stay however one of the reasons for visit to use spa facilities no steam room was very disappointing
