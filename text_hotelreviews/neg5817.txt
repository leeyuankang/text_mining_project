the breakfast was not good taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for at the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice
