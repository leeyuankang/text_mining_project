check in took minutes last time i stayed at a premier inn it took seconds and cost of the price the room was connected via tablets and an android powered interface none of it worked i couldn t have a shower when i arrived because i couldn t turn the bathroom light on an engineer was sent to fix it in the middle of the night it cut out again stopping the aircon and causing me a hot uncomfortable night s sleep there were no instructions on how to use the phone reception didn t answer when i called then when i finally got hold of them they didn t know if they offered a pressing service it s a real shame and somewhat ironic that the flagship hotel of london tech city as they proudly brand their gowns can t provide technology that works to compound it all although admittedly not their fault there is a huge construction site next door and i was awoken at on a saturday by hammering and drilling overall a very disappointing and expensive experience
