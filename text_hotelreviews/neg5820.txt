the staff were all friendly however i was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me i think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing the key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it also most important channels in the tv were not working and there is no looby as far as i noticed also we had a late check in at on the arrival date
