small problems with room key not letting us in i returned about keys by the end of my stay bathroom light in triple room stopped working in night expected as the hotel is so technical and everything controlled by ipad including lights and curtains it was a little strange to have an electrician in the room at to fix the lights but we were given another room while he worked during our issues the staff were very helpful apologetic and professional i requested an upgrade for breakfast for my party and this was granted parking is an issue there was a maximum stay of or hours but it was really expensive the night before was fine as we parked on a sunday but moved the car to a pay and display bay on monday morning next time i wouldn t drive unless saturday to sunday but all of the above would not prevent me from returning i m not sure what standard double rooms are like i imagine they re quite plain as i think we were moved to one when we had the lighting issue my suite was plain but had all i needed so i can imagine a simple double would be even plainer i would recommend a club room as a minimum room as it pays due to the voucher and possibility of a free upgrade one of my favourite hotel stays and i stay in about a year or maybe i was excited for my first girls night away
