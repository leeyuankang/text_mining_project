it s a fun hotel in a hip part of town but doesn t deserve star rating we ve got the last minute deal via booking com the staff was friendly but we clearly caused a lot of problems they were unaware of the late check out for geniuses offer and obviously weren t taking our word for it it wasn t easy to find on the confirmation email but we managed in the end it was the longest check in process we ve ever had we ve cleared the transatlantic security quicker than that they made a copy of my passport an impression of my credit card the room was already paid for then we were asked to fill in the registration form and again for the the credit card and pin to pre authorise any spending on the card the design is great but then they clearly tried to save on builders everything is is assembled rather cheaply bits don t necessarily match and there s glue visible between the parts of the design features the lights in a hallway and in in the club bar are flickering there was a inch gap between blackout curtains and the wall next to the head board so you wake up at with bright light shining onto your face whereas the rest of the room is relatively dark
