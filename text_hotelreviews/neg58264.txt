i was originally given the wrong room to the type i had booked it wouldn t have mattered but i specifically paid more for a twin room rather than a double the staff were quick to respond and move me but also did admit that all they do anyway is separate the beds which takes them about minutes so that s what i paid extra for interesting also there were out of date crisps in our mini bar which in my opinion is totally unacceptable there was also an issue with a pre paid amount for extra drinks and food whilst you are there the bar told me i need to pay as i hadn t made this pre paid arrangement they even rang down to reception who confirmed this as it turned out i had paid and again it was their mistake when i complained about the above issues the guy on reception seemed to find it fairly amusing and smirked not really behaviour or service i m afraid
