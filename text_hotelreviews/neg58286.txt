reservation made via booking com with usual personal details submitted online and secured via the company credit card i was then asked for photographic id during the check in process when the receptionist was questioned on the need for id she was unable to give me a reasoned argument and then suggested that it was just part of the process they had to follow a little concerning given the amount of personal data exchanged by simply checking in to that hotel i was then told that payment was required on arrival as the booking was secured via booking com which was not a problem but i was then informed that i couldn t use my personal card because pre authorisation had already been made via the company card and which was taken prior to me even arriving at the hotel in addition after declining the pre authorisation per night i was abruptly told that i could not use the mini bar my entire experience of the hotel was tainted within of arrival it is disappointing that the hotel cannot replicate their local competitors customer experience perhaps less of a security grilling and more a warm welcome would be more appropriate
