i was greeted by the staff and told to pay for my room upon arrival i do not think i have been asked for payment in advance usually a bill at the end of the stay didn t make it feel very i did not know that i would have to pay an additional charge just in case i decided to eat or drink some items from the bar in my room i told them i did not intend to take anything from the mini bar nor eat at the hotel so therefore i did not want to pay i was then told the mini bar would be emptied and good enough someone came to empty it not very trusting of your guests i wasn t made aware of this when booking the room
