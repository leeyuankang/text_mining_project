the staff let the experience down their english wasn t good enough so i had to repeat myself everytime that i spoke to someone which grew really tiring the food at breakfast was good but the organisation of it was awful staff didn t know who d been seated where spilt coffee over guests and i had to ask for some toast three times one morning with the right staff it could have been a perfect trip
