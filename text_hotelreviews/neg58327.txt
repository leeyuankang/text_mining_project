the curtain was broken in our room and would not close properly i had to ring down for our luggage as this was not in our room we had a full english breakfast included in the price and when we went to the restaurant on sunday morning a lady member of staff told us we had not booked and paid for the breakfast and did we want to wait somewhere quiet i felt very embarrassed in front of everyone one in the restaurant i showed her my booking and she said she still didn t have us booked in everyone else they escorted to a table but not us we did eventually get our breakfast without an apology for the embarrassment they caused us this was a special stay as we were celebrating my husbands birthday i will not be recommending this hotel or staying there again
