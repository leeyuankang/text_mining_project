the staff we had been told when we checked in the hotel that the pool is open from till we made sure we got back to our hotel at so we could have an hour or so in the pool we got in the lift to go downstairs to the pool the lift always stops half way at nearly every stop on the way down as someone else will press the button finally we got the pool and the lady had turned around said oh the last check in was and its now how rude is that minutes i was more than shocked we had recently spent two nights at the shard shangri la hotel the night before and decided we wanted to stay another nights in london so we stupidly chose this place never again we were allowed to go into the shangri la hotel sky pool even minutes before it closes so why the hell did it matter if we were minutes late because of their stupid lifts i complained to the lady all we got offered was a complimentary free drink which we did not want we wanted her to turn around just let us in the pool for minutes the next day we got breakfast room service in our room which was amazing but the second morning we had ordered it took an hour to come then we didn t even get a choice of which toast brown white scrambled egg fried which we got offered the first morning the guy then came into our room with the breakfast had said oh i came in at this morning and i had to make your hot chocolates myself which was no excuse to us and the drinks were cold as an ice drink when we checked out we where then charged for room service but our breakfast was included they had also charged me deposit without even letting me know luckily i checked my bank statement i had to even call up a few days later to make them refund it to me as it took days from going to the shard to this hotel was the worst mistake of my life
