everything is ran off of a tablet which sounds cool but i can assure you it s faster to hit a switch than to tap the screen find the light you want and turn it on the tablets never actually turn off so they are kind of a pain to sleep next to they try to make the rooms smell real good by putting some aroma therapy box but it s real strong and we had to have it removed from the room as it was way to overwhelming with all the technology the room has to offer the tv has no tv guide after a long day touring london we had to flip through every single channel to find what we wanted to watch super annoying
