technology in room didn t always work and was overly complex eg buttons to turn on a bedside lamp breakfast set up made it crowded when trying to get a coffee lifts take ages our booking wasn t registered when we arrived all relatively small things but for a star hotel it didn t feel that special it was fine but more like a star which is disappointing when you want the wow factor
