there s no parking around the hotel the nearest ncp is a minute walk however it s free parking after on back roads and free on sunday s so i guess you could time it right to be closer to the hotel the guy at check in was a bit clueless and i had to help him out i spend a lot it time at hotels for work to speed up the process i also find it bizarre to be in london and people do not understand me while i m speaking english everything else was fantastic
