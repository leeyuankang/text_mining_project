i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization he claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than nights i told him i was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written he said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies i told him i disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments i asked to speak to his manager he said i am the manager then i asked to speak to his superior then he said i will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount i told him this will not work as it will take at least days to reverse the payment he said that he is sure it will take few hours unfortunately he cancelled it and took working days during this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank i was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience
