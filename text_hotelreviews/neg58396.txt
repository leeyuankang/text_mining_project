we stayed at the hotel for two nights our expectations according to the cost level was obvious very high after a day out we came back at and found our room uncleaned we had to spend half an hour in the reception waiting while the room was cleaned we were offered a cup of coffee as compensation day two after a breakfast outside we got back to the room and our key didn t work down to the reception again and listened to i m sorry sir our conclusion is that this hotel don t live up to their description and i vigorously over priced
