most of the staff have very weak english public areas are dirty and sticky room can be cleaned even as late as sometimes they might simply skip your room the hotels address are being printed wrong which for me personally make missing post situations the club room looks more like bistro very unconftable very average in bar there are no offered peanuts all tho for even average five star hotel there should be at least three different types of snacks restorana will charge you even for bred to room service prices they will ad and after that another of bill technology in rooms is braking down every single day so maintenance team in your room wouldn t be anything unusual in bigger picture at the moment it can be rated as average hotel
