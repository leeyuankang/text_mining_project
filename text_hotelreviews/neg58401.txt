was really frustrated on monday evening when we tried to go to the sky bar on the floor for a drink around to be told it was closed when we arrived we were then advised that there were bars on or ground floor then when we went down to the floor bar the staff there advised it was closed and escorted us to the ground floor where we finally got a drink
