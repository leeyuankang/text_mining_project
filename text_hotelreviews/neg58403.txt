all small stuff here but things to take note some of the tech is overkill and has glitches when you just need to simply hit the lights off but this area shoreditch is known for being a tech hub so its understandable what they are trying to do also alarm in spa kept going off because they had i big red button in the steam room that people kept pressing thinking it would create more steam terrible design and i m sure its going to get fixed after the incident construction is taking place next door so depending on the room it can be noisy not the hotels fault but there were some rude snobby guests it seems to attract a crowd that thinks they are much cooler than they really are not really much of a view or open light windows were slivers but that said it didn t seem to intrude on the comfort and feel of the space
