although i love the tech aspect of this hotel i feel like it s a bit overdone and doesn t work as quickly as you d expect based on current tech standards i suspect i wouldn t pay the full price for this hotel though if i d not got a great deal on booking com just my opinion and nothing against the hotel but more about my general guidelines for what i ll pay for hotels
