the breakfast was awful probably the worst i have ever had all buffet style stale greasy sausages old fried eggs with skin on them and cold beans cold beans that takes some doing we couldn t work out if there was or wasn t fresh coffee available and the staff we asked just wafted their hand i eventually found a coffee machine and had a rubbish latte three cereal options were available upon asking where the sugar was on the table it was but as sugar lumps we also couldn t find the toast i would have asked the staff but we had given up by now and they seemed too busy gossiping i can think of no reason to ever have breakfast here think sainsbury s breakfast but far far worse i should add this was at in the morning kind of a normal time for breakfast we stayed on a saturday we arrived back at and the bar was shut that just about sums it up lovely building but clearly the guests are an inconvenience
