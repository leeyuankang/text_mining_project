their full english breakfast doesn t serve a veggie or non pork option which most hotels now do as standard and they won t let you chose anything else that isn t meat based or not pork as a replacement breakfast even where said option is cheaper than a full english breakfast so you end up paying for full english breakfast that you can t eat if you don t eat pork or meat in general i think their age limit for young children in the pool accompanied by an adult is outdated and needs to be looked at my son is a proficient swimmer at years and he was upset when he was refused entry into the pool even though i was with him
