coming back to our room in the afternoon the door was ajar due to housekeeping working nearby they had not quite got to our room was troubling because it was directly opposite the lifts so anyone could have walked in bearing in mind there was highly sensitive material on my husbands work laptop in the room we used the safe after that we spoke to the manager on duty who was extremely apologetic and we were sent a bottle of wine it would probably be better to have a policy of only opening doors when actually in the rooms replacing towels etc
