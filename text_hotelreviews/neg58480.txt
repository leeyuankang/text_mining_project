my experience in the bar was disappointing the breakfast was poor but my main gripe is the noise of doors shutting in other nearby rooms which was very loud and annoying also the water pressure in our bathroom was very poor for a hotel there are definitely some improvements to be made but the price paid it s exceptional value
