as this is a fairly new hotel i think staff were quite disorganised my husband booked the room for me on his card and when i arrived i was told that they would need to take payment from my card for security reasons staff members then knocked on my door three times the next morning to clean the room even though i had the do not disturb sign on my door and had explained to them that i was staying two nights nice hotel and friendly staff but overall very disorganised
