everything would have been perfect if not for the concierge who on my first night there saw me coming in from an evening out at about and chased me down to demand my room number on me showing him my room key he then made up something about a package which he thought might be for me but this was clearly not the case and it made me feel very judged a shame as i really did love this hotel
