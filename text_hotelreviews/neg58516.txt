just a suggestion really used the spa on sunday morning after a post theatre lie in missed breakfast as it finished at would have loved to have had brunch post checkout but only lunch was available there is such a brunch culture in the area i wonder if this would be attractive to both guests and non residents ended up at the shoreditch grind which was lovely but would have preferred to have brunched with you to round off a wonderful stay
