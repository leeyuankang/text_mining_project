i ordered burgers for d kids on saturday as we were meeting my niece and boyfriend for dinner and d kids were hungry and wanted to eat straight away so i asked for plain burgers with nothing only the bun i informed them they were fussy eaters and wanted nothing more i was asked would i like chips and i said i portion of chips i got the burgers with just the bun with loads of salad and garnish on the side and one portion of chips and was charged over pounds for this included in that were two teas i think it was a ridiculous price to be charged for two burgers when i looked at the menu afterwards i guess they gave me the burger on the menu which was each it says on the menu there was a kids menu and the waiters knew they were for kids i think it was a ridiculous price and we didn t eat anymore there after that to me it was a big disappointment
