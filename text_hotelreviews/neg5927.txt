being woken at by a wake up call i did not order being woken ten minutes later by a phone call then the teenagers next door slammed the door numerous times from to until i asked them to stop the manager on duty was not helpful and advised that i was not the only one woken up by the automated wake up call system he advised that at least other guests were also called that did not make me feel better and there was no effort to mitigate my dissatisfaction
