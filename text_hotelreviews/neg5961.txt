called to request early check in and was advised i needed to book an additional night night before to guarantee this was ridiculous as i only wanted to check in an hour or so earlier than the time stated i declined this and turned up at and was told the room wont be ready until i felt this was unreasonable as i offered to pay for early check in as it was my sons birthday which is why we was staying at the hotel we wont be staying again
