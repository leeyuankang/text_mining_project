i paid in advance on arrival and was disappointed that i was not advised that i could not charge our meal to the room would have been better if i had been asked if i wanted the facility to charge to the room although not a major problem the message light on the phone continued flashing all night although there were no messages we couldn t get it to turn off so just moved the phone so it wasn t annoying
