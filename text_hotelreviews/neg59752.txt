the bathroom was small but shower was amazing great pressure however the leg space for the commode was too small narrow we stayed in almost for a child it wasnot comfortable would be nice to have a complimentary bottle of water per guest on but that is a small thing decent selections for breakfast but per person cost of too steep better to have outside many options available around hotel should consider this and also give varied breakfast packages instead of a flat rate for all choices
