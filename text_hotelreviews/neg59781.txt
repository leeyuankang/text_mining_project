i was taking medication and had to rest a lot and my husband could not move easily around the room after placing our luggage in the room after one night we were able to move to a slightly larger room which helped but we were still cramped and had to move to another hotel after that the hotel manager would not allow us to move out after night as i wanted to without having to pay for that night but the hotel staff really tried to help by providing a larger room the second night even just by a few feet i would not stay here again but if space is not a concern it is a nice room in a good area
