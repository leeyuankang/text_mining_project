hotel could put directions on web site telling best route to take to hotel especially if coming from international train station from paris etc once you get on the jubilee line it s a straight shot to kilburn station then catch any bus on the same side of the street as the station and on to the hotel a mile or so this info would have been a big help especially when carrying your luggage
