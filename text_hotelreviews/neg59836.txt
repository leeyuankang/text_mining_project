the service received in the adjoining restaurant crown grill was appalling and i complained to the restaurant manager and the clayton crown hotel check out staff i ordered a course meal and every item served was different to what i ordered for example i ordered a crab salmon soufle starter what arrived was smoked salmon and rocket served on a sourdough bread i ordered a corn fed roast chicken with a green salad and herb garlic sauce main course what arrived was a roast chicken with a cream peppercorn sauce and chopped carrot salad i then ordered a raspberry brulee desert what arrived was a vanilla brulee topped with a strawberry my bill was reduced by which i thought rubbed salt into the wound
