the bath in the ensuite had been fixed near the plug and was sharp there was black mould near the shower which could have been cleaned up better some of the reception staff were not very helpful at check out the food in the clayton crowne bar was expensive and we were a little disappointed with quality of the meals as they were not worth the money the restaurants nearby were much better the breakfast had a good selection but on the first day the cooked breakfast was a little overdone and cold but the second morning was much better i think for what we paid per night it was a little too expensive have stayed in london before in much better value for money hotels
