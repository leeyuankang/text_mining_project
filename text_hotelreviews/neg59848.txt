some reception staff are very inexperienced and rude on check out i advised the receptionist i had already paid for my stay but she continued to put my card details through anyway in the end i was charged twice for my stay i rang the hotel and they assured me they would deal with it promptly it has been a week and still no response my bank was very helpful in dealing with this situation i will not be back to this hotel as it was quite expensive for what it is and the reception staff don t know what they are doing
