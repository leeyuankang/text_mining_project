this is the second time staying at this hotel my partner and i got some bumpy redness on our elbows first time we thought nothing of it as must be a rash but it happens the second time as well i m guessing is from bed bugs we inform the staff the manager came he did apologised for the inconvenience and said will check with the housekeeping didn t write any report on the matter we left it i will not stay there anymore as mentioned that was our second time that it happened
