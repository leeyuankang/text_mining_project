the plug in the wall was broke and it was the only one that i could get my straighteners plug into because of the wire its hard to plug into certain ones so to use the other plugs i had to ask for extension lead the staff were very helpful on the wall of our bedroom the whole room was painted one colour then behind one of the pillows there was a big white mark of paint that had tried to be covered up with the pillow didn t get much daylight through the window on the ground floor and there was a wall very close to our window so we had to rely on the okay lighting inside the signal on the television kept flickering whilst we were watching the television the area isn t amazing but to be honest that didn t really bother me never got chance to use the pool as we were too busy but it looked nice
