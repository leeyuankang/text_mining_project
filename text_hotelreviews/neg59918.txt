room was very noisy because of swimming pool during the entire day additionally parties were held during two of our nights making too much noise we requested change of room so we were moved to a room in another floor away from the swimming pool which was quiet during the day however there was another party although this time there was much less noise in our room i think it is unacceptable for such hotels to allow organize so loud parties after midnight
