it would have been good if the email confirmation had indicated the closest underground stop with instructions from there very easy since you just walk straight down the same road we did not have wifi or phone when we were trying to figure out how to get there from heathrow we asked at the underground they directed us to switch at west hampstead to a national line train that worked but we had to walk between the underground and other train before boarding then wait again over minutes so it would have been much better to do as the hotel instructed us use the kilburn underground station and one of the frequent busses if desired we had the address from the confirmation email but no note of the underground stop we had no phone available either
