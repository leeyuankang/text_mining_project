reception staff not very good with their information and when we mentioned they had given us contradictory information about the pool they told us they didn t the pool is a good size but the dressing rooms only have one shower and a small bench to change really only suitable for two people be sure not to be there during swimming lessons or you will have a long wait for the one shower the food in the bar was not good at all but the bar restaurant manger was excellent at her job
