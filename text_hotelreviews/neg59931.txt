it is a really noisy hotel from the road outside with sirens and loud cars going all night the hotel has a small crane parked outside which was moved loudly at on both the days i stayed this was not good the sockets in the room are not well positioned so i found it really hard to charge my phone and laptop as the sockets are so close to the desk top that the plugs did not fit in
