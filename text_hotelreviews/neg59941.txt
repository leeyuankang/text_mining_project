the restaurant in the basement of the hotel was poor the cooked breakfast was lukewarm as most of the bain maries were not heated the first evening meal i had was slow cooked pork cutlet slow cooked meat should be tender this wasn t though it wasn t tough enough to send back the second night i ordered the gourmet burger and was asked if i wanted it medium or well done i asked for medium expecting from this request a good thick burger between the buns instead it was thin like the frozen patties you get from the supermarket in attempting to cook it medium it ended up under cooked and cold which is food poisoning central in my book the salad inside the burger was also cold i sent it back and when it was explained to me why it was like this i decided not get an alternative meal which was offered but left the restaurant a poster in the pub heralds the opening of a new restaurant in may they certainly need it
