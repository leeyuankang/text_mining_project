when we arrived there was an unpleasant smell in the hotel foyer although we were given a room upgrade the room was very dated and the furniture was tired looking and quite badly scratched the tv didn t work either there was a lot of noise from the street during the night and in the morning there was a fair bit of noise from staff in a room next to ours the menu during the day was very limited and expensive for what it was
