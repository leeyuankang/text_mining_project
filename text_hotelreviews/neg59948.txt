for an establishment which boasts good w fi facilities etc what well i had no wi fi most of the time no outside telephone line and no hot water at times and the remote control only worked on the minus channel mode each time i had to go down to reception in my pj s to sort out these problems most annoying colleagues who tried to reach me were connected to other patrons and my friends were told that i was out of the room i was totally disappointed i was actually considering leaving and finding an alternative place but i had payed upfront at a quid a night for this seriously
