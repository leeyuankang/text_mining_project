slightly disappointed with the swimming pool facilities the changing room was tiny and there were swimming lessons on the saturday afternoon this is ok of course but i chose not to have a swim till the sunday morning rather crowded and noisy also it would have been extra nice to have our own pot of tea and hot water at breakfast rather than waiting for a waitress to serve it however not really that important the breakfast was really good
