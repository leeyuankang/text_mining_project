the only thing wrong with our stay was that we were placed next to the swimming pool and the kids used our corridor as a sprint track which was very noisy we asked the mothers to stop their kids and they didn t listen meaning the nap we wanted after our travel before we went out was impossible maybe more staff on this area would improve the situation
