the room was very noisy as there was music playing until in the morning the heating was noisy so i turned it off and opened the window but lots of noise outside was not asked at any time by staff if i had enjoyed my stay or if there had been any issues went to use the pool on saturday morning to find three quarters of the pool was being used for swimming lessons
