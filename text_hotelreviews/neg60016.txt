breakfast was a waste of time the sign said to wait to be seated we stood waiting for mins before we took it upon ourselves to sit at one of the many available tables it wasn t busy so why did the staff not welcome us or the other two couples waiting it took forever to take our order and then when it came it was wrong it said on the menu that soya milk was available so when i asked for some i was disappointed to be told that there wasn t any the coffee was repugnant you d have to work hard to make coffee that bad i d stay at the hotel again but won t eat there i d rather go to the pub down the road for breakfast for a star hotel you definitely don t get a star breakfast
