the room was at underground floor without windows outside i felt very claustrophobic there the bathroom was dirty and the room was very noisy because was next to the inside pool the breakfast was horrible nothing was tasty and it was very poorly i paid for nights but not worth the money for sure was not my best experience in london and for sure i will never come back
