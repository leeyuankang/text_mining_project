couldn t open my balcony door bed was far to soft and uncomfortable mattress needs replacing breakfast was plentiful but the ingredients were cheap this impacted on the taste which was not good at all eggs tasted powered sausages tasted like they had been cooked the day before bacon had absolutely no flavour cereals tasted old and we re obviously the cheaper brands orange juice was out of a long life carton i m sure it s a shame the hotel obviously try s to save money on the breakfast as this is a guests last memory of the property and it s not good i was not the only guest unhappy with it judging by the guarded whispers heard at the breakfast table
