room was hot and very noisy aircon unit dirty windows looking over pool pool was closed due to maintenance which was really dissapointing frayed carpets on lobby stairs no phone signal in our room we had family rooms over floors would have liked rooms on the same floor our shower head was very low my partner is over ft tall so the water only just covered his shoulders with his head touching the ceiling we were not aware restaurant was closed on a sunday would have been helpful to get told this when we checked in as we could have stayed at wembley to eat nowhere to eat around the hotel but we found a nice family run restaurant called zeytoon down the road
