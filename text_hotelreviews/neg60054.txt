the hotel itself is actually not the nice victorian red brick building in the photos but a modern build attached to the side of it rooms are pretty awkward there were only sockets in the whole apartment and one was so close to the desk you couldn t plug anything into it the area was noisy and despite advice saying you could park nearby all day for this turned out to be untrue the location of the hotel is quite far away from a tube station so the cheaper room price was probably negated by the extra bus tube fares and long stay parking cost breakfasts were also pretty poor
