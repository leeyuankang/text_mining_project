the location is quite a distance from the nearest underground station and the walk between the two is not great when carrying luggage one of the nights there was an extremely loud disco coming from the bar area that we were not made aware would happen despite being told we were in the quiet area of the hotel the music still carried all the way through not what you want after a long day round london
