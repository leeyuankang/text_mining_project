the surrounding area although close to a train station was a little rough at night and not the nicest of places but we encountered no issues over the stay simply didn t feel too safe or welcome in the area at night the tv was a little dated as i couldn t view the guide to see what was on each channel without actually clicking on a channel and waiting for it to load minor issue but a little disappointing when other large budget chains are now offering large smart tvs the room was nice however the paint had cracked around the light switches and plugs etc which could be touched up for such a small cost to the hotel to just make the room feel that bit more premium one of the biggest annoyances of the room were the plug sockets they were either so close to the skirting boards or so close to the desk that any plugs with the cable coming out the bottom couldn t fit into the plug sockets as the hardened part of the cable joining the cable to the plug couldn t bend enough to allow me or my girlfriend to plug any of our stuff in the only exception being a phone charger with the cable coming out the top
