staff were polite but sometimes with rather strange behaviour it was close to the midnight when we asked for a bottle of water my wife opens the door and apparently out of being too polite one of the staff who brought the water walks into the room without an invitation where i m sitting on the bed almost naked he asks us to pay while standing in the middle of the room and when i say i will do that tomorrow during check out he refuses saying sorry this is not possible i try to find coins in my wallet while covering my body with a blanket and really really furious i managed finally to find some coins to pay him but later on i was asking myself what if i didn t we wanted to discuss this matter with the helpdesk the day after but we had to run to catch the flight back home i have travelled all around the world so i can confidently say that this was the most awkward situation that i have ever experienced in a hotel
