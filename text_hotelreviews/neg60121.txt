very ruth and unreliable staff yana and her manager especially never settle to go to their basement rooms which they initially gave us with windows level overlooking to their indoor pool with no fresh air and constant noise loud music and screaming people until from the bar every night of our stay when you have small child it was extremely difficult we were required to check in with receptionist every time when going back to our rooms if not our keys were not working location is in bad neighborhood too far from the city we had to walk over min one way to get to the subway bus will take you forever we asked for hotel private taxi to go to silverstone grand prix he never returned to pick us up in the rain and after waiting for hours we had to look for another way to come back to the hotel about miles away and of course our keys didn t work at so the hotel decides when you could enter your well paid rooms we ll never go back to this place again
