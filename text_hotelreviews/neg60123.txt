finding yourself in a room with one window that overlooks the indoor swimming pool where a large number of children are understandably playing noisily and where there is no mobile phone signal is not what i expect for a business booking then to be advised that there are no alternative rooms but later a different view is given to booking com and i am accused of requesting an upgrade that i had never asked for and when seeking to cancel and get a refund that was refused that wasn t a great experience
