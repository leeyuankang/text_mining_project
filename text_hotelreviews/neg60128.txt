we went into the pub restaurant and a member of bar staff shauna was incredibly blunt and rude with us came across like she really didn t want us being in there and she made us quite uncomfortable having lunch also we had mojito s which we re overly strong no mint leaves and no sugar so we couldn t drink them without it making us feel unwell they also brought them out minutes after we got the food
