our room was situated in the basement our view consisted of the swimming pool which had a kids club saturday morning meaning we couldn t open our curtains for the duration of the stay also we were awoken by the said kids swimming class as the only thing separating us from the pool was a single piece of glass very very noisy after all this stress we couldn t even go swimming because the pool was occupied by the swimming class for the entirety of the monring the location of the hotel is poor its not situated in a nice area of london and it is not central at all took us an exhausting minutes tube and a cab just to reach the hotel after being in central london the surrounding area consist of kabab shops halal meat vendors and iceland
