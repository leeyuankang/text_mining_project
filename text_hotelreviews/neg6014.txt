we ate in the italian restaurant on friday evening our waitress was exceptional but this was were our experience ended the food was truly atrocious my husbands spaghetti bolognese went back twice but was still luke warm my steak was below average and how a kitchen can not cook chips so that they are not rock hard is beyond belief such a shame
