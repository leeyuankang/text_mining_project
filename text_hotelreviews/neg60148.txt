my room had a window onto the swimming pool rather than the outside which made it a bit gloomy my greatest criticism is the lighting especially in the bathroom it was well nigh impossible to find a well lit spot for applying make up etc in my room there was virtually no mobile network coverage meaning i missed phone calls and messages
