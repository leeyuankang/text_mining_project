breakfast was expensive given that no one explained where the buffet was offered us coffee until we asked where to get it i ordered poached salmon eggs and asparagus and was told it would cost more which was ok but what arrived was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs i sent it back as i really wanted poached eggs and asparagus and about minutes later a plate with salmon eggs and pak choi arrived at this stage i just wanted to leave so i ate the eggs and left pretty insulting really i would have preferred them to tell me there wasn t any asparagus than taking me for an idiot
