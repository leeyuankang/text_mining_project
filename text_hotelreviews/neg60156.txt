my major points of contention would be the bathroom and a failure to address a large in length crack in one of the walls when i inspected the bathroom initially everything looked orderly and clean until i checked the shower and tub this was quite a let down for me the tile grout had notable mildew in several places and the shower head was encrusted with dingy calcium deposits this bothered me enough to talk to the staff about it and to their credit someone did come and try to improve the problem with a vinegar cleaning solution which made things a little better but not perfect london is a world class city and all hotels need to make sure that their establishments reflect that prestige in every possible detail right down to the tile grout and shower heads
