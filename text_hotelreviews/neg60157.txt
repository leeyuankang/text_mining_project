i had a cashmere hood sweater that got lost in the room during a days stay when i challenged the staff about this they refused to take responsibility making it look like i made this claim up i did not like that the managed promised to look into it but told me that their staff was trustworthy again initiating that the missing item was something from my imagination they did not offer anything even a free coffee for my discomfort and not even a welcome back we will do everything we can to help
