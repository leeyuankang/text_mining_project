the cofee was a real let down undrinkable bitter this is not a matter of taste or strength it is to do with compromising on the quality of coffee also the most interesting area in the hotel the balcony overlooking the atrium is not accessible unless you are renting the room for a function this is annoying if that view is one reason you have booked
