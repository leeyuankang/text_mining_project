it mentioned in the borchure the restaurant had a childs menu but really it was a choice of the main courses but half price not quite a childs choice of food the service in the restaurant was not as good prawn crackers were forgotten then when asked for them they came with no sauces and had to ask no apology but apart from that it was ok
