although the room was nice there were no windows so no fresh air this meant either having the very noisy air conditioning on all night or trying to sleep in a very hot and stuffy room also duty manager who checked us out on saturday morning not very friendly at all compared to the australian lady checking out the people next to us by no means a bad review just our experience would stay again just perhaps not the same room
