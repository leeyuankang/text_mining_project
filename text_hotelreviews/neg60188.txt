a decent star hotel but it lacked some of the most basic things a toilet brush a minibar plug adaptors were scarce only one soap a very cold room with a bad heater i required an extra heater to warm the room in a star hotel i asked for single beds and i found them together that was hilarious a star hotel that actually offers prices without breakfast sounds more like a low cost airline
