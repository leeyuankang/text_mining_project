room was very noisy room it was an adjoining room and could hear everything from other room mainly their tv no window so felt very stuffy actually overlooked swimming pool so would have to close curtains even in daytime to get privacy ideal room if have kids in adjoining room but horrible for us as a young couple enjoying a night away without children
