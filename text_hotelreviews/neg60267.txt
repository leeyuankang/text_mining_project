the only thing that i didn t like was that our room keys stopped working a few times and i had to go down to reception about times to get them reprogrammed the shower in our room could of been a bit warmer even though they started off hot in the early part of our stay also it would of been perfect if they had a spa there but they do have a small gym don t expect a sea view from any of the windows lol it s a nice modern clean hotel and i would stay again for sure had a great time with the family kids absolutely loved it
