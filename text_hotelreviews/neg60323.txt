hotel was probably lovely years ago we paid for a junior suite and got upgraded to a king suite but all the furniture was tatty and badly scratched marked for the money paid even considering the upgrade it wasnt up to scratch excuse the pun not what you would expect to see in a king suite also we had a lot of bags and i am months pregnant but there was no porter to help us to from the room the receptionist told us to get the luggage trolley and bring all bags in out and up to floor ourselves not great customer service the room was clean but little things like a lot of dust under alarm clock and mould dirt under shower door just weren t what you expect in a decent star hotel
