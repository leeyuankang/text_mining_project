there was never any spaces in the car park we were attending a wedding in the hotel the tables had named places but staff would not make sure that people were sitting in the right place we had nowhere to sit due to incompetence and ended up leaving to have our meal elsewhere there were six of us in the party one of us being the father of the bride we did not return to the wedding reception as the whole thing was farcical
