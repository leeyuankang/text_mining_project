the fact that they charged my card first thing on the day of my arrival when booking com say they will charge you for a no show yet they hit my card on sunday morning even though i wanted to pay with a different card and locked up mu other card the receptionist said it was policy to charge all cards in the am which is unacceptable as some people may want to pay cash not what the morans bewleys would have done
