i stayed in room at checkout reception didn t ask if i had a good stay and i forgot to mention my complaint as i was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open i enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to in the morning i don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel
