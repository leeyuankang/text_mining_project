when i arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about we also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills it s such a shame because the location is excellent
