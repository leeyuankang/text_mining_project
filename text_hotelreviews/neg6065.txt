personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at this morning when i happened to wake just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay i would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room i don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was each we opted to take a minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for each
