a little confusion over the room i booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room this just put the booking in doubt also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after i queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room
