the hotel was not even close to four stars maybe two but only because of the location the accommodations were very cramped they did not supply wash clothes instead they used disposable clothes much like a clorox clean up you walk directly into the bathroom when up enter the room so if you re in the shower the person entering the room will get a show too the coffee cups weren t washed they both had remnants of a prior guest s lipstick on them as did the teaspoons the water in the coffee pot was left for days without the housekeeping service ever looking at it leaving it with a stale smell and film on it the carpets weren t vacuumed nor were the chair cushions ever fluffed or turned the fabric on the chairs dust ruffle and foot blanket were all worn faded and tattered on the edges and the ultimate worst part of the stay if you could stomach the accommodations was the constant jack hammering that persisted from am until everyday with the exception of saturday and sunday which the staff did absolutely nothing about completely disinterested in helping several of the guests dealing with issue and tried to say that moving to another room would be better fyi moving to another room was just as loud as it was in our room and every other room in this hotel we originally tried to cancel our reservation because we had an opportunity to stay in northern france but the contract that we had through booking com would not allow us to do so without losing all the money we paid for the night stay booking com stated that we could ask the hotel for a refund and of course the hotel stated they would keep our prepaid night deposit well now we know why they couldn t get anyone to take the room if they gave them away coupled with the constant jack hammering it was truly one of the most unfortunate situations when you re on holiday to have to stay at this hotel
