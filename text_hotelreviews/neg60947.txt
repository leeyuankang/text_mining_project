we chose this hotel because of the french provincial look of the rooms we were a bit disappointed although knowing the rooms in paris are generally small this room was very small as was the bathroom with the inconvenient placement of the shower and the tub being too high to step into the entire room needed to be refreshed because it was extremely dated unlike the photos on the website the staff at breakfast and maid service was very good however the front desk was not overly welcoming and barely interacted with us which gave us the feeling we were invisible
