pretty much everything except the room this hotel has almost no public areas that are not demised as bar or restaurant so as a guest it is more like an airbnb room than a four star hotel as previously noted the bar manager prides himself on getting the bar cleared early post to set up for breakfast and the non bar areas consisting of plastic covered chairs is more like an nhs waiting room than an hotel the manager reached out to us after my last review but we also saw some american clients informing him that they were canceling all their remaining nights so we are perhaps not alone in our frustration the hotel is next to a pretty public park yet late at night it is quite possible to walk into the hotel and to the rooms without any supervision or interest from the reception staff the lift is currently broken and the hotel s entrance is full of the required replacement machinery and vans in a taxi it is illegal to stop outside the hotel during the day the manager promised us he would turn things around though i am skeptical that this will be the case my advice avoid this place it s too far from any tube station and for this price there are much better hotel options in london
