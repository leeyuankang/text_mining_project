this is better described as a bunch of bedrooms with a reception than a real hotel the public areas consist of a corridor from the reception desk to the bedrooms there is a bar though the staff spend most evenings trying to turf the customers out so they can set it for breakfast complete with cornflake dispensers as early as when we visited it on our first night at we were advised to sit in the corridor as the bar would be closing soon this despite being full at the time the staff are consistently miserable and the reception staff pay little or no attention to guests you could walk in here from the street and get to the rooms pretty much without acknowledgement or challenge to hide the traffic noise the hotel blares out loud music in the entrance from the street which is very noisy and doesn t give a good impression
