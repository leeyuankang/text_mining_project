i was in a ground floor room near the restaurant and opposite the stairs leading to the bar the smell of food and noise from these locations affected my stay in addition the fan outside seemed to switch on every minutes and was quite loud finally there was excessive banging of doors from about all of the above meant i had a less than restful night
