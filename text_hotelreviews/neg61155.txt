one small criticism of what was provided in terms of accommodation and facilities was that the individual portions of milk in the fridge had gone off this seemed a little sloppy for this level of accommodation the mail criticism we had would be over value we got a good deal on the room rate online and because of the night of the week we were staying although breakfast wasn t included and it was also an extra a day to use the facilities at a nearby gym we would have been mortified to have paid what is the apparent full price of the room having said that we live not far from london so don t typically stay overnight in hotels here so we have little to compare it with other than accommodation in other european capital cities we ate in the restaurant too and though the food was lovely again it was expensive and our meal was accompanied by the worst music playlist we ve had the misfortune of listening to over dinner for some time think low rent alexander o neill and lift music versions of mrs robinson
