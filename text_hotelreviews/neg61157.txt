the staff service could have been better some struggled to understand us maybe their english could have been better in one instance we ordered a bottle of wine then changed our minds to something else the waiter went off without saying anything and came back with both bottles and that took minutes and there was only other people in the bar and this wasn t the only time our service was slow not understood also you shouldn t state breakfast included when that s only cereal cold meats and yoghurts anything that needed to be cooked even toast is a charge to me this is bad as it is not clearly advertised
