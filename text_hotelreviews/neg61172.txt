we were given room number which was extremely small and dark and should not be considered a double room in our opinion unfortunately it s also right next to the busy main road so even with secondary glazing the traffic noise is always a problem as it seems to come through the walls it was also right next to the goods entrance which was audible when deliveries arrived two chairs and a table were crammed into the space between the bed and the wall making it difficult to access the bed there were also issues with the bathroom it smelled really badly of damp which permeated the whole room and the bathroom floor flooded when we used the shower after we informed reception of these problems it was repaired which is when we noticed the smell of sewage the bathroom was also constantly freezing as the under floor heating didn t seem to work the hot and cold were the wrong way round on the bathroom tap surprising when forgotten in the middle of the night after two nights we couldn t bear the smell anymore and asked to move room we got room which was much bigger lighter and really quite lovely unfortunately as soon as we returned from town for a nap at around the maintenance crew started drilling right beside our room after minutes we called reception to ask how long it would take were told minutes and after a further minutes of drilling we called again to complain the drilling stopped only to be replaced by hammering we understand that maintenance work needs done but in our opinion loud work should come with a warning to the guests or done in the middle of the day when most people have checked out or are out in town as a pregnant woman and someone who is paying to stay there if i need a nap then i need a nap and i should be able to take one this should not be a problem unfortunately this was not possible so i was exhausted that night and couldn t enjoy the show at the apollo as much as i had hoped
