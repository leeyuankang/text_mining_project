i visited for a special occasion with my elderly mum it was her birthday so picked this hotel specifically for the high standard and facilities unfortunately when we went to have tea on arrival we were told that the lounge and dining room were closed for a private function i was gutted as we had wanted to spend a leisurely afternoon and have early dinner before heading out to theatre i was shown into a basement conference room which was being used for dining but it looked like being at work so didn t stay we had a quick bite in the room lovely and then went to hunt for an alternative to eat not ideal as her mobility is a bit limited and we had thought we were sorted might have opted for a less expensive place with facilities if i had known prior to arrival
