on arrival it took a while in reception to check in after asking twice the room wasn t ready they wanted to upgrade us and give us a special room but i had to ask twice if we could just check in as we had appointments scheduled bit of a hassle the receptionist thought we had all the time in the world but unfortunately we didnt within the room there were too many gadgets the phone had a constant glow on it which flashed all night the fan in the bathroom was humming all night so you could hear it whilst you were trying to sleep not so relaxing apart from this our stay was good
