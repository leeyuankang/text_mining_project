hotel was not as quiet as i expected i had one completely sleepless night because of kids running for most of the night in the room above mine was moved to another less noisy room next day still lots of trafic and other noise rooms and beds are extremely small dirty worn carpets hotel is supposed to be brand new but feels like it already needs renovations the london novotel west which is closeby offers better value for money
