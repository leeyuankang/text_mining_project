i asked the front desk to arrange for a cab to the airport they did not arrange a cab but booked a luxury car whose driver charged more than three times the cost of a cab and then demanded a tip on top of it front desk should have informed me that they were not arranging a cab and that the cost would be absurd i was charged pounds for the short ride to the airport secondly i was unable to use the tv with my hearing assistance device because it has no connection for headphones almost every tv has this connection when the hotel replaces its tvs you should make sure that there is a headphone jack for hearing impaired guests
