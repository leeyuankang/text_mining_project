i don t like having to pay a service charge thats forced on me by the bill in the bar area i always tip anyway we did have our money taken twice for the room but this was explained on our arrival as a party mistake problem was rectified competently on arrival by the duty manager and we were offered a free upgrade and complimentary drink which was nice breakfast was extra and far too expensive even for a london hotel
