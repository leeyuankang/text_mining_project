this hotel is an absolute no go not only are the rooms incomprehensibly small for a hotel but at in the morning we were awoken by construction work strong high pitch drilling noise not on side of the room but on sides it was such a strong drilling noise that i recorded it i can make it available to whomever wants it impossible to sleep to work or basically to stay in the room i called the reception and the guy there told me in a very impolite way that it wasn t his fault and when told that it was not correct to rent such a room he answered that he wasn t supposed to know about the construction work and that i could complain to whomever i wanted it wouldn t change the problem after investigation quickly it appeared that it wasn t the first day of the said construction work so they basically rented the room to us knowingly at a high rate
