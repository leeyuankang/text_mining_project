it always annoyes me to arrive at a hotel and find that i have been mis lead this hotels boasts and a half stars it is a star hotel even by paris standards the room was barely metres the chair could not be pulled out without hitting the bed the bed and pillows had the comfort of an autopsy table everything about this hotel is dark cramped and depressing for nearly a night i had the right to expect much more we got out as soon as possible thanks to booking com and found a beautiful star hotel in the theatre district the contrast was startling if you want to ruin your stay in paris this place is for you otherwise keep looking
