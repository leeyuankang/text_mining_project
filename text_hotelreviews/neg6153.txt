being a club carlson member and having upgraded the room on arrival for an additional total of to include breakfast and a view i would have expected more than a pair of slippers no dressing gowns only three tea bags only two tissues in box in bathroom and a duvet which only just covered the bed on arrival at breakfast we were told we had not pre paid and subsequently seated on a table totally surrounded by other tables guest bags etc so you weren t able to get out without inconveniencing people by asking them to move no explanation of how the buffet worked and no offer to top up tea this is a shame as we have stayed here on a number of occasions previously and experienced fantastic second service
