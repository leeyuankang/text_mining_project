we ordered a double bed we got two separate beds which were sliding apart from each other for a couple that wants to spend its second honeymoon that is a real killer one of us occasionally dropped inbetween the two beds onto the floor view was not that cool were stirring at a wall from another house where we were facing kitchen and bathroom windows including all the sounds the worst thing about this place was the breakfast first morning we went down and the first thing i spotted was dirty forks and knives i thought ok i m gonna take a tissue and clean it myself because all of the forks and knives located in a basket were dirty plates were dirty too all of them but finally and that was the reason that made us leave were the cups prepared on the table dirty crusts from hot chocolate crusts from old coffee really awful short excuse from the guy at the counter that s it wifi slow bad coverage sometimes outages
