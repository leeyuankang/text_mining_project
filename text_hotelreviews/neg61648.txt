although presented beautifully and immaculately clean the rooms unless travelling alone or you are below average size are uncomfortably small from having to inhale and fold shoulders in to sit on the toilet to having to take turns on the small bed to having nowhere to put your luggage enjoyed the stay would recommend the hotel for the right persons solo short or willing to pay for the upscale rooms but for me i d sacrifice a little bit of quality to find a bit bigger room in same area next time
