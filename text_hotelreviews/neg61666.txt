loud at night we were woken up from other guests coming into the hotel and our floor at and multiple nights multiple times walls were thin and didn t feel like hotel was doing much prevent e g posting signs or asking drunk guests to be quiet when they entered suggest specifically requesting a room far from elevators also hotel offered to book us a car to the airport which didn t show up despite us checking twice to confirm they were apologetic and blamed car company but that just shouldn t happen at this high quality a hotel
