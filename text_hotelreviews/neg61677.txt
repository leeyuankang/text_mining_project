breakfast not taken at hotel as seemed overpriced when several of us only have a bowl of fruit or toast one of the rooms i booked was for a family so requested extra bed and discussed it direct with hotel they confirmed extra bed for teenager was possible and that it would be arranged was not advised that it was a camp bed and therefore was not suitable for my niece her father slept on the camp bed but also suffers from aback condition so not very satisfactory we would need to find an alternative hotel who can provide a decent extra bed for future trips bar as guests of the hotel did not expect to find could not get in as had not booked a table friday evening as guests of the hotel did not expect to be asked to leave as our niece aged accompanied us for an after show drink though on asking were advise they could serve us a drink in the reception area suffered a very long delay before someone arrived to take drinks order
