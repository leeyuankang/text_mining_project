someone had left their food in the mini fridge and it hadnt been cleaned out we had to move one of our rooms due to an electrical problem thermostats werent working well bar service very slow despite beautiful setting concierges were pleasant but really didnt know the nearby restaurant scene and certainly were not up on the top rated places for every restaurant question i was met with surprise despite the well known reputations concierge did not get us into any places we had to do it ourselves in the end
