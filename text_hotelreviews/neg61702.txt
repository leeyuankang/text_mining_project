at per night the room was not cheap and so i had thought breakfast would have been included as part of the package it s a shame it wasn t this small detail really let the hotel down for me there is a kettle and coffee machine in the room but no water jug so we had to use bathroom sink to fill both items trying to fit kettle under basin tap was tight and felt a little grubby the sachets of milk were also a let down for such an expensive and supposedly upmarket hotel
