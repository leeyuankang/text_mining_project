the main entrance is reached by a flight of stairs which is not accessible for wheelchairs or baby stroller there is a disable lift on the side of the property but it is usually locked for security reason therefore one need to ring a bell at the bottom of the stairs each time one come to the hotel to ask for an employee to send the lift down and open the side door this is not the best also the superior double rooms are very small we had such rooms and they were all very small
