in the main i think most would be happy with this hotel as is demonstrated by the reviews on this site however that is not to say it is beyond criticism there are still areas that would give many people cause for concern the first is the usual london complaint that rooms are small but at the bloomsbury this manifests itself in a particularly graphic way because space is so limited that you cannot fit anything but a standard british double bed four foot six wide ie one and a half times as wide as a single bed into their standard room i wonder how many couples who can afford to pay a night for a hotel room have a bed that small at home to get what i would call the norm of a british king size bed ie feet wide and slightly longer than a standard double you have to pay for a bigger room at the bloomsbury which necessitates an outlay of nearly per night which i would say is excessive compared to other hotels in major cities around the world there are other areas that fall short of the best too why in a hotel that seems to encourage a feeling of calm elegance do all the bedroom doors have to close like they are being slammed at maximum force believe me if you are in a corridor of people who want to be the first down to breakfast or have to leave early to catch a plane you will be woken up and if by some miracle you manage to sleep through that you may well be disturbed by a hotel operative sliding the big envelope with your bill in it under your door at on the day of your departure why do they do that for heaven s sake they have already swiped your credit card at the time of checking in so you can t exactly do a runner can you in a hotel like this it comes across as rude and pushy not many hotels i know do this sort of thing any more
