the room i paid for and booked for was a superior booked months in advance when i got there i was told it was superior it clearly was not they then admitted it was a small superior room because the hotel was fully booked this was despite as stated booking months in advance in addition the corridor outside my room had circa plastic storage crates in it i advised reception but they never got moved when i raised the issue of the room i was advised that if i checked in again i would get an upgrade when i confirmed i never would visit again and asked for a refund this part via e mail on the difference between superior and standard i still await a response i also found the check in perfunctory took my payment details gave me the room key telling me i had a superior room but no introduction to the hotel or its facilities not even where the lifts where i had to ask the concierge to tell me all this
