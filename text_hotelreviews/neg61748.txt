it s just a small detail but we went for a drink in the new bar of the hotel and the staff was friendly but we felt a bit pushed towards consuming more there it is wonderful that they come over to the table to talk ask about where we are from etc but we were asked by members of the staff if we wanted to eat aswel or have more drinks we only were there for minutes and just wanted to relax and have one drink
