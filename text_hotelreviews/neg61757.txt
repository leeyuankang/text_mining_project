single beds pushed together is not a king the advert stated king bed so mis selling issue perhaps but a lot of hotels do it later check out option would be nice per night the room didn t match the cost although room is a brilliant suite with huge bathroom with large windows and a stand alone bath stayed previously many times unfortunately the suite floor that i was assigned has a very small and quite grim bathroom a very small dark dull lobby is such a great room all in all a rather uneventful disappointing stay maybe time to look elsewhere
