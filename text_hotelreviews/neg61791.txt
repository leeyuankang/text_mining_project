i upgraded to a superior room but discovered excrement in my toilet and cause to complain which was dealt with effectively and efficiently however what i was most annoyed with is that on the morning of my departure my wife an i were woken before by a male who appeared to constantly in and out of room and was performing some kind of meet and greet on the landing adjacent to his room this individual was extremely loud and was constantly whistling and using his mobile phone he had no thought or concern for other guests like me who had purposely used the weekend as a get away break from the usual rat race routine and to enjoy a well deserved break i most certainly did not anticipate or expect to be woken by anyone else and let alone before once again i had cause to complain about this further aspect of my stay and as a result i have been reassured by management of a reduction on any future stay what i would have considered a more appropriate resolution and a gesture of goodwill would have been a refund of some of the funds that i had already paid for my weekend experience
