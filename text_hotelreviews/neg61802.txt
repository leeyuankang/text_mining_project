full english breakfast extremely disappointing eggs like rubber on a bed of grease and i didn t order well done black pudding dry as shoe leather mushroom oozing grease and the rest not much better when in england one expects the full english breakfast to have been mastered it s unacceptable otherwise shame on you wish i had the buffet breakfast instead
