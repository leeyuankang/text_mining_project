we booked a delux room there was nothing delux about it the bed sunk into the middle and was only an arms length away from the bathroom door our room was over the restaurant and by the street so not only did the lights that illuminate the building fill our room to the point we may as well have left the lights but we heard every bus garbage truck and drunk on that street all night long we were also right by the cleaners cupboard which was being used all night but that s just to name a few things that we didn t like or that were wrong the reason we were so disappointed is we compare this to our last stay when we had an amazing and spacious room with a huge bathroom complete with a grand bathtub we were in complete darkness and the bed was like a cloud so we came away feeling refreshed and happy this timewe were both exhausted and really annoyed that we had spent all that money and would have been better off elsewhere or at home
