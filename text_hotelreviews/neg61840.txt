unfortunately our shower was not working properly the temperature could not be regulated properly we complained each morning but it didn t get fixed during our stay although they said that they would send someone up to repair it last day shower turned really hot and i didn t manage to bring the temperature down we thought this was unacceptable for a hotel at this price
