staff were terrible on check in we arrived late and last minute so booked on bookings com beforehand when we arrived they said their system hadn t updated and we were then treated like an inconvenience despite showing booking references and confirmations one receptionist even pulled faces and thought it was funny more training of late night reception staff interestingly the trainee receptionist was actually the most personable of them all
