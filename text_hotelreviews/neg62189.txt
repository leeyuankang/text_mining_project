let s get back to the spa experience i really had the worst pedicure manicure experience in my life the lady was not skilled at all she went far to deep and even the bleeding yes fingers were bleeding didn t stop her from scratching with her instruments deep into the flesh she reacted even angry when i told her to be more careful lol even days later fingers are still infected the late check out policy is interesting i had a massage shortly before my checkout i asked for a late check out and they offered me one hour a high price hotel more than for nights including extras i paid almost should be able to be more generous offering me only the time i spend at the massage was rather outragous a newly opened hotel should always try to make the new guests regular guests but not with this policy
