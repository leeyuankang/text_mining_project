we booked a room with a view online when we got to the hotel the receptionist told us they upgraded us to an executive room i thought wow great bigger room and a view apparently that was just a trick and they gave us a really small room facing a wall the tub drain in our bathroom wouldn t drain after i took a shower i was up to my ankles in dirty water when i called the reception to fix it they told me the technician won t come till tomorrow so my brother had to take towels and shampoo from our room and go shower in another room way down on the ground floor next to the reception that was unacceptable the breakfast is less than mediocre and it was always empty after even though they serve breakfast until on weekends and holidays we didn t get to eat a decent breakfast our whole stay the last day was better because there were french girls serving breakfast but the days before the buffet was empty and we had to ask for eggs and bacon the breakfast room was so small we and other people had to wait for min to get a table to sit at and have breakfast in short less than stars masquerading as stars and way too overpriced
