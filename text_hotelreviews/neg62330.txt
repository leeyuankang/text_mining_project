i didn t get the laundry and dry cleaning service i was promised as it was closed and this was on a monday i had a rude staff member who insisted that the wifi in the second room was not working because of my laptop and not because of a hotel issue i went out on the street to demonstrate my laptop was fine and had instant wifi as soon as i did except for that one staff member all of the staff members were amazingly helpful and friendly i made a complaint about the dry cleaning service which was replied to after i had left the hotel not during my stay i could have made other arrangements as for me this was urgent and i was promised ahead of my stay
