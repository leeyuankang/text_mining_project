spent nights and had different rooms for each day first day the bathroom was flooded never seen that type of bathroom in any hotel second day no air conditioning and it was very hot especially my niece could not sleep at all and the last room was the best just wandered why we were not allocated the last room in the first instance our room was not ready at the first day very disappointing
