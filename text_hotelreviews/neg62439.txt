the standard of service has fallen since my last stay two years ago no response to my complaints for over two days on intermitent interupted tv news service also though cnn was listed as a news channel some other tv channel was shown comlaint to management which blamed tv service provider but after days when i checked out on march the problem was not rectified re checked in again on march same problems persisted in this electronic age i cannot accept that a marriot hotel is indiffernt to guests complaints on its tv news service
