arrived late and tired and surprised by the size of our room we had to stack our suitcases in front of the door so we could move around the bed did not even seem a double on checking our booking the next morning discovered we had not been given a king superior room duty manager offered lunch and drinks to compensate but only had time for a drink so a small financial compensation was given not a good start to our trip
