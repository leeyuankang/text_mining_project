the food at dinner was not great my husband s birthday burger had an over toasted bun to the point that it crumbled at the first touch of a knife and the chips would have been lovely if the kitchen staff hadn t mistaken sugar for salt although it was a possible attempt at a new trend in chip vogue sugary chips were not to our taste my fish was edible but the special batter was somewhat tasteless all in all not a great birthday meal for my husband but the service was friendly nonetheless
