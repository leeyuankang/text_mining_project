the breakfast was very disappointing i feel the food was off poor quality and for the cost of this hotel i would expect a proper buffet breakfast or full english not three little hot lockers all the utensils for these were also mixed up which made my partner feel very uncomfortable as she is a vegetarian and wasn t sure what had been used for handling meat the breakfast area was also very small with everyone being cramped up and struggling to move about we also found some of the staff to be very unpolite when we first go t to the hotel we were made to wait for before being helped and whitenessed some very rude staff
