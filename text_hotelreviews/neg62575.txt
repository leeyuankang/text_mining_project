the room is called a standard queen if you read the fine print this means a bed can vary from cm to cm in fact ours was barely and we were given the smallest room on the entire floor for the cost despite being in london it was just far too small and the bed was no bigger than a n american double bed finally be very careful about billing i checked my visa bill immediately on return and discovered that i was double billed once for the day i arrived when they are only supposed to take an imprint and again on the day i left i have written to the hotel to have one of those charges credited to my account
