was with my daughter and at first given a twin in the basement was told it had a window but not so a door that opened to face a wall and aircon units was dark and gloomy and hardly fun for me and my daughter we asked to be changed and the second room which only had a double bed not ideal was really small and also noisy with an aircon unit the shower screen kept coming out of its hinges and generally not the best it was a last sorta minute deal but should not have been substandard because of it
