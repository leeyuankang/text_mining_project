i didn t like the fact that the ac seemed to be controlled centrally i was too hot on the first night with no ac and wasn t really able to control it on night two even though there was a wall unit although i liked the room very much the gap at the side of the bed was a bit tight for an executive room i felt it was a little overpriced however i probably would stay again
