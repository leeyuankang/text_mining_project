it was so hot in our upper room we paid extra for a duplex that none of us could sleep up there the bathroom which was upstairs was like a sauna without any bath or shower turned on we complained several times but were not given another room or a discount we only used half of the room downstairs with a family of sleeping together on a pullout couch bed since it was too hot to sleep upstairs one of my sons even slept on the floor it made our experience very uncomfortable and no one at the front desk cared i called many times stopped by asking for a room change so upset i was crying do not stay here if it s hot weather in paris because although they advertise air conditioning it does not work
