we are frequent world travelers use to excellent services provided by esteemed hotels as california hotel yet we were very disappointed that when we informed them that we had chosen their hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary they didn t offer us any complimentary services as other hotels they listed charges to every service we could chose to pay for i think a small jest from the hotel could have gone a long way
