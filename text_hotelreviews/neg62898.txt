the check in staff were very close to being rude no charm at all felt like we were treated as a nuisance rather than valued guest kept waiting for mins even though it was and we had been advised by booking com we could check in early likewise check out was equally poor asked if we could check out late as advised by booking com we could subject to availablity when we requested this were told no message had been received fair enough but the answer was still no until later i showed my booking com email and then they said yes and we should have showed the email which made me feel they simply didn t believe me the first time i asked bottom line is for a hotel i feel we were poorly treated a pity as check in day was my birthday and not even good wishes were forthcoming will find another hotel next time
