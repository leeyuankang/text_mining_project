hotel took euro off our credit card at the beginning of our stay as an imprint but it physically left our credit card at the end of our stay the hotel has charged us our full bill again instead of using the imprint money meaning we have effectively paid for the hotel twice days and counting after we have checked out and we are still waiting for the euro imprint to be put back on our credit card
