initially we were booked into a room on the floor location wasn t great on the roof next to the aircon then when we entered the room with our keycard the previous occupant hadn t checked out yet suitcases bed unmade etc pretty bad show reception handled it well they apologised profusely and then gave us a free upgrade and a member of staff accompanied us to check the new room no further problems but that initial error was a bad one
