breakfast was not included and costed euro i went for the a la carte option thinking to save a bit on this but should have thought again i agreed with the hostess i d tell her what i d get from the buffet and she d calculate it for me so i ordered fried eggs for euro and took a coffee and slices of bread for the latter she charged me hold on to your seats euros she told me she couldn t charge me differently as she could only charge me for a full bread so i had to pay euro for tiny slices of bread all together it was euros so the next morning i was a clever boy again and just went for the full buffet for euro what a scam though even in paris
