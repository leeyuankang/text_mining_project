the room is quite small for the price paid and it was also very dusty the buffet breakfast was terrible i would not recommend it for the price we paid per person i also was not happy on arrival they charged us an additional on top of the price of our room as a holding fee for any facilities that we may have used during our time spent there this was not notified to us prior to our arrival on checkout i was told this money would immediately be refunded and in my account within the next hour three days later i am still waiting for the refund we also ate dinner here one of the evenings it was very basic not great at all
