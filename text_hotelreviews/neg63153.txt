the rooms were quite small with the toilet separate from the sink the hotel was definitely not a star hotel it was more of a rennovated to star hotel there are very few restaurants in the neighborhood and this would be a better business neighborhood than leisure spot housekeeping was spotty some days the rooms were cleaned really well some days they were only half cleaned breakfast was what you would expect in a star hotel staff was helpful but had limited knowledge of the facilities or the area there is no concierge and some of the desk staff have spotty english so make sure you are only asking for basic things like a taxi or to check in or out etc although the rooms are recently renovated they are already starting to show wear and tear our room had stains on the sofa carpet and chairs etc
