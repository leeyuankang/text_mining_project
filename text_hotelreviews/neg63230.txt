we enjoyed our stay so much we hardly want to criticise but if were to offer any suggestions for improvement there was no extractor fan in the bathroom although the window did open and the bathroom window was not quite fully frosted having a clear border of a few centimetres all around the edge which was a little disconcerting in terms of the staff everyone was extremely friendly helpful and keen to please we just found that one of the older ladies who delivered the breakfast from room service came across a little too instructive rather than suggestive in terms of her comments so although not at all unpleasant her manner caused a slightly prickly reaction which could perhaps have been avoided this is being super critical though so don t let that deter you from staying in the best hotel we have ever experienced
