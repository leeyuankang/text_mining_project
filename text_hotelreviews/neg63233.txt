i booked this room as a one night transit for my parents who are both in their they had to fill a gap in their itineray so weren t going to stay long in any case if they had they would have moved the room they were allocated was terrible firstly the lift only went to the floor below and there were steep stairs up to their room which they found hard to climb secondly the room itself was tiny thirdly the bathroom was so small as to be almost unusable incredibly the toilet seat was a kids size apparently so the door clould just fit around it and the door to the shower was partially blocked by the other small fixtures in the tiny bathroom this hotel markets itself as an upmarket boutique luxury hotel it is anything but my parents did not cause a fuss as they were out again the next morning but considering the star billing and prices it left a very bad taste in the mouth a ripoff be warned
