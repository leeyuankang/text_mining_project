i had a single room and it was really small especially the bathroom later in the trip i stayed at a different hotel a little further out of the city in kingston and got a double room easily twice as big for half the money and just as nice it s a little more complex to get into city from kingston but i ll take that effort to save a night so to me the value for money wasn t great in fairness the common areas were very nice so the best strategy is to use them until it s time to go to sleep
