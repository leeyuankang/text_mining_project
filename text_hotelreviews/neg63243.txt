as a year old who travels frequently i have never experienced such dreadful service in any hotel or restaurant absolutely shocking mistake after mistake orders not taken then a huge delay before returning to advise half the courses not available drinks order only partly served starter course missing part of main missing and in each case it took an age to get sorted with a waiter who was unfit for the job in every respect apart from appearance ruined a well planned evening and stay and this is an expensive establishment promising much but failing to deliver
