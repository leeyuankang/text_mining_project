i found drinks totally overpriced min for qla g t for a green tea which is usually available for free in most hotels etc diner menu was not overly inspired and also very expensive for the quality baby food options were very limited only the home made chicken nuggets were really worth it very few healthy baby friendly alternatives also we ended up in the lower ground floor without being told which was a very bad surprise for a so called deluxe room at a night
