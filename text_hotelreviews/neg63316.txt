i booked two rooms as there were four of us one was small but perfect with a little balcony the other was too small for two people in my opinion and overlooked some pipes the safe stopped working and as soon as we told them they came to open it at the same time i asked if there was another room with a balcony we were immediately upgraded to a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and more reasonable bathroom
