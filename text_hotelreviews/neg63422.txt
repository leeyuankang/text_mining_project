eventhough stated very clearly in our reservation we have not been allocated to the big frontal rooms even the staff has promised to change our rooms in the second day they not changed our rooms for days also for consecutive times in two nights there were fire alarms going off and no reason what so ever was told us the management of the situation was awful and unprofessional the rooms are really small and not useful the breakfast is expensive overall we have not been happy at all with our stay i will not stay in this hotel anymore
