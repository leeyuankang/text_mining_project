room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards you can hear it clearly every time someone uses it definitely ask for a room away from one there is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard the pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable
