even though hotel is located min from the main train station i was highly diasappointed with the area i know it s not their fault but the smell of urine outside was unbelievable needed to block ours noses what s more on a way back to the hotel late in the evening we did not feel safe due to a number of dodgy people on the street trying to get our attention thus the hotel itself is nice however once you step outside of it this feeling changes automatically another thing the rooms are a bit overpriced for the standard they offer they are very tiny with dirty walls
