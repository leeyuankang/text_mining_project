room was dusty had a courtyard facing room which i expect would be noisy in summer if you wanted the window open there was a persistent knocking noise in the room like someone putting a cup down on a wooden surface thought it was a noisy neighbour but it didn t stop for two days it wasn t constant just enough to be annoying
