id asked specifically for a quiet room and the room i was given was on the floor but not only could you hear all the traffic noise from the street as well as people talking at street level there was a locked door to an adjoining room through which i could hear the man in the next room sneezing and clearing his throat there was also a broken floor tile and one light in the bathroom not working id initially asked very politely just after going into the room if i could move to a quieter room but was told no because i had used the soap and there was no housekeeping staff around later on when i was trying to et to sleep before a full day o meetings that next day the noise was just too much so i called reception and explained how shocked i was at the level of noise considering the price of the room etc and they then agreed to move me to another room facing the inner courtyard which was quieter
