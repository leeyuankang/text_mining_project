we had a room at the rear where a small time welder might cause a bit of noise in the summer with the window open the front overlooks the main road with similar issues no problem of course if the ac works but ours was a little temperamental the wifi on the top floor did drop if not used continually but revived immediately on re logging on we could have done with a set of drawers for clothes for which there would have been plenty of space in the room
