the door to our bathroom became stuck closed with all of our toiletries locked inside unfortunately this happened at midnight with only the night porter available he was unable to fix it he made available the bathroom in another room on another floor which was all he could do but not great to have to get dressed and get in the lift just to use the bathroom in the morning jan was able to open the door and all was sorted by way of compensation we were given free breakfasts for our party
