our reservation of adjoining rooms was done via booking com on arrival the staff had made an error by allocating just one they then gave us two separate rooms which with children was rather stressful as we had to split up to have some peace of mind for the first night s stay the manager was apologetic and did offer the children s of them a complimentary breakfast which i felt was really a cop out as we had to then pay for full breakfasts in order to redeem the hotel itself seems far larger in photographs the lifts are minuscule but then again european hotels are known to be smaller and have a very different take on star ratings the surrounding area leaves much to be desired especially as we were travelling with children it was really busy constant traffic bustling sirens blaring and streets teeming with a varied mix of people overall the area could be classed as rather rough it was also difficult to prevent the children peering out of hotel windows with a street view of shops of an adult nature or even being rather curious whenever we left from or returned to the hotel
