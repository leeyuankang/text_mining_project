the staff were not at all welcoming i would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers the double bed i selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that so cheap such a bad sleep there were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where i saw mice on two occasions during my stay the room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower totally careless i asked for a non smoking room but the room i got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet so bad i want a full refund
