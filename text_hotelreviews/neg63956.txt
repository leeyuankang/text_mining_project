parking was horrible the parking garage is very narrow and we drove in and out again when noticng it was full near the entrance of the garage there were members of staff walking around who did not inform anyone at least other cars behind us drove in and back out again then i walked up to ask where else we could park in the area and were told to just check out all the side streets and park there then we drove around to find out that all parking there is for residents only after minutes or so when then parked at the westferry circus garage which is a minute walk away since the garage did not mention maximum duration of parking we on the hotel itself the furnishings are a little outdated the carpets on the stairs for instance are quite worn wifi did not work there was a card in the room with details but the network could not be found on either of the phones we had with the room itself was nice and clean beware of the shower water pressure is very good but the screen in front of the bath is fairly small so if you do not twist the shower head to the wall for an inch or so the whole bathroom will get wet the head is fixed to the wall and people over approx m will not be able to stand under without squatting a little if i would have paid full price for this hotel frankly i would have been very disappointed comparing to some and star hotels in london i have visited this hotel is more a than a star based on room comfort staff and parking
