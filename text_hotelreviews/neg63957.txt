every part of this stay was horrendous from start to finish when we arrived the sockets did not work so could not charge our phones before heading out for dinner the room was dirty i woke up in the morning to the bathroom flooded water had come all the way out to the room wetting bags shoes toiletry bags etc could not get reception on phone for ages nobody came to clean the mess could not get hold of a gm breakfast was awful dry toast was all we could stomach eating as place was so dirty needless to say we are in process of looking for a full refund from the hotel
