the rooms did not look like the ones on the picture i had to change rooms because the first one was not what i expected booked two single beds however the beds were only one armlength apart the closet door was broken whn i asked the receptionist about the room on the pictures displayed on booking com i was told that those rooms do not exist staff was friendly enough to over us a different room which was okay the furnishing was really outdated i was shocked that this is supposed to be a four star hotel there was no air conditioning in the room while it was only c outside the roomtemperature was around c turning on the air ventilation was in vain and also incredibly loud
