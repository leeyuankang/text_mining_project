the angle of the tv was a bit annoying it was postioned facing away from the bed which i thought to be very strange the bathroom floor was quite slippy i nearly slipped and died the room was so hot too the air con just didn t do it any justice we couldn t feel it at all due to the old fashioned theme of the hotel i believe they could probably upgrade the air con and possibly modernise it a bit more the armchairs though comfortable did have a huge rip down the back of it which i thought was a bit crude considering the location and the amount of visitors they must have
