we couldn t stay all night as parking was full and there wasn t any parking nearby a quick call to reception for advise was unhelpful as they advised it was unsafe to park anywhere else the hotel parking on its own did not seem too secure either there is no access from the parking levels straight into the hotel pedestrians have to walk up and down the same way as cars go which is risky and a tad inconvenient too
