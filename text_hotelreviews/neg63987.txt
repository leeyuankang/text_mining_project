extremely disappointing no free internet in room and you have to pay for every device you want connected once per day the breakfast buffet was not good for example the yogurt had the consistency of water the room itself had cracked yellow water stained drywall or plaster ceiling sink didn t drain a c somewhat worked but the vent was almost plugged with dust they staff was definitely not very friendly but did their job adequately you ll survive a stay here but you aren t likely to particularly enjoy it i ve stayed at many roadside motels over the years that were cleaner nicer and a way way better value this is not a star hotel experience if you arrive with the mindset that it s a place to sleep and won t be eating there won t need internet won t spend any time in your room and don t sweat small stuff like a sink that won t drain it will be okay otherwise probably try somewhere else
