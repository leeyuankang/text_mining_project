the rooms aircon was noisy and not very effective the view was a aircon unit upon a roof and the whole experience made me feel i was back in the s we stopped there as i was attending a conference at the excell centre and when i typed in hotels close to the docklands it bought this one up it was close to the other side of the docklands which then still cost us in a cab to reach shame as booking com have let themselves down with this hotel
