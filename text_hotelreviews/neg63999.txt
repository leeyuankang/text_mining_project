the staffs who were there in the morning don t use words called thank you and sorry we couldn t have breakfast because there was a very long queue when we requested for a refund for the breakfast the lady at the check out counter gave us a rude look and said non refundable a polite word would do the magic the food at the indian restaurant was not up to the mark
