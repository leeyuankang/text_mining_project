i know i booked a budget room but i didn t realize rooms without windows even existed anymore but that s what i got nor did it have air conditioning just a fan the daytime temperatures were about degrees so i had two uncomfortable nights had i known all this in advance i probably would have paid more for something better or an airbnb i actually dreamed about being on holiday in north korea it was that good my other gripe was the length of time it took to get a beer short queues at the bar took forever to get to the front of mainly because people were buying huge rounds of drinks the bar girl did her best but the odds were stacked against her more bar staff might be an idea plenty of people without my determination and unquenchable thirst gave up and i don t blame them my third and final gripe is the external camouflage of the hotel which is labelled the p hotel outside with no obvious clue as to its claimed name of britannia international for a non london dweller like me simple things like this matter quite a lot when i am hot and tired and lost
