my experience with this hotel was quite bad as follows when we had arrived we were not greeted at the entrance by any concierge or bellboy and left to us to take our luggage into the hotel ourselves but once we got to the front desk i began speaking to one of the staff and was rudely interrupted by another most likely more senior staff who insisted on assisting with my check in once all of the particulars were given it was time to speak about the payment even though i had already made the booking and payment through booking com what annoyed me tremendously is the way in which i was spoken to it seems many hotels in london have staff with attitude problems where they speak to guests as if they cannot afford the stay so to speak quite infuriating and pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the stay the bed was ridiculously small for people if you make a half turn from the centre of the bed you are already at the edge of the bed good luck if you toss and turn during sleep don t be surprised to find yourself waking up on the floor the room looked tired and unattractive the carpets were frayed inside the room and in the corridor and all of the furniture in the room was worn and tired i approached the front desk requesting assistance in organising a chauffeured ride to heathrow airport and instead of assisting me the front desk staff just told me to speak to the concierge nothing wrong with that but the problem in this case was that there was no human being at the concierge desk which was right across on the right hand side of the staff member all she had to do was look to the right and she would have seen there was no one there in any case i walked across waiting minutes for someone to come but no one appeared which was quite disturbing i just gave up in the end and used an online booking service instead
