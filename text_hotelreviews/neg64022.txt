the whole hotel is very tired old fashioned and over furnished the air con only put out degree heat so it was really difficult to get the room cool the view was good but there is a building going up right next door so that view of the water isn t going to last long there is a reason why its cheap in the area but if its value for location rather than pretty surroundings you re looking for this is it
