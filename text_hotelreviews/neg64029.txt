got what i thought was a special offer price that seemed more like a price for substandard experience hard to find the room corridors like a warren with paper signs that were worn and grubby no porter and a dismissive point from the concierge to get a trolley ourselves once maneuvered onto correct floor had to get two very heavy cases and two smaller up stairs then get them through the maze of corridors that were semi blocked with maids trolleys the hotel felt more like a hostel with crowds of youngsters congregating in the lobby for coaches then in the evening slouched over the sofas some asleep every morning we were woken early by loud shouting down the corridors from what appeared to possibly be construction workers most awful hotel experience i ve ever had which constrasted greatly with that when this hotel first opened staff were also unwelcoming would never stay there again
