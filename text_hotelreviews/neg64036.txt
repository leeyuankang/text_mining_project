ac was bit noisy but worked well there s a min complimentary wifi available in the lobby and i was able to connect to that from my fourth floor room as well but if you need a faster connection for work and use it costs seven pounds per day in these times when free fast wifi is everywhere i would highly recommend the hotel management to consider wifi revamp
