i arrived around and the reception staff were being helpful sorting out people whose rooms didn t have aircon and a group with a billing question but it meant i had to wait minutes to check in there were other staff in the office who i felt should have noticed there was a queue and come out to help both single beds in the room were very basic narrow beds which looked and felt rather temporary the bed was comfortable enough but it seemed a bit cheeky for the price that plus getting only minutes free wifi made it feel slightly over priced
