the air con in our room was broken on the hottest day of the year we were unable to open the windows fans were provided but they only succeeded in pushing hot air around the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work at all and we ended up sleeping with the door open as the air con was working in the corridors i don t think we would stay again
