i booked the room through booking com but when we arrived the lady at the front desk said for the price i paid on this site we d have a room with no windows they offered an upgrade to a superior double room with king size bed on the top floor for the only truth in the upgrade was the top floor bit the bed was smaller than a standard double there were flies in the room and was not superior to anything i spoke to the manager about the problems and he offered a room change we d already unpacked and got as settled as we could so all i wanted was the upgrade money back that didn t happen the breakfast the next morning was not worth the each the bacon was like cardboard the eggs didn t taste right and the whole breakfast was a huge let down so the price started on here as i ended up paying which included parking the upgrade and breakfast for not impressed with any of it a premier inn would have been the better option
