the bar seemed to close very early on the saturday night which was a bit of a pity we were given minuted to get our last orders in and when i got up minutes late to order our drinks we were told the time was up and the barman closed a rail in my face we then spoke to the barman who agreed to serve us our last drinks as there were a few people also in our predicament however it did put a sour taste in our mouths as it was our first night there and the following night we went to another pub instead
