the room was unclean i booked a double room but was apparently upgraded to a suite which had single beds pushed together the room temperature would not drop below degrees no water in the room which i find in this day and age and at the cost we paid was unacceptable the room was in need of a refurbishment the shower was either red hot or freezing cold the windows in the downstairs bar were absolutely filthy the air con also didn t work anywhere on the ground floor the furniture in the downstairs bar and foyer area need replacing as it had pieces of tape holding splits in the leather together the staff behind reception were grumpy and were not helpful at all the staff in breakfast were all young children and were lacking leadership and needed to be motivated there were many tables uncleaned with the previous persons plates still sat there the presentation of the food looked rushed and was chucked in dishes to try and keep up with the masses of people queuing to get into breakfast i actually went in for breakfast early prior to going for a meeting and was waiting so long i had to leave as i would have been late for my meeting the staff in the bar were actually very nice and did there best for us
