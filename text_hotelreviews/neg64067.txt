my son s room was a poky little corner room with now windows no air single bed and no room to swing a cat the rooms were old and furniture was very poor quality our bed had an old wooden frame the check in took ages it cost per room the breakfast was very poor quality greasy food and little selection when we tried to speak to someone about the rooms and other complaints we were fobbed off by saying we needed to complete an online form we won t be staying again premier inns and travelodge are much better quality in service and in decor beds and furniture
