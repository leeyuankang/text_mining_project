the main issue of the hotel has been temperature when i arrived there were degrees in the room not a good start after one hour of maximum ac still degrees management offered a fan but that didn t help and the night turned into a nightmare windows can not be opened it is not acceptable to let guests sleep in a room with degrees the next night i had to keep the door open for a couple of hours to get the temperature to drop a little it was not a problem of my room as i talked to other guests and they were all experiencing the same breakfast quite basic and this would be ok but a small buffet at the end of a stretched room meant a long queue to just get some fruits in a nutshell don t get this hotel in summer especially if you re traveling for business not a good idea to have a business meeting after a restless night soaked
