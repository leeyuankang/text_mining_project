the room wasn t clean and smelled bad no natural light i moved rooms and it wasn t much better breakfast was awful with hard croissants and scrambled eggs that were a strange shade of green staff obviously don t want to work there and that reflects in the service really dated d cor not deserving of a star rating this hotel would be lucky to be considered star
