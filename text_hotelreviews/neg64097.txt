there is a lot to improve here this hotel needs a huge renovation everything is old and not in a comfortable and artistic way starting from the furnitures the elevators floors and bathroom facilities it s definitely not a star hotel and not even close to it the staff was not welcoming at all toilet amenities were cheap and of a bad quality the hairdryer was very old the carpeted floor was dusty even being at the floor the room was very noisy i could hear the train and what the neighbour walking up the stairs the elevator would stop at every floor when going down and let s not talk about the breakfast very poor quality the fruit must have been there since ages and there is no coffee service i asked for an espresso and the waiter wouldn t even know what it was i am often in london but i will try to stay away from this hotel as much as it s possible in the area such an historical building should be much more evaluated and its potentially very nice furnitures really need a management who cares and understands international standards
