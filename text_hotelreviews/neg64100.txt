the hotel was very dilapidated the decour was early and in very poor condition with threadbear carpets torn faded and worn wallpaper and furnishings that were all very cheap dark brown and genrally damaged life expired this is possibly the worst hotel i have ever stayed at and had it not been for the fact that i had already paid and was staying only for one night i would have walked away from it a more depressing place it is hard to imagine staying at and it is not worth anyting like the rates they charge i paid for one night in my opinion i have stayed at far better hotels charging per night i will never go back to this hotel and would reccomend it only to people who want to pay a premium price to stay in a tatty run down depressing old fashioned and quite frankly dreadful hotel
