the hotel was tired looking gloomy and dull especially the rooms the brass on all doors and glass were so dirty and covered in finger prints and smears and that is the first impression that we got which confirmed our whole experience of the hotel the furniture in the rooms were battered and tired it was noisy and the first night i was woken up so many times i used the gym and spa which was basic and in no way luxorius as the brochure page in our room suggests it again was tired the spa rusty and dirty looking the sauna was not hot at all either i felt so gloomy in there that i didn t even use the pool the treadmills you could only use for mins as there was a notice put up over the machines the staff were all friendly though i must stress the indian restaurant on site had a set menu and looked a little tired but the food was lovely and came quickly
