my bed was hard you could see feel the coils the pillows didn t help the internet service poor having to pay every day was my not good the free service advised in the room was ridiculous at jenny s all you could eat buffet they needed a better selection of food if your name is international that says it all the juice and water was warm the cups smell if you going to leave them face down you should check if they don t smelled like the mats they were on dinner was sad the selections were poor one night it was closed you offer alternatives but for the people who paid for dinner what then the other restaurants spice was always closed as was fridays the location was nice but it rained so it would have been nice to have a shuttle bus to the tube
