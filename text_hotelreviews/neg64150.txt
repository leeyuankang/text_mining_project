the wifi is not free in rooms only in the lobby you have to pay if you want wifi in your room which was a surprise because on the site it states wifi was free this hotel also has an pool however its not free and you have to pay pp to use the pool and to use a towel now i know why the room was so cheap because the hotel makes you pay for everything
