the bed was pretty hard and uncomfortable it also wasn t very wide whilst i appreciate you can t necessarily accommodate my body i have slept in better beds at less expensive hotels the breakfast quality was only adequate the croissants were dry cold and hard the location of the breakfast buffet resulted in congestion and it was poorly laid out e g breakfast cereal dispensers at head height queue for hot food blocking other selections there are lovely low leather sofas in the bar but they look a bit tired now and one had been poorly repaired with black tape the evening carvery looked inviting for me but my wife is a vegetarian and her option was limited to a mushroom risotto
