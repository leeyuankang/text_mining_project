the gym was extra i had to pay pounds per day or pounds for a week the breakfast was rather poor considering the price of pounds on two separate occasions as i was having my drink at the lobby i saw mice right beside the window overlooking the canal quite disturbing i should say the hotel is listed as however the furniture and the bed are fairly old which makes it instead of internet was free only in the lobby and had to re sign in every minutes quite inconvenient for people who are on a business trip
