check in was simple and fast on entering the lift there was a large notice saying keep bags where you can see them and thieves operate in this area the room was ok but very run down it had damp in the corner and the services like hairdryer did not work the worst thing was the rats in the hotel we spotted a number of them and did complain to the reception via phone but was not called back by the manager as promised on check out we explained the hotel was not very clean generally and they had an issue with rats the reception refused to get the manager and told us we needed to send an email they also explained that the rats were due to building works next door and location of the hotel to the river this is one hotel to avoid needs a good refit and some general tlc it reminded me of the hostels in asia when backpacking at least those guys were friendly
