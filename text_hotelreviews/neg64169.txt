staff at reception seemed very inexperienced and didn t really know what he was doing and a manager came out while i was waiting to check in completely ignored me waiting but let another woman come right past me that he knew and he helped her i found this very unprofessional and extremely poor service the room i booked was for a double bed and it was two single beds pushed together i didn t want to waste any more of my evening going back out to complain after the time i was made to wait to just check in very disappointed i didn t booked a hotel of this standard to expect this type of experience
