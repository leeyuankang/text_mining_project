room was cold with very loud air conditioning but there were no controls in the room to turn it off room did not have a window which we knew at booking but we did not realise that this would mean that the room would be really hidden away from the other rooms almost as if you were in the staff quarters no one directed us to our room and as the rooms numbers did not follow in numerical order it took us over minutes to locate our room we were actually over the other end of the building to the other room numbers that were in the s rather than with them mould on the shower curtain was also not a very nice surprise
