the hotel stay was overpriced the breakfast was budget in terms of the ingredients used and not alot was on offer definitely wasnt worth the remote and phone in our room was dusty the hotel looks very plush on the hotside but not well maintained on the inside with the elevator smelling of cigarette also the parking for hours are they going to wash it too i would not stay again at all as i dont think i got value for money whatsover the gym is a session too
