cleaning floor in bathroom was dirty and food was on carpet just by sofa it had been cleaned but obviously had only been done quickly which i think is an issue with most hotels re the staff to room ratio to cover all rooms cleaners have to cut corners i could have complained at the time but it wasn t really too much of an issue considering how much i paid for the room
