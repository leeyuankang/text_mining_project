my only gripe is that the staff in the breakfast buffet are too eager to clear tables frequently i d go up to get some food from the self serve counter and come back to find any hot drink i d left had been cleared away while i was gone at one point i even had to take cutlery from another table as mine had been cleared away while i was gone but this is a very minor gripe for an otherwise flawless hotel
