the facilities were out dated the decor was awful not what i would expect from a hotel in canary wharf location the quilt on the bed was thin as the the room was cold i couldn t stay warm there was no mini bar in the room the toilet tap handles easily came apart when turning the tap on and off it felt like a cheap hotel in a wonderful location i would not be staying here in future or recommending it
