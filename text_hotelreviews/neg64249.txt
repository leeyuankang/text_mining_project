ther coffee was awful completely undrinkable the worst i have experienced in a hotel as someone who only drinks coffee in the morning and without milk it was not a good start to my day the breakfast seemed as if it had been there a while the bacon was dried out the sausages overcooked the price of the room this room has been available to friends who have stayed there for i paid but it was the best deal in the area
