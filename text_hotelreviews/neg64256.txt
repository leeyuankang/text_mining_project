i arrived and they could not accept the corporate card my company gave to them and i had to pay with mine the shower did not have cold water in the morning so i could not wash myself i said this to the reception when i came back in the late afternoon the reception ensured that the problem was fixed but as soon as i went in the room i realised it was not so i called them again the plumber finally came and said to me that nobody had told him anything during the day interent access had to be regularly renewed which caused me several time to go offline with my laptop i asked for a taxi to the reception and a private driver came offering me a fixed price it was too late for changing so between cw and city i paid pounds
