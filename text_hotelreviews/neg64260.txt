the room smelt of old stale smoke it was a none smoking floor so it was either the airconditioning filters that needed changing or the room was close to an external vent where people were smoking the room was on the floor so it wasn t close to an outside smoking area very puzzling also the furniture and decor in the room was looking scratched marked and aged though the room was clean it certainly was overdue for a refurbishment considering it s a hotel in canary wharf
