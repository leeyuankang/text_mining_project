i think the hotel was overpriced for a i have stayed in numerous hotels and this has to be one of the worst i had paid for a double room but when i arrived i found that it was two single beds pushed together they didn t even put on a double quilt there was an annoying green neon light situated above the door which i couldn t turn off it illuminated the room and as a result i had a poor night s sleep i would recommend looking at other hotels in the docklands area
