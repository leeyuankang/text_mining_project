i think the hotel could do with a bit more attention to detail when it comes to presentation i feel it could do with a bit of a revamp it s a classic looking hotel which is great compared to all the newer buildings however if it was maintained a to a greater standard if the windows and rooms etc were kept that little bit more gleaming it would have much greater ambiance
