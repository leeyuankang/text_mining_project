the place is quite trashy and very tacky not what i would expect from a hotel in such a nice location the room had a stiff mattress and a loud creaking bed frame there was no fridge or cooler in the room no drinking water in the room there was almost zero shower pressure the bath was covered in scuff marks the shower grate was snapped with sharp edges awful outdated decor in the room and throughout the hotel the staff were completely disinterested a ridiculously early checkout for the room with an expensive hourly rate to extend it to at the very latest the entire hotel had the smell of burnt toast in the morning even up on the seventh floor
