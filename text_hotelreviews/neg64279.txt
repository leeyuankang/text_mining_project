i was in room which was quite small and the low ceiling combined with no windows felt a bit like a cave i don t really understand why you charge more for a window surely a window is the standard for a room also i think the air conditioning is broken as both mornings at i was awoken by it making a very loud clanging sound for about minutes until i was unable to get back to sleep also the charger on the bathroom light was broken so i was unable to charge my electric toothbrush
