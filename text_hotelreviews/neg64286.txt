the entire hotel is in need of an upgrade you can see that once upon a time it was a very opulent setting but now it is simply run down and in serious need of a face lift our room was near the staff section and so there was a loud noise early morning which woke us and we also had a surprise visit from a member of staff around whom i assume mistook our room for another certainly not but for the price it is good enough
