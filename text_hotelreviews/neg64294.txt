was advised to switch rooms to have two single beds at the check in as we would get a window view the view was of pipes and the window wouldn t even open was told we could push the two beds together but all night they just kept sliding apart and we were barely able to sleep the ac was very noisy and if we turned it off the room got uncomfortably warm found dust in the room and there was no was no toothpaste or toilet brush in the bathroom people in the rooms nearby were very loud at times at night any it resulted in us having s very disrupted sleep not the first time that i ve stayed here so i am very disappointed
