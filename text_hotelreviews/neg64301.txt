there were marks on the walls and bed sheets the windows needed a good clean work definitely needed doing to the bathroom suite the foyer is lovely however the decor of the bedrooms then lets it down it needs completely remodernising it wasn t worth the price we paid just for one night we wish we d payed that little bit extra and stayed at one of the two nicer hotels near by
