this property is very run down the spa facilities were non existent the pool area is dirty most amenities not working there is an extra charge to use these facilities the lifts occasionally smell of marijuana and the room i was given initially was very shabby with very lumpy beds pushed together this hotel is totally nothing like the photos suggest thankfully i was moved to a slightly less grotty room after complaining the view from the lobby seating area is a building site with boards to block any view
