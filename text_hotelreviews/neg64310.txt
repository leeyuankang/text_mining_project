long story short girlfriend booked a room there was no ac window broken and cant be opened needed another room hotel said only twin rooms available but i checked online and there was a double so i had to book the double and pay for it so we are paying for rooms because of the hotel this all seemed unethical and the heat in the room was frankly dangerous i moved on from this but was still annoyed but what felt like the unfair loss of the next day we moved to another room that the hotel said was cooler and it was for a moment but again there was no ac and no window so the heat eventually stated to build up the cleaner barely cleaned the room when asked to and attempted to just flip over the dirty pillow cases instead of changing them asked for a fan times before receiving one attempted to complain politely a number of times manager said he could do nothing customer services said to contact booking com to attempt to get a refund as if booking com put us in a room where the heating was broken and stuck as degrees and booking com could try and get a refund if the hotel is and i quote willing to cooperate last complaint was to an awful awful manager who essentially said i had to accept the fact that i spent a ridiculous amount of money on a second room that day as hard luck gave a half assed apology i ll admit to being rude myself but felt justified this isnt as detailed as i would like but in short i kept extending my stay here because the location is the most convenient for my work but this place is just awful and non of the prices justifiable for a star hotel for of internet on device in what a joke sadly just not a funny one
