by far the worst hotel i ve been to in ages mind i am in a different one every week things just don t work staff contradict each other on several occasions for me food is below all standards except the indian restaurant that one is decent there are all sorts of weird hacks like paper ticket vouchers for breakfast in the century and a clamped paper jacket for your magnetic keycard that gets stamped with a red or black stamp to indicate whether your card was preauthorised just look at the irony of that an exchange office that they claim they have but can t exchange on the grounds that they do not have that amount of cash yet then suddenly can when you ask if they are having a laugh and then claim they can t provide you with a receipt for that transaction until you repeat the question about having a laugh when they suddenly can the evening receptionist telling you you can sort everything out upon check out at yet the night one next morning insisting it s impossible to charge you and print an invoice until you have a severe fall out and then suddenly everything is possible this booking for an extra day had to be done online because upon my arrival according to the reception they do not do bookings in the hotel i wonder what would have happened if i insisted they did i d booked it immediately upon my arrival and was told everything was settled only to be literally thrown out of my room and told i had to check in again on the last day unfortunately all of that sums up into a strong and lasting impression resembling a cheap sharm el sheikh holiday facility rather than a canary wharf establishment charging quid a night for the room alone
