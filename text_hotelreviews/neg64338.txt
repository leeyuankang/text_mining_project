the decor is very tired wallpaper curling away from the walls at the corners very faded carpets across the hotel multiple chips and blemishes in the bathroom windows in the bar area have possibly never been cleaned it looks like it would have been a beautiful hotel when it was last refurbished but that very likely wasn t this century the room was very noisy from approx until due to the dlr and the fact a window in the room was broken open and i wear hearing aids so may be intolerable for a normal hearing person the plumbing was dangerous due to the temperature of the shower consistently veering from stone cold to scalding hot causing my partner to get burnt i found the beds to be very firm which isn t to my liking but may be to your liking reception staff weren t interested in my attempts to point out the broken items in the room and the duty manager fobbed me off by saying to just email them instead it was very difficult to get my booking amended and resulted in over on the phone using a premium priced phone line being passed back and forth between departments
