we were on honeymoon and although given an upgraded room which was very nice of the staff our bed was two singles put together so that wasn t as good but still comfortable haveing to pay for wifi access was a pain and even though you could have lots of minutes free time per day in your room this wasn t long enough especially when trying to plan activities and transport for the day there was alot of building work happening right outside our window so this didn t give us the best view but didn t interrupt our say atall as we spent most of our time out of the hotel only returning in the evening room decor was very dated and aged as wallpaper was peeling away in places and there was scratches on the walls also so could do with some modernisation but overall good
