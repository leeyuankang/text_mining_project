i had stayed here on three previous occasions so was a little disappointed to find that the d cor had just grown even more tired than usual little things that for the price paid should have been fixed as part of the day to day maintenance the bathroom had mould in along one side of the bath the fitting for the soap dish was loose and fell off when i knocked it the tap covers on the shower were missing and so the whole thing just looked dreadful in the room itself the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and parts of the paper had started peeling off the walls there were water stains where the kettle had been boiled against the wall why oh why does a business based hotel in canary wharf charge for internet it s difficult to login and the hassle and payment just made me want to cry in the end i gave up and used my work phone to get internet access the breakfast in such a prestigious hotel needs looking at food was either cold overcooked or both many of the items in the hot buffet tasted like they had been sat in the heating trays for a couple of days a tray of fried eggs fresh from the kitchen had yolks that were rock solid the first day i gave it the benefit of the doubt but the second day just awful check in was a tortured affair with a not fully trained member of staff left unsupervised it took four goes to get a card authorised then the extras were not added so the fifth time we were lucky i was asked three times if i had a car and normally this would not be problem but at at night after a busy day i could feel my patience getting tested britannia if you want your guests to enjoy their stay you need to get check in sorted and more efficient
