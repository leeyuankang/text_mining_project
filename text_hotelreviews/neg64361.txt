i would never stay here again as the lady on reception was the rudest person i had come across she needs a lesson in customer service she kept trying to grab a groupon leaflet that we said was not for this she was awful then tried to put us in a dearer room which we did not want when we left she did not even thanks us for staying we said bye and completely ignored us i was disgusted she was european and youngish dreadful lady and i am sure she has had many complaints as was so rude
