the room and facilities were generally worn the bed was well used and therefore had grooves the room was very hot and difficult to cool down and no windows opened i had to change room as the tv in my first room did not work the staff were reluctant to move me which i understand but having a working tv when travelling alone is a basic expectation this is a one night max hotel staying for any longer would not be tolerable
