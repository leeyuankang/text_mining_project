the hotel is a bit dated but has a good location our carpets were ripped and coming off the floor he bathroom had a strange smell we were on the floor and after a tiring day going around london all we needed was a good sleep only to be woken around am by a drunk woman banging on someone else s door we rang reception who then came and got the woman out but she was back within half an hour which meant we didn t sleep thereafter the staff the next morning did not offer an apology and told us they were unaware this had happened we were given an email address to complain if we felt like it
