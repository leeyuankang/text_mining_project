the hotel was dirty windows very smeared and streaked so could not see outside the bed was like sleeping on an ironing board and the pillow the same breakfast was truly disgusting mess everywhere in the dining hall salt and pepper missing out of virtually every cruet pot the self service area was a mess the scrambled egg was dry like rubber the porridge was caked inches deep to the wall of the cooking pot the bacon was a blue grey colour the fried eggs were swimming in oil the sausages were deep fried to cremation the coffee smelled terrible cheap the staff had no care for their jobs with what appeared non existent staff motivation and the cook s clothing was badly stained and dirty yet he was allowed to come out to the dining area to replenish food supplies with even more sad looking food if i was assessing this my profession is in internal auditing establishment from a company perspective i would fail it on many levels where food and staff were concerned and would insist on a plan of action by the general manager to vastly improve immediately
