room on the floor was very noisy due to i believe a broken ventilation system just outside the window i usually do not have problems with noise but that was a bit too much could not sleep the whole night needed to change room they kindly assigned me a new room on the floor much better but i could still hear the noise first time in quite a long time that i do not have free wifi in a hotel room room furniture might need renovation breakfast variety and quality might be improved
