they didn t warn you that the hotel is near a construction so it is very noisy even in weekends am soft mattress the water kept running out off the shower when i called to reception complaining about it they asked me to come downstairs to get an email so i had to go downstairs at the middle of the night and after they gave me the email to send my complaint i asked to talk with the night manager although he was there he took his time to attend me he ordered me to sit down because i refused to do it he left me talking by myself very rude and impolite i wrote to the email they told me asking for refund and until now there has not been any response from the hotel the business i attended was with london people and when i shared my experience they told me that the hotel has a very bad reputation on customer service but it was too late this have been one of the worst hotels i ve ever stayed i was so angry because when booking i asked for a quiet room they should have told me of the near construction
