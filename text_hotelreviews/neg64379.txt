i had no room in my window it was extremely hot and the air con didn t work and i wasn t allowed to use the facilities without paying an additional charge absolutely outrageous i was there for work and unfortunately did not sleep well for nights what hotel in their right mind would put a guest in their room without a window for such a prestigious hotel i was extremely disappointed
