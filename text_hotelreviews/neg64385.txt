although we did get an upgrade on arrival from a room with no window to one with a window the beds were too hard and the noise from outside consistently noisy through the night which meant we did not get hardly any sleep we paid for breakfast at the hotel as it wasn t in our room rate it was very expensive each and the quality of the food and the service was poor we would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone else
