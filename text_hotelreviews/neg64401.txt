nevertheless there are number of things that can be improved and not all will have an impact on their profitability internet in the room has to be paid most of the hotels include this in the daily rate and even if i paid once for the service i had several problem of connection actually money wasted water in the room or ml bottles is a normal practice in good hotels flexible breakfast arrangement allowing the guest to have a breakfast whenever she he wants is to me a better arrangement than obliging to commit all days of the reservation the room service was not efficient and in occasion i had to remind the reception of doing the room in one instance they forgot to do the room and then in the afternoon was too late i also asked twice to have the shampoo and shower gel in both occasion they forgot to supply the material the telephone in the room is not designed to make national and international calls so basically this hotel is not good for business trip when conf call are needed after days having paid a fair amount i have asked for a late check in i had to pay for each late hour although i got a discount to be honest most of the hotels has given me this for free i have never paid a penny for a late check out when in the hotel restaurants i had to pay straight away rather than paying the difference at the check out very disappointing to order coffee lunch and whatever else and be always with a credit card or cash to pay the balance immediately breakfast not a good selection of food croissants and ham were really bad to access the swimming pool and or the gym there is an entrance fee if i did not misunderstand again most other hotels offer this service for free the bed was with thin mattress and during the night i could feel the springs jumping and making strange noise not very comfortable
