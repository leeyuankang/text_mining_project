the hotel is quite dated and in need of a makeover the temperature control in our room did not work and it was like a sauna rang several times for a member of housekeeping to sort it out after numerous calls someone came and told us it was broken offered to move us but not at opened window to cool down the room which meant it was noisy throughout the night
