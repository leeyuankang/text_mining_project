the first room we were given was flooded there was water all over the bathroom floor and despite booking a double room the room had two single beds the second room after going back to reception to ask for a new room was a smoking room and the smell hit us as soon as the door opened being non smokers this was inconvienient to use the facilities in the hotel pool gym it was an extra charge on top of the price for the room considering this is a star hotel you d have expected that cost to be included
