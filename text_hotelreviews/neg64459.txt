we ate in the pizzeria in the hotel i had a jacket potato it was brown in side when i pointed this out they said it was fresh cooked the day before they didn t offer to change it or take it off the bill i had to argue with the duty manager the room was degrees we asked to lower the temperature but all they did was open a window we could not sleep in such a stuffy hot room
