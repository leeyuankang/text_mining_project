the staff we called the hotel ahead of our arrival to ask if there was parking we were told their was what we wasn t told was it was so upon arrival we were met with a parking fee in a non secure car park we tried to speak to the duty manager who was absurdly rude he spoke to us with no respect and told us if we didn t like the parking cost we could leave we were in complete shock he was so rude we are very well travelled and have never encountered such rudeness we also found the rooms dirty hairs in the bed wall paper hanging off unkept carpet now for the grand finally rats there were rats that we saw on separate occasions and in different parts of the hotel my advice avoid this pit of a hotel
