this hotel would have been really nice about years ago sadly its suffering from urban decay and is in dire need of investment it s by no means bad its just looking abit tired and needs serious amounts of investment however it being a britannia it will ran into the ground and then sold to a developer however the price was reflective of the above for what i paid i would stay again
