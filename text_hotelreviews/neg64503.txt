breakfast was cold and had been left out for a while no fresh batches were brought out the croissants were even tough the bed mattress was so hard it was uncomfortable to sleep on on the day of departure we were refused entrance to the gym and pool apparently even guests have to pay to use these on top of what you pay to stay the night i have never stayed in a hotel where you cannot use the facilities there was no confirmation of this on our booking nor did anyone inform us when we checked in although the location is good only minute walk to canary wharf the view from the room is just of a building site from the moment we arrived the sound of drills were evident
