breakfast finished st on saturday so went at to find most items on the buffet hadn t been replenished and what was there looked very unappetising asked if we could have poached eggs and were told that the kitchen had closed after asking if the hot trays would be refilled someone came out within minutes with a tray of very overcooked looking sausages at which point we decided to leave and ask for our breakfast payment to be refunded manager not accommodating and refused to refund us we checked out and walked minutes to carluccio s and had an amazing breakfast freshly cooked with excellent produce my advice don t pay extra for breakfast at this hotel plenty of choice within very close walking distance and cheaper too
