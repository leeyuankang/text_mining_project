there was a fly in my pasta one staff at the hotel was rude and even wanted to charge us for asking to have a cover to carry our food to our room we later spotted a mouse running round the waiting area the salmon pasta smelt foul the room took ages to clean and we had to ask for sheets to change it ourselves the heater in the room does not work just hated the whole experience in this hotel
