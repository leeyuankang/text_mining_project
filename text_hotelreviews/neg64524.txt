horrific weekend persuaded to upgrade when we arrived our upgraded room was over looking a building site not the river as assured we were unable to notice this when we initially went to the room as it was dark however at the dlr started and then at the building works started when we asked to speak to duty manager he was busy so waited when he finally came to talk to us it was apparent he had been busy having a cigarette we delayed speaking to anyone as i just wanted to get out of the hotel in the morning and try and enjoy the weekend so spoke upon our return early evening to which he told me i should have complained earlier we were eventually moved however to a smaller room despite paying upgrade when we went to our room to pack up our luggage before moving it was clear housekeeping hadn t cleaned anything just poorly made a bed in general the hotel was run down and in the middle of a building site a gin and tonic is served in a half pint glass lift glass is shattered and both rooms we had were freezing when we first entered as the heating is off until u go in
