they charge extra for everything from wifi to early check in to car park to breakfast i think they charge for the pool too so the price is not representative given what you end up paying also there was a power cut just effecting the hotel meaning i had to get dressed in the dark have a cold shower go to a business meeting with my hair wet and not be able to make a drink i asked for compensation or a refund and they just didn t bother replying
