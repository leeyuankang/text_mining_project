the receptionist wasn t particularly welcoming and was very stern didn t smile however got past that my main disappointment throughout my stay was there was a huge building sight right outside my window which started making loud noises from as early as which i hadn t been told about when i checked in had i of known this i would of purchased a room with no window or on the other side of the building so i actually got some sleep ready for my meeting early the following morning also a member of staff opened my door at and came in waking me up with no apology just quickly slamming the door behind him her hopefully you can offer me something to compensate my not so good stay at your hotel i would really appreciate if this is a possibility
