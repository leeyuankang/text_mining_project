the room was ok but clearly a bit worn in places temp control on the wall could not make the room cool we asked the facilities management to look at this but they did not appear to understand how a thermostat worked the temp shown is the room temp sir if you open the window the temp will go down so they opened the window and the room did get cool january on the floor the thermostat on the wall appeared to be stuck at the fan was a bit noisy and rattled the a c ducting however the dlr line is quite close so the noise from the trains was the price to pay for a cool room not a big problem but i did get up first thing ish to shut the window
