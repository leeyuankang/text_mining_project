staff did not appear very happy guy at breakfast reception was a total misery and could barely bring himself to speak to us hotel is very tired beds totally uncomfortable worst thing of all was having to face a bowl of vomit yes vomit which was left on one floor by the lifts for two days and even after complaint to reception it was left there that s a first in any hotel ranking it as the worst hotel stay ever no price is worth what this place has to offer
