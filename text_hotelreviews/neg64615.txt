the decor was extremely old and badly worn the room was clean but the double bed consisted of two very uncomfortable single mattresses put on a double base very limited tea and coffee in the room we could have one cup of black tea and coffee each the shower over the bath was very difficult to regulate the temperature of the water the breakfast was supposed to be served until we got to the breakfast room at stood at the sign to be seated and staff just looked at us and carried on clearing tables i then approached a staff member and asked if we were just to sit anywhere and they smiled and said yes the breakfast was hot which was good but there were no cups available for tea and the glasses were very stained there is a view of the water but the windows are so dirty you can t actually see out it s a real shame as it could be a lovely hotel but i m under the impression that it s really neglected
