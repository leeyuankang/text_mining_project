the reception staff was extremely rude and could not speak english properly the staff made up a story that i used vulgar language which was a lie i then asked for the manager who corrected the situation this occurred the first time at reception on check in but the next day i was complaining about the bar staff attitude and again the staff made up a story that i used vulgar language the staff at this hotel clearly lie and accuse guests of things which are not true i will be taking these accusations up to the owners of the hotel the hotel was smelly with smoking smells they are a lot of hidden charges that was very surprising there is also no doorman you also have to pay for wi fi
