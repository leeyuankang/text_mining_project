i did not like the stink of cigarettes throughout the hotel including the bedroom floors my bedroom didn t smell but everywhere else i found stank of either stale or fresh cigarettes breakfast should be included at the price you are charging also i was annoyed that i had to pay for wifi as i had to stay for nights a small built in fridge would have been useful for me to keep some food drinks i also think not being able to leave any personal items in a hotel room is worrying there was a card on the table advising your guests not to leave anything valuable in the room in order for you to print these cards distribute them in every room means items must be going walkies on a regular basis that was a little concerning every day i had to bring my laptop kindle phone charger to work with me
