weekend staff took minutes to attend to us to check us in on arrival they were unfriendly and dismissive didn t answer phone despite repeated attempts and took three calls and an hour to respond to replace a missing hairdryer toilet was unflushed when we arrived and whole room smelt we were in a non smoking room but the whole floor stunk of smoke not a good experience
