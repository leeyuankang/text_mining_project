i have booked a smoking room in advance and when i arrived in the hotel they just told there s no any available smoking room so i was in the floor and i had to go downstairs to smoke in the cold need to pay for the swimming pool i though was a star hotel and no free wifi in the room in the business district this is unacceptable
