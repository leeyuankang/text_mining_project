the pound a night room stunk of smoke was freezing cold and constant noise coming from the heating system which you can t turn off the carpet was dirty and dust everywhere we were unable to sleep so early hours moved to another room with the same problem the last thing you need when you ve had a whole day shopping in london on arrival we knew we d made a bad decision the decor was dated there was people all over the place drinking cans of stella and couldn t get any staff to help us with anything after complaining and requesting a refund as it completely ruined our stay and pound for the service just isn t good enough we were offered a complimentary upgrade for next time we stay we won t be staying ever again and an upgrade costs pound on top of minimum so what are they playing at britannia far from it no one is british in there and i wouldn t ever recommend this to my worst enemy
