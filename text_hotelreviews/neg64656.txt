you could feel the springs through the the mattress the constant drone of trains and paper thin walls meant sleep was sparse when i actually got up i realized what an utter disgrace the room was furniture was scuffed or broken bed frames were rickety with metal bits hanging off blood stains on the carpet stains on the walls and bathroom ceiling and ripped upholstery and wallpaper the overall decor was also extremely dated i was offered a window view but couldn t see out as the windows were filthy also there was one usable socket for a phone charger but this was not near the bed or seating area and most of the light switches didn t work
