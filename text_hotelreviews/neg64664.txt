it was extremely cold when i got in the thermostat allowed me to put the temp higher but there was only cold air coming in i received a heater which saved me the furniture is very old there are no plugs by the night stands i tried moving the night stand to remove the lamp but to my surprise that plug was smaller than a regular uk plug and there was trash behind the night stand everything about this hotel is outdated the breakfast is very cheap definitely not worth the extortionate amount of money i was charged per night and to top it all off upon checkout i needed an invoice with my company details details which were already provided at checkin and also details which were transferred to the hotel from my booking account needless to say that the guy at the reception had no idea of what i needed and claimed my company details were not provided when i actually wrote them down manually at checkin as well so that s sources for the same information very disappointing
