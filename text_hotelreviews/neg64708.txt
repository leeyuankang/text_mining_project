there is a hilton located metres from this hotel i suggest to spend a night more and stay at the hilton instead of this hotel the hotel desperately needs to be refurbished all communal areas share decor with the hotel from the shining there were also a lot of problems with basic functions which most people take for granted in a hotel such as plumbing and air conditioning there was a problem with the tap which controlled the temperature of the shower making it impossible to adjust the water temperature i informed the hotel but they did not fix this before i returned to my room the following evening the air conditioning in the room was not working with the ambient temperature c when i arrived i could not open the windows because they had been fastened with screws i also object to having to pay extra to use a hotel gym especially when the gym is in such a poor state with ancient equipment and holes in the walls
