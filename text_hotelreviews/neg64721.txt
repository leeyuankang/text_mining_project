the heating wasn t controllable for our room the staff had putting the fans on override so that it always blew out hot air even when choosing cool we had to go to reception on more than one occasion to complain at pm we still couldn t sleep and was very uncomfortable so i made my way back down to reception where i had to wait in a long line of people checking in i was very tired they said they would send someone up to open out window which had been screwed shut am we finally had a nock on the door where a member of reception came in with a spanner and a tool to open the window this meant i had to sit awake to let them in it took a good half hour for the room to cool so finally got to sleep gone am we were told that the windows were screwed shut because of the outside noise i m sure customers should be allowed to choose whether or not they can handle the noise with the window open on top of this the member of staff didn t leave us with any tools to close the window this meant we had to sleep and all night and morning with the window wide open as there was no way of shutting it with out this caused the rain to come in the window too came away from the trip with two poor nights sleep and not feeling refreshed at all
