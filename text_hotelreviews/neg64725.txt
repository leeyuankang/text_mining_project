most of the receptionist were brilliant but this guy called john was an absolute disgrace to customer service he made a very simple task a scene and as difficult to resolve for no reason a man called stonney resolved the issue within seconds which i really appreciated but still appalled by that man called john if he cannot tolerate ppl maybe it s best he doesn t work in that role apart from that great stay fast room service
