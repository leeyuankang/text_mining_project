horrible experience first of all the reception staff did not advise us that we had to pay for swimming and the towels which is totally unfair as we are already paying for the stay second off all the swimming facilite and sauna was very dirty felt like a cheap swimming lesiure centre we told the staff we will pay extra to stay and they said okay we get to our room and it is locked we was very upset with this would never go back
