the hotel looks and feels very tired room corridors were not kept as clean as i would expect in fact bottle tops remained on the carpet for the entire hours we stayed breakfast felt more like a mass canteen environment no table service at all not even for tea which in my experience would be normal for the price of the stay i had expected a much better experience
