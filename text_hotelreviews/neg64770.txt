it s a freemium hotel sure the price is reasonable but you only get minutes of wifi in your room for free after that you have to shell out money to access the fitness center you have to pay breakfast is not included you can t borrow an adapter for the room and the only way you can buy it is cash i never carry cash with me it s impracticle now that you can pay with almost anything with the card the italian restaurant in the hotel was average or below average the pizza tasted barely better than a frozen dr oetker pizza so very poor value for money there
