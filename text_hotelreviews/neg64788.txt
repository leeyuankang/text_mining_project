the hotel was very old fashion it could do with a little revamp the bar had no atmosphere what s so ever me and my partner wanted a drink saturday night after coming back from a show it was only and there was no music on nor ever just a little sound in the back ground so we took our drinks to the room as it wasn t nice to be in bar the parking was very expensive on top off what your already paying most hotel are free or just a little charge this was for days overall very unhappy with our stay definitely won t be going to any of them hotel again
