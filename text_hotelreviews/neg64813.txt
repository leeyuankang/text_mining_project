the dlr and underground were too far away especially when walking alone late at night there is construction all around blocking many shortcut paths so you have to walk all the way around to get where you are going the bed in the cheaper room was fairly comfortable but the one in the suite with a view was all springs no cushioning they need to get free wifi in the rooms it is paying per day for wifi nope you get free minutes per day only the showers are hard to control temp wise but they were powerful and pretty clean the hotel is very understaffed this combined with the very worn and dated decor explains the price finally the place smells weird they need to get some febreeze or something
