check in is always incredibly slow and the staff can be frustrating this hotel is quite faded and a little out of context in this shiny new area i always ask for a smaller double bed as in the larger rooms it is twin beds joined together which i find really uncomfortable my last visit meant changing rooms three times it was annoying to be moved to a room with exactly the same issue and to take over minutes to get into a room i ve also lost clothing there and despite e mails and me going there it was never recovered which is very poor the air conditioning doesn t work well in some rooms and the dlr sounds can be very noisy at night
