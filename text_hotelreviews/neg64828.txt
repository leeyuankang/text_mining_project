swimming pool was closed due to some works we couldn t take shower as it was very old and water was only hot there was no mini bar in our room the room was for non smokers but there was a strong smell of cigarets we had dinner in italian restaurant downstairs the same which does room service food wasn t good at all and service was slow overall this hotel is very old and requires renovation we paid half price i must say it is definitely not worth the fool price at this condition
