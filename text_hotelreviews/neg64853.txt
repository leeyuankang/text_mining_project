there are plenty of reason for why people should not stay at this hotel air conditioner it does not work as everybody can guess we just froze in the room in late september staff one of the staff knock our door twice at pm while we stand up from our beds he opened our door and said we need to call reception i still could not get how such thing is possible why reception does not call rooms if they have something to say or the staff does not wait at least seconds for door to be opened rooms the room was too old beds were uncomfortable the carpet was completely a cessful what is more there was such a disturbing smell coming from the toilet all the time wifi you need to pay for wireless if you want to connect from your room
