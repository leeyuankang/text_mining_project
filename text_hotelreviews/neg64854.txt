the photos and reviews were excellent and i wanted a pool but the place is just shabby the lobby has ridiculous uncomfortable sofas and you have to go there for wi fi or you have to pay for it that is reason enough to skip this place not to mention scuffed furniture torn wall paper carpet worn and seams coming apart the location is next to a construction site on sides the train track screeches constantly and the pool area was closed there is no reason at all to go there to visit london its too far away from everything i was doing business in that end and thank goodness i had to leave early the service was fine
