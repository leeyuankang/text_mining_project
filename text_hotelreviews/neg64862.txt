the noise i had the worst night sleep in my life the first night i woke up and couldn t go back to sleep from the cooling fans outside the second night i didn t sleep at all absolutely none sleep as those fans are ever so loud it was so frustrating all i wanted to do is put my head in my hands and cry i tried everything i put some cotton pads in my ears i put a pillow over my head nothing it was horrible we booked a room without a window and when we got there they didn t have such room left so they upgraded us for a room with a window perhaps if we had our original room we wouldn t hear that dreadful noise when we checked out the receptionist just asked what room number we were in and no how was your stay just ok thank you bye also it was my birthday and the next day got kinda ruined as we were sooo tired i will never ever stay in this britannia hotel again and i would really strongly advise everyone not to stay there it might be cheap but the fans are really loud i can t emphasise enough how bad it was really and so very frustrating
