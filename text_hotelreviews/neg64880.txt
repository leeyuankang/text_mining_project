i had requested a cot for my months baby in my booking and it wasn t there when we arrived i asked the reception twice to bring it but they ignored me once and sencond time they said their maiden is off work at that time and they will bring it next day morning my baby fell down the bed the next day morning and nobody cared about that when i asked for manager he didn t want to talk to me or apologize instead he was trying to blame me for not taking care of my baby it was completely strange to me the bed in the room was at its worst condition springs out and injured my husbands leg they also told us that breakfast served until but the second morning when i went down to restaurant in the morning they said it is only on weekend up to they didn t let me in altogether it was an awful experience for us and we thank god that we got out of there with no more disaster
