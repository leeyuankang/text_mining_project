d cor is incredibly old they are not investing in any type of renovations very basic channels offered on tv don t know why but really slow to load a channel don t recommend to take the breakfast option it s very expensive considering what they offer wifi in the lobby area is free but only for minutes in the rooms you get minutes per day and if you buy a voucher it s pounds per day and only works for one device overall i won t come back again in my next visit to london for sure there are better options than the britannia with a better price
