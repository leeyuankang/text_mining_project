my partner and i and another couple booked double executive rooms however our room was like a standard double and theres was amazing with a balcony our bedroom windows were filthy dirty went to the toilet and got locked inside it took my partner mins to get me out very unsafe if it was a child in there no value for money as this was a very standard room and could not make the most of the view as windows were vile the hotel staff were very polite just a shame the room was rubbish
