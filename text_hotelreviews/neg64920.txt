the booking was made by myself for my son the response of the staff and inflexibility in their manner was extremely disappointing they were not prepared to accept a cash payment for the booking and were prepared to turn my son away even though the room had been secured with a debit card they would not accept payment by phone with the debit card details and were very rigid in their approach i would not ever recommend britannia hotels to anyone
