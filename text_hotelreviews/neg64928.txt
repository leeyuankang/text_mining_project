it s certainly not a hotel it s very much a hotel so selling themselves as a is definitely pushing it in our room there was a huge amount of noise coming from our ceiling like a grinding fan or something that made it very hard to sleep furthermore the room service was rude and poor i called up with no response so thought i may have entered the wrong number when i called again i had an angry lady on the end of the phone who told me that we re busy so maybe you should have thought that s why we didn t pick up your call when the food was delivered to the room it was poor and not as described on the menu
