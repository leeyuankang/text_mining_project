we was placed into the new part of the hotel which felt far to small and didn t feel like i was in the britannia we stayed there previous for a lower rate but had a lovely room however this time we was charged a fee to change room but we found out later after having a drink with another couple in the bar that they paid for exactly same room as we did but was upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi free of charge this was very upsetting as i don t think we was treated fairly when i questioned it with the hotel staff i was told there was nothing they could do and didn t even have time to care for us or maybe just offer us out refund back it s a shame as we always choose to come here we was told that the hotel is under new management and they don t offer different rooms anymore but yet i knew otherwise as the other couple we met confirmed that the staff was lying to us the breakfast wasn t as nice as before either very dry and bad quality wasn t worth paying each we went there with the intention of staying for nights but chose to stay else where after being treated unfair we opted for the hilton next door
