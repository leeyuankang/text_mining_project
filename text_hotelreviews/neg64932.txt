we were in a windowless room and the only air seemed to be this little fan which couldnt cope in the heat also to get to the room which was an odd number was like a maize and took forever going up and down stairs and around corners even though was meant to be first floor the coridor had a wooden sound when walking and you could hear every step also a few nights there were kids and teens running up and down the parking garage also is a place to avoid expensive and dingy and you actually have to walk up the same drive you drove in on
