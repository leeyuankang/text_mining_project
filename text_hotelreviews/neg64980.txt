at check in i was delighted to see the spices indian restaurant and immediately made dinner plans the restaurant was very quiet and i perhaps i discovered why i ordered a glass of what purported to be rioja and indeed it might have been but tasted like it came from a bottle which had been left half empty for days or longer on sending it back as off the waiter clearly disagreed with me but agreed to bring me a shiraz instead which tasted remarkably similar to the supposed rioja and similarly off so i reverted to beer and waited for the food to be fair the masala fish starter was ok however the lamb rogan reminded me of some sort of re constituted packet meal from the the type of meat i m assuming it was meat was indeterminate there was no evidence of spicy hotness and it was accompanied by a peshwari nan which had a vague sprinkling of something resembling desiccated coconut but nothing else it was without doubt one of the worst culinary experiences of my life my advice stay at the hotel but avoid the indian restaurant
