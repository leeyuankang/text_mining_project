i had booked an extra bed for a child and received confirmation of this but the hotel had not made up the bed and said they had no record of this from booking com i then needed to go back down to reception to pay for this immediately room service had to be paid for there and then and toast couldn t be provided before extra charges for pool and spa with early closing times extra charges for towel hire for the pool basically extra charges for everything a normal hotel would add these to the room for payment to be made at check out but all had to be paid for at the time poor service
