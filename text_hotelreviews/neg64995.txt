i have stayed at the hotel numerous times this year due to locality of my workplace it is normally a reasonably priced hotel with a comfortable stay unfortunately on this occasion my stay was awful the toilet in the room had a disgusting smell of smoke which seemed to come from a balcony on the floor this was constant with the air con not making any difference the bed was terrible and was on the verge of breaking this will be my last stay here i will be taking my custom elsewhere
