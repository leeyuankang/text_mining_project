towels tea bags and wifi i find it incredible that hotels of this standard cannot provide larger towels and decent tea i m equally amazed that in this day and age there is a charge for wifi in rooms i ve stayed in many hotels abroad and many of a lower standard and rating than this where wifi is free in all areas i took a special offer of a reduced rate on windowless room the electric fan provided relief but why doesn t a hotel of this standard have ac anyway
