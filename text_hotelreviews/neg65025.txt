other reviewers described this hotel as tired i would add shabby and mediocre you have to pay for wifi in your room they advertise free wifi in the lobby but this is only minutes day and doesn t seem very reliable it s clear that maintenance is not a priority at this hotel for example some genious replaced the toilet seat in my room with a larger model that prevented the bathroom door from opening fully the paintings were hanging from a single nail the windows in the bar looked like they hadn t been cleaned all year the room furnishings included a dressing table in front of the window with a mirror that obscured most of the view the pizza at their italian restaurant looked and tasted like frozen takeout the house wine was undrinkable i would stay here again if there were no other options but i would spend as little time in the hotel as possible there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby with free wifi and really good food
