the service in the dining room at breakfast was not as good as previously there was no fruit left apart from prunes and when i asked for some was told it had all gone also the table hadn t been cleaned properly however when i went back to the service bar after complaining i found that the grapefruit had been replenished otherwise the breakfast was good
