the spa was subject to an extra charge even for guests and you were expected to use your room towels which was strange and left you with wet towels in the room i don t expect a hotel of this size and standard to not have wifi throughout and annoying that they also limit access to it for goodness sake in this day and age wifi should be available free of charge in all hotel rooms it is very shortsighted as the hotel lost income because rather than stay in the hotel i went to a cafe in canary wharf for an excellent breakfast and lunch because not only was it cheaper but mainly because there was free wifi there were extensive building works going on next to the hotel which meant that there was a lot of noise from diggers and demolition work from early in the morning so even though i was on holiday it wasn t very relaxing and impossible to use the room during the day i know the hotel couldn t help this but maybe a warning about it and an option of a room on the other side of the hotel might have been nice
