almost everything the hotel needs an urgent renewal the furniture were super old and they were in bad state the bathrooms belong to other times and the carpet was old and full of dust besides all the doors made of wood were totally scratchy the communal rooms and swimming pool were always crowded and to be honest taking into account the state of the rest of the hotel we didn t dare to go into the swimming pool besides the communication with the rest of the city is not the best one
