the free wifi is only in the public spaces not the rooms which in this day and age feels a little ridiculous especially when many people will be visitors to the uk or on business so it s even more important the rooms and the whole hotel in general could do with a refurb and some investment into new wall paper lights new bathroom fixtures that have broken i wed surprised for a britannia hotel they would let a room out that clearly needed some love there was also no warning on the amount of noise that would affect guests from the nearby developments as more luxury apartment blocks spring up it s the perfect location for me but not sure i could go back
