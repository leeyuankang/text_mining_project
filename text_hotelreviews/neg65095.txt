the receptionist was moody and not very willing to help she gave me and my husband single beds then made it sound like she was doing me a massive favour by giving me a room with one double bed there was grout smeared all over the tiles in the bathroom and the milk for tea coffee had curdled so we couldn t have anything to drink and they charge parking on top of the already expensive stay the room was far too warm and stuffy and the shower gels were sooo tiny it wouldn t be enough for one person to wash
