the whole place is run down we got a big room at floor where neither trouser press tea cooker was working armchair was very worn and lockers was loose internet did work intermittently so we checked our mails on a restaurant in canary wharf breakfast was the most tasteless i have experienced for long time i sent a jacket for cleaning it come back just pressed not clean the staff seems to be helpless or just fed up with the management they only said i am sorrry never fixed any problem i could also see the building had structural defects might be better they tear the whole crap down and built something new with new management the whole atmosphere reminded me of intourist hotels in soviet union this hotel is a disgrace for london
