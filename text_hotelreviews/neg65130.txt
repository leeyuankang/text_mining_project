many guests had traveled specifically for a concert most of us got back to the hotel around midnight and this is where the problems began firstly one of our group had to wait for nearly an hour to get served at the bar room service we had not eaten since lunchtime so were looking forward to getting a snack via room service at the hotel we tried three times each time we called we were redirected to a phone that never answered and just dropped your call after minutes of ringing at this point i headed downstairs to bring this up with reception however i gave up on that idea after seeing loads of people already waiting there to complain about various things i made my way to the pizzeria where the chef was on the verge of walking out having his phone constantly ringing whilst he was unable to make a pizza as he had no cheese from the time i got into the pizzeria it took minutes to get a drink and when i tried to order food i was told there were no orders being taken not happy
