all fine until i try to dry myself in the morning after my shower a small towel only you can t get round yourself so at check out i waited to be asked was everything ok but she didn t so i said they forgot to put a bath towel in my room i couldn t get dry properly expecting some sympathy oh all the towels are the same size she said the guest next to me suddenly piped up yes i had that problem also she repeated the unhelpful non answer talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory it can t save much money but worse was the fact my polite gentle complaint was not addressed i could be cruel and say she actually confirmed it wasn t an oversight that i couldn t get dry but deliberate policy not happy with this
