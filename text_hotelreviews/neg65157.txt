the bed was two singles put together terribly uncomfortable and hard the room had a musty smoke smell woke up with a headache room had aircon that made the smell worse it was stifling no oxygen circulating and seriously not healthy for anyone this hotel needs serious updating and restructuring adding new windows that can crack open in all rooms i will never stay here again i would get a refund if i could prefer to avoid the hassle i will always remember how annoyed i was that it was money not well spent
