the wifi left a bit to be desired couldn t send an email anywhere in the hotel would be great if wifi were free towels were a bit on the thin side but did the job windows could do with a clean but you have to take into account the amount of construction work that is going on in the area too air conditioning in our room unfortunately did not work too hot for us may be great for other guests only stayed one night otherwise would have brought it to the attention of reception
