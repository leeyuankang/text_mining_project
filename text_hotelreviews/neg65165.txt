though i forgot to include my months old baby in the booking but i was very disappointed when i was told while checking in by that there wasn t any cotbed available for my baby i got even more disappointed when i discovered that use of the swimming pool wasn t included in the booking fee and that onsite parking cost also i disliked the fact that the room didn t have any windows
