i changed my room type from twin to double the day before i arrive and i received the conformation email but they didn t change it and the most unbelievable thing is when we asked their manager for help he just totally don t care about this problem and make no effort at all to help us or explain to us not even said sorry actually he just shake his head said some random words and then walk away by himself
