the standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room we really appreciated that because we were going to spend days in that hotel but even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all london hotels the room did not have central heating it was december and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold when we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold as in all london central hotels this hotel is also not value for money if it were say in munich or milan it definitely would be half this price
