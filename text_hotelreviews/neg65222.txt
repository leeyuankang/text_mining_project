the room was really hot we had asked them to fix the air con but nothing was done that we gave up they made a mistake on my booking and booked two rooms under my name i even called two days before just to make sure they only had one booking and they said that we did then a day after we checked out we were charged pound cancellation fee when we did show up really not happy and won t refer anyone to this hotel i myself am in the hospitality industry and this treatment was really unacceptable
