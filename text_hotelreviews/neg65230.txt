being charged for minutes in the car park what an absolute rip off i will never stay at this hotel ever again when i raised this with reception they did absolutely nothing and just stared at me blankly the room thermostat was stuck at degrees so when i rang reception to ask for a fan and for the locked windows to be opened i was told repeatedly that they were dealing with it but nothing happened at all i checked in just before and even by the following morning the thermostat had only moved to degrees poor poor quality of service and lack of respect from staff avoid
