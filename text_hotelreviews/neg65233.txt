the hotel had no water running for almost hours not even an apology from the staff couldn t shower or even flush the toilet staff kept telling us it should be on after an hour after hours we called reception to complain and she laughed saying must be disgusting not being able to flush the toilet and offered us a voucher for a bottle of water due to this we was not able to enjoy our stay and could not even use the pool as we would not be able to shower and the guccusi was not working either all in all i believe a discount money back should have been arranged as this was disgraceful upon check out the receptionist just took our room keys and didn t even ask how out stay was if all facility s would have been working the hotel would be nice however this wasn t the case
