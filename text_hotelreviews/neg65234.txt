the problem has happened both times we stayed at the property hot water goes of in the middle of the night so in the morning it s a freezing shower also water completely turns off throughout the day around times for hours which means no water to use for making tea washing your face a the odd shower someone wants in the day all these are not possible please check that the pillow covers have definitely been changed when you inspect them carefully you can see the hair gel the wax and in my experience some blood which i found when i turned the pillow over asking the reception to changes these is a night mare as they have the classical hotel excuse of cleaners are only available in the mornings sir no fridge very dusty the cleaners literally clean it so quick that upon a glance it looks clean but when you spend minutes you can see how dirty the place really is not recommendable at all
