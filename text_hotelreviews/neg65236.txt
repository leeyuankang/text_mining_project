the air conditioning and heating in the room didnt work and the room was like a sauna the whole time we were there even though we complained twice to reception and they said twice they would mend it and nothing happened couldn t even just turn it off cant open a window yourself and have to get them to open and close it but the location of the dlr made it impossible to leave it open at night
