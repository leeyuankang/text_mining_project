no fruit was available to take away at breakfast as i only have coffee it would have been nice to take away a piece of fruit for later in morning seeing as i paid for it the bathroom tiles were a little stained and the plug did not fit in bath so water would not stay in could not sleep as very noisy and we were on floor so did not expect so much noise
