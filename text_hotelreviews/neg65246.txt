the room temperature was degrees on arrival we turned the aircon heating down and made our way out for the evening when we returned the temperature had gone to degrees we again turned it down and hours later woke up as it had again gone up again clearly not working when asking staff how to turn it down due to serious uncomfortable heat in the room was told they didn t know how to windows were bolted so we couldn t open them clean hotel facilities obviously not great wouldn t pay full price to stay again
