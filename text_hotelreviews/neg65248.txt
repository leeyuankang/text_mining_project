prior to our arrival we upgraded to and executive suit on finding our room we were disappointed the beds were pushed together wallpaper and draw were hanging off stains on everything wall curtains wallpaper no heating we complained on the friday night our complaint was apparently logged spoke to the manager when we left who clearly just wanted to get rid of us dispite being told to write our complaint in an email our complaint has never been actioned to add insult to injury we then found our hotel room for sale at a reduced rate of nearly not a pleasent experience
