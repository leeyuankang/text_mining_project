the service was really poor it was london marathon weekend and the hotel was completely unprepared for the volume of people had to wait hours to get seated at the restaurant then another hour for our food which was ice cold the whole building is in need of a revamp very expensive weekend for a terrible experience i have stayed in many hotels in my life and never gave a bad review ever before the fact that i am now just underlines how terrible the experience really was from everyone i would never recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i have already warned so many to never stay there a shame really as it is in a perfect location it does need a completely new management system really as we could see that the culture of the hotel is one where they do not care well not on the weekend we were there
