strange decor it is made to look like an old classical hotel maybe century with tassels and chintz etc but it is clearly a modern building in canary wharf now that the decor is all getting a bit worn at the edges it just looks tired and old fashioned most of the sockets in the room were old style round pin sockets so we had to share the only available normal socket for all of our chargers
