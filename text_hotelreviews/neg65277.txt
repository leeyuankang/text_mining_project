checked in they gave me the key once i went to the room i went to bathroom two minutes later there was a knock on my door three staff members saying i need to leave when i asked why they said we don t need a reason to ask anyone to leave i did nothing wrong i was in my room for minutes maximum it seemed they were treating me like i did something wrong or discriminating this overall interpreted my event for the day as i had to change hotel last minute and now thinking of doing an official complaint towards the staff as it was out of order
