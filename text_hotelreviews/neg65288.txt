the state of the hotel in general was very poor the windows in the bar were rusty and needed replacing the room was a total state and not updated for decades no doubt the bathroom was disgusting and i could not call down in the morning to order breakfast to my room as the room phone was dead and i did not have time to go and eat due to needing to be out early for a conference i will never stay there again
