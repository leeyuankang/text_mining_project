the room was certainly one of the older un renovated rooms located which meant were woken up at to the sound of building work in the room next door yes unbelievable but they put us in a room where the wall was being stripped in the room next door to our room that woke us both up at the room itself was very dirty and on arriving back from a night out at and getting into bed it was clear that my sheets had not been washed since the last person stayed there they smelt of dried sweat and the bed was covered with hairs unfortunately in the morning i was unable to have a shower because the shower was broken with either extremely hot water or ice cold i complained in the morning to pascal languila duty manager and i was told there was nothing that could be done and i had to write to the head office the entire experience ruined our entire break i have travelled all over the world and start in hotels and hostels in many parts of asia and have never complained about a hotel before but this is by far the worst i ve ever stayed in i have complained to the head office and have not had any response
