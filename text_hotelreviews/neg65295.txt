the girl behind the bar was so miserable i would say she verged on being rude obviously didn t want to be working on a friday night breakfast at a cost of per person i couldn t eat it the bacon tasted of pure grease the sausages were rock solid and the scrambled eggs could have passed for porridge i asked for a poached egg and was told it would take to minutes as its not on the menu coffee already on the tables in a flask you couldn t drink this if you were desperate when i arrived i was told i had to sit on the left of the dining room would be nice to choose where you sit like an adult the staff in the breakfast room were also very ignorant everything was simply too much trouble reminded me of eating at butlins many years ago i stay in hotels a lot and in particular london but haven t stayed at canary warf before i assumed it would be a little upmarket and couldn t believe the price the foyer is beautiful the room was bit although a little run down which is fine but the staff really do spoil this hotel
