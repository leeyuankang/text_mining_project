the rooms was very small the carpets had really seen better days and the worse thing was the noise coming from the conditioners outside my window it woke me up every couple of hours do take ear plugs with you the hotel generally is a little worn down it probably used be a good star about years ago but is now no more than star i should think it s fine for a short business stay but not the most romantic or comfortable place for a longer stay
