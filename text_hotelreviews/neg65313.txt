when we first arrived the room was baking hot we tried to turn on the air con but it only seemed to make the room even hotter eventually i had to go down to reception and ask a concierge to open the window for me as they are locked and cannot be opened by hotel guests during the night i hardly got a wink of sleep with the window open the room was still far too hot and was now coupled with the sound of dlr trains roaring past the window from the wee hours of the morning it wasn t just the sound but the reverberations from the train line seemed to make the whole building shake very hostile environment to try and sleep in on handing our keys into reception we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay or if there had been any problems i guess they rely exclusively on online surveys now
