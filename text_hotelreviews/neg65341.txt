i was put in a smoking room as i requested and ofcourse a smokig room may sometimes slightly smell of smoke but this room was filthy it stunk and it was just a massive dissapointment from a normally amazing hotel i also had to wait at the back door for somebody to open it for minutes as the front entrance was shut this wasnt late at night it was around pm
