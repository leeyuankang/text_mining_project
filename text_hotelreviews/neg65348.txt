the entrance feels like a goods in area at a supermarket and not very pedestrian friendly i often had to walk around coaches delivery vehicles and rubbish trucks to get to where i was going i d expect a doorman to greet me at the door and help me i wouldn t expect this at a discount hotel but it would seem appropriate for a hotel like this only lifts serving floors meant there was significant waiting times during peak hours made worse by the staff using them to transport cleaning karts further restricting capacity slight smell of damp in the bathroom didn t leave a welcoming feel when walking into the room there was no minibar in the room i don t normally use the minibar but as i arrived late on a sunday night all the shops and eateries were closed the surrounding area is undergoing a lot of building work which at times could be a little noisy
