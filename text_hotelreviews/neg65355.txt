the whole place was very run down and in need of a serious make over the room was dated and had black marks on the walls the windows were very dirty the shower was nothing more than a hot drip unless you added cold water then noise from the dlr staff not particularly bothered there was a mix up with our booking and they could no decide who was at fault them or booking com so upgraded us to an executive i would hate to see what our original room looked like they even tried to give us another room which belonged to another guest because it had a combination of my friend and i s names
