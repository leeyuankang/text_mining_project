it s a rather tired hotel and the parking is per day which is huge worse still is that you only get minutes free wifi after which there is a charge of per day the swimming pool isn t free for guests yes you guessed it there s a charge the bed wasn t great springs felt through old mattress and decor was abysmal really naff miserly number of tea bags and the box of tissues has just a couple left in it the whole experience is like ryanair you get the absolute minimum and customer service is not what this place is about will definitely not be returning as a premier inn would have been better
