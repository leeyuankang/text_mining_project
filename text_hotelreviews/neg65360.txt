the room was not as clean as we would ve liked stains on carpet and chair upholstery there was no possibility of fresh air to the room ie no opening windows and it was consistently too hot so that we had to have the air conditioning on hours but this was ineffective the self service breakfast was plentiful but average eg flasks of hot water provided for making tea a pot made with boiling water would be preferable heavily diluted orange juice and stale croissants
