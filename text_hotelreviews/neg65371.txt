the room smelt of cigarette smoke uncomfortable mattress on the bed you could feel the springs i d booked a room without a window so as to be in a quieter location but turned out to be a room with a window overlooking the dlr so very noisy very frustrating that most of the sockets in the room were round pin ones so there was only one usable plug for charging phones etc staff on leaving didn t even bother to ask whether everything had been ok with the stay not great value for money overall for the same price you d have got a comfier and probably quieter bed at a travelodge or similar
