unfortunately my partner was kept awake all night due the dlr this is something that can t be helped i understand but we had no warning of this upon arrival the lady on reception was foreign which is fine but my partner had to repeat the simple name of scott several times and had to remind her several times that we were paying by cash the process in general took a really long time with her
