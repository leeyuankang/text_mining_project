breakfast was really not worth the money i chose to go out for breakfast the day even tho i paid for it on the hotel i wonder if you have checked it out yourself the scrambled eggs were taistless i wonder how you managed to even remove the egg taist same with the boiled eggs when the yellow inside the egg turns blue it is because they are more than done in general i have to say your breakfast was the worst i have ever had on any hotels i have been to which is quite a few i didnt like when i revervated and gave my creditcard credentials that when i get there the fee has gone up with what is equivalent with pounds you need to lock the price when a customer reservate a room so i dont hve to pay more than what was my initial agreement
