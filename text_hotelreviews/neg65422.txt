the spa we were told that the last entry was at and ended at but in fact it closed at pm and the other half hour was to get you out of the spa you should be more specific about this the swimming pool tiles along the top part of the water were very dirty and needed a good clean i think that the steam room thermostat was broken as it was so hot that you couldn t stay in there for more than a couple of minutes and the only sauna that i have been to that doesn t have a drinking fountain i had to go through spa reception to the gym to get water leaving a trail of water behind me finally you should get your staff to smile just a little bit
