it took me quite a while to find the hotel at the start but once i found it it was so easy to find again when i first arrived there was a blonde receptionist and she was very rude to me and unhelpful but the other staff were lovely in my room there was air conditioning but it was set to a particular setting and it was far too hot in the evenings the room would get quite clammy which wasn t nice but overall would stay again
