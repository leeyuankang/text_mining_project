i was sexually harrassed in the lobby of the hotel on my way to the hotel gym an unsightly man wearing a baseball cap and gold tooth seated on the couch who was not staying in the hotel hissed at me when i walked by he was not staying in the hotel and had made his way in there and was reclining on the couch i went to the front desk and i had to ask they call management to remove him they were very slow and a bit of a careless attitude like they were used to this they asked me to go to the gym and they would take care of him and i insisted to wait to see him removed they were very slow to act the guy came out and confronted me and we had an exchange of words while the manager was standing in front of me proper management should have had zero tolerance for harassment and not let it get to that level and not let him the guy speak to me again i was very scared and uncomfortable the hotel is located close to the east end which is not a good neighborhood according to a local friend do not stay in this hotel i do not recommend it
