they messed up my reservation the person that checked me in told me i am able to smoke in my room however i went upstairs and i see a non smoking sign on my door so i went back down to speak about it and they told me its all my fault and they were very rude they seem like they were not very bothered with what i was saying worse hotel i have stayed at would not recommend this to anyone
