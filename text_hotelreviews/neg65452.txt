the only downsize is that the breakfast starts only at am would be great if britannia could reconsider to serve the breakfast at especially when people staying for business reason and want to start their day at the office early also quite poor selection for someone who eats healthy there is no options so going forward if i ever stay i won t book breakfast with my room
