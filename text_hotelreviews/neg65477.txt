i was very much looking forward to spending a great deal of my stay in your spa but unfortunately was very dissapointed on my first visit and did not return visiting my local spa on a daily basis i was really looking forward to what i assumed would be a great relaxing experience the pool was cold so was the jacuzzi the steam room was not working properly and the doorvwas continuously open as the thermostat was apparently broken we really enjoyed the experience of the hotel but this spa let it down big time
