the whole building is tatty and tired the carpets are tapes down in reception lifts are rattled and all the woodwork is scraped back down to wood windows are filthy and the odd shapes room quirky but not in a good way tv on room is placed on an angles wall and the tv so small for the distance you need binoculars as for the pizzeria thick base and not cooked all the way though really disappointed they do have a spa but did not try this so i am unable to comment
