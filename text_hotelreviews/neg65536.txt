this is definitely not a four star hotel dirty toilet stained carpet brown peeling wallpaper v narrow beds heating stayed on all night at degrees no air con the bedroom window wouldn t open we eventually had to call housekeeping at to open it but still no air came in an unattended suitcase left on landing despite me telephoning down for it to be looked at security threat overnight parking is no reduction for residents you pay the same as man on the street crowded breakfast dining room with tatty seats rusty windows unfriendly staff unappetising food fatty undercooked bacon over ripe fruit general poor selection of food and display unfriendly staff treated us as inconvenience rather than guests dirty breakfast table leisure facilities which are not as good as they appear in photos shut at we had not be informed that this would happen when we booked we has specifically booked hotel for spa facility however looking at the murky state of the pool we probably wouldn t have risked entering that or any spa facility they provided for risk of infection we upgraded to an excutive room with the promise of a view and was given a view of a rubbish dump in one direction and a building site in the other photos can be provided but they are not pleasant to look at i did bring all these points up with manager both at the beginning and end of our stay and received a very basic apology i got the feeling that manager felt if i didn t like it bad luck there was no offer of a part refund to compensate for our unpleasant stay i doubt if anything will change it was a very very disappointing stay and i would not stay there again
