everywhere was brown and dull and dark it s so depressing as a guest a lot of the rooms don t have a nice view so have large curtains and sheer netting which is perfectly fine but due to the colour of the furniture etc it doesn t feel like there s enough sunlight you should maximise the potential of the rooms by making them less dreary dark brown is depressing and the rooms just feel really dingy because of this
