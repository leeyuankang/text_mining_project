the hotel is in dire need of renovation my room was shabby and the carpet dirty the bathroom was in a very poor state and the shower woefully inadequate the bed was uncomfortable in the extreme and every spring could be felt through the mattress the walls were paper thin and the noise from the dlr despite the room being on the floor was unbearable making sleep impossible while the trains were running unsurprisingly the staff didn t ask if everything was alright with my stay
