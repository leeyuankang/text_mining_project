the parking space was shocking and expensive the staff was not helpful or accommodating to a guest who is paying a lot of money to stay in the hotel i asked if i could check out hour later and they told me no problem but i needed to pay extra for it i find this ridiculous never happened to me in other hotels of better standard and quality
