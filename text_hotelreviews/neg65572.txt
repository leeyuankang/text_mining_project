very tired decor this place could do with a closure for months and a grand re opening i was given a room that was supposed to be non smoking and had to walk straight back to reception to ask for a swap because somebody had clearly smoked in it when i eventually got swapped admittedly the room i got was bigger but i may as well have slept in the dlr station the train line is ridiculously close to the rooms on one side of the building and the windows are not sound proofed or even double glazed to attempt to rectify the atrocious noise i didn t sleep until the trains stopped which was about given that i had a job interview the next day i was furious about this paying for the night with no breakfast included is also massively taking the mick stay at the premier inn or novotel instead people
