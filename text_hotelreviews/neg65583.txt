i asked for a wake up call at i didn t receive one at all and when i checked out hours later than expected the receptionist simply said oh sorry thanks you re all checked out that didn t go down well when i was late for work the mattress i slept on may as well have been made from bones with a few springs in the middle singularly the most uncomfortable bed of my existence on this planet the free wifi was only available in the lobby of the hotel despite being told the hotel offered free wifi throughout seen as that was floors below me and i would have to wait for the slowest lift in the world that was non existent
