i regularly book hotels around london on a regular basis for clients in this instance i arrived at the hotel to pre pay for my client so he could check in when he arrived unfortunately after being assured that there would be no problems my client arrived and could not check in further more the guy at the front desk was rude and extremely unhelpful and should definitely not be working in a customer based enviroment terrible service and would not recommend this hotel to anyone please avoid at any cost
