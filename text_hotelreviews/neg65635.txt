my room was in a poor state and seemed as though it was just drying out after a bathroom flood the room also had a strong musty odour on the evening of my stay i was unable to order food from the restaurant as i was advised the wait would be at least hours after reporting the problems with my room at thge front desk and being told someone would be up to speak to me no one came up to see me
