for a couple there were only two pieces of coffee sugar and tea bags for an overnight stay the most inconvenient was that after having a bath the tub missed the part to release the plug to drain the water that meant we had to leave the dirty water in the tub obviously it simply made the morning shower impossible it shouldn t have been like that
