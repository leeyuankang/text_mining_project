maybe this hotel has two distinct classes and i was in the below basic some reviews give it a high mark not sure how this is a very tired hotel shabby frayed dim and dingy scuffed worn staff all look like they dread every minute i got a good deal for this area on this website but after my stay i would have been better booking a b b and taking a risk could not be much worse breakfast presentation was extremely poor widows dirty holes in net curtains
