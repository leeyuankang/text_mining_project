the hotel staff tried to pretend that there is no booking through your website until i provided a copy of the booking confirmation i wasn t welcomed well because of the discounted value through booking com the hotel did not care about the daily cleaning of my room plus the keys were given to me in a stapled paper instead of the well known paper pocket and i considered that as disrespect and disvalue to the guest finally the staff never smile or give the feeling of welcome to the guest
