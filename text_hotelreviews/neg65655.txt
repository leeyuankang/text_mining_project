unhelpful staff at reception except the concierge who was very nice when you ask them something you barely get an answer they obviously don t like to work there i found several black hairs and curly hairs in the bat tub i m blonde myself so i jumped out of the bath the moment i noticed them not a good moment for me a shower was also a difficult experience as there is no way with my that i was able to get under the shower as this comes up to my chin the room was freezing cold when i arrived degrees no minibar or at least a big glass for water no free internet and buying a voucher wasnt possible as i kept being thrown out of the tool to buy the voucher breakfast looked like it was there since yesterday at checkout the receptionist tried to make me pay for invoices from other people first if i wouldnt have paid attention i would have spend over for night
