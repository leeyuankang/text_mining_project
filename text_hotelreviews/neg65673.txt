a young woman working at reception was very unreceptive she was cold never smiled even when we were being warm hearted and just didn t seem to care for our presence this caused low score for the staff the twin room we stay in was so loud as there is a huge train station right next to the hotel which rattles through the windows when one pulls in this caused low score for location the windows to the river were incredibly grubby in the restaurant too which brought the mood down
