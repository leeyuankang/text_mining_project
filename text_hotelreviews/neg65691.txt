hotel was ok room was small but was fine for what we wanted staff were ok but didn t make you feel very welcome and seemed more business orientated than leisure never told us about breakfast if we wanted it never told us about the leisure centre never asked if we needed help with anything also we booked a double bed which we got but single mattresses side by side
