the member of staff that i checked in with was extremely curt looked at me as though i was below him very unwelcoming for a hotel of that standard i asked for water to be sent to my room to which i was told i would have to pay for the tray that is ridiculous i have never heard such rubbish in my life i have paid for not just a room but a service and to have to pay extra is ridiculous i have never had to do that in any other hotel i have stayed in that needs to be changed finally you should change your policy on wifi i cannot believe hotels in london charge for wifi when most hotels in europe it is free you should again review this terrible i am extremely disappointed with the hotel and would have expected a lot more
