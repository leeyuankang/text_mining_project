tired old and dark decor lobby was filled with gaudy bronze statues and tired carpet given the area the hotel is located canary wharf it doesn t echo its surroundings when the modern novotel opens across the road they will need to modernise the rooms here quickly additionally i left my luggage with concierge after i checked out and upon returning they had been mixed up with other guests luckily everything was located in the end however this suggests a lack of organisation and commitment to great service finally before we left the hotel there was an incident in the lobby area where water poured through the ceiling alongside light fittings other guests notified the staff of this however the staff were not at all concerned or fazed by the imminent safety risks posed by water and electricity mixing the area was half heartedly cordoned off buckets placed to catch the water in the wrong spots and then everyone went back to work no sense of urgency or surprise regarding this maintainence issue
