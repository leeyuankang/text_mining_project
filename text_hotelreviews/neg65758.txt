this was the worst hotel i stayed since my student days the room was tiny but more importantly in a terrible condition the bedding smelled and i had spread my clothes over the bed to be able to sleep the walls were covered with marks the carpet dirty it took me nearly half an hour to check in even though there was only one or two people ahead of me there is no way this is a star hotel i would seriously question whether it would be classified as a star either very disappointing
