this is the first time to complain and it s a real shame but bed bugs come on you can do better than this i have ugly bug bites the day after staying also the room was very hot and the fan did not work very stuffy and hard to sleep in a staff member bought me a fan which i was appreciative of but was still too stuffy your lifts are also very slow
