first impression of the room was quite nice although you don t have to look hard to see that the d cor is looking a little tired you only get mins free wi fi that s pathetic really compared with other hotels i could get more than that at my railway station worst of all was the experience at breakfast the staff were unwelcoming and apparently unwilling to communicate beyond mumbled replies you couldn t hear the queues were long and slow and down a central aisle next to guests trying to eat their breakfast all the food was around one central service area so whether you wanted hot food cereal or fruit you all joined the same queue so unless you wanted to cut in later you had to get everything together and hope you made it back to your table with everything still in bowls or on plates a lucky few seemed to get hot drinks brought to them others were left to work it out for themselves i m glad i only stayed one night the thought of having to endure another breakfast debacle would have been too much i ve had better experiences at holiday inn
