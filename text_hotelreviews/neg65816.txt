i found the staff on the reception desk quite abrupt at times only giving the information they were asked to provide and going no further room service didn t cope with two of our orders and a breakfast came without jam or fruit and no refund was offered basically coffee and a croissant with five pieces of butter for plus an extra for the room service in the spa the in spa shower was burning people as the cold tap didn t work the restaurants were closing a good half hour on friday and saturday nights before they were advertised to take last orders this left one basic restaurant open which was not delivering star food options overall the staff seemed demoralised and unhappy and i wouldn t be surprised if there is a serious management issue underlining the problems at this hotel it should be a lovely place
