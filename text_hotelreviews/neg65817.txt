this hotel is completely misrepresented this hotel would be lucky to rate star the room had no fridge no safe but for ponds you rent a safe deposit box in the lobby which if you want to access you wait in the general queue the restaurant was closed for dinner on out of nights and they charge pounds to deliver room service the main bar only opened at sporadic times they offered a smoking room which was not available when question about the standard of the hotel the staff responded with a take it or leave it attitude the hotel charges pounds for a taxi to heathrow while a local car company charges pounds i will never book a britannia hotel anywhere ever again the owner must rate his own hotels because there is no way in the wide world this is a star establishment
