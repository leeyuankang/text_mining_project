i d booked a room for people my fellow traveller wasn t with me due to health reasons but i hadn t informed the hotel of this however once i d checked in i d found my room was actually a single bed in a tiny room which was swelteringly hot after an uncomfortable nights sleep i went down to breakfast after upgrading to include breakfast for a whopping i was greeted by the most disgusting breakfast buffet i d seen it was grubby the meat was swimming in fat all of the food was tepid i could only bring myself to have a piece of toast the original victorian fixtures and amazing wooden panelling in the foyer do not make up for the appalling stay i had
