there s a sailing fan in the room making noise the whole night and the staff could not turn it off so i slept in a room with all the noise the room is not suitable for living yet they need to sort out the fan problems in the morning the cleaner began to knock every door no matter u are sleeping or not it was a terrible experience living there
