i am very unhappy with the stay we had here we checked in for a night s sleep and the room was right by the dlr stop so it was really noisy nobody told us this and we only managed to sleep between when the dlr wasn t running my partner tried to get us moved when we checked in but they fobbed us off then i called angrily at and they moved us but the new room was dirty and also noisy awful stay i complained and got nowhere my meeting was a shambles as i was so exhausted at least places like premier inn have the good night guarantee so if you don t sleep they refund your money i asked about this and was fobbed off by the staff at the hotel terrible place dirty noisy rooms and rude unattentive staff
