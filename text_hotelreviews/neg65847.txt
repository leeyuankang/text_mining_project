i had a group of business clients and their rooms were not ready although we booked the night before already so that they could be able to check in very early it was communicated to the hotel as well as the correct dates and they confirmed it by email all in order but nothing was as per the email no changes made and were advise of no shows even after the email confirmation that all is in order the clients were not happy and they were all vip s i looked bad at the end of the day will not use the hotel ever again unless i have no choice
