we ve stayed here twice now and both times the mattresses have been awful we had a twin room the first time and was hoping that the double on the second occasion would be better but sadly not it really does put me off staying here again the last time the lady checking us in was pleasant enough but the first time i found some of them quite rude to other guests generally no one seems bothered about any one or any thing
