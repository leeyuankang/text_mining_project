the room was absolutely freezing i was told the heating was off for the time of the year in the bathroom the hot water tap at the sink wouldn t work and i had to boil some water for a hot shave at am i was wakened by the horrendous sound from an air vent in the ceiling i assumed it would go off after a few minutes but two and a half hours later it was still on it was so loud the tv could only be heard when the volume was at level when i booked out there was no duty manager to complain to i will never return to this hotel
