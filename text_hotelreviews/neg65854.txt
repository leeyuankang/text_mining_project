my flight into heathrow was late and i arrived just before midnight at the hotel having previously booked a single room through the website i hadn t had dinner and was very hungry i was told that the restaurant that was advertised to be open until am had been closed down the advertisements running on the television above the reception still had it as one of it s features i asked whether i could please have a quiet room and the receptionist said i could he didn t say anything else about the room i was a bit shocked when i was given an extremely small room without a window there was an airshaft in the ceiling with a grille and i wondered what it was for at about a m i was awoken by a very loud noise it turned out to be a blast of cold air coming through the airshaft i looked for a button in the room to see whether i could switch it off but there was none it didn t stop and it was so loud that it was impossible to go back to sleep it was unbelievable i told the reception in the morning requesting a reduction in price it was pounds and i was told they could only give reduction i didn t feel that this was adequate and the receptionist said there was nothing that he could do he said i should write an email to customer services i have done this but don t have a reply yet
