the front entrance carpets are filthy and should be replaced it is not the first time i have stayed and the staff at the front desk are miserable and stressed one was hovering and watching and interfereing with the man booking me in and it was clear animosity between them that was really not pleasant to arrive to there was no welcome at all no good evening no conversation it made me feel quite uncomfortable this needs to be addressed rapidly as this is the first impression and several times now i have had the same miserable arrival at this hotel i travel a lot and have never had it anywhere else the rooms are dated and furniture needs a good painting and lightening up
