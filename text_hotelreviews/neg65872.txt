it was not a bad experience but i found it difficult to understand what the staff were saying at the reception desk and i don t know whether they understood me at times also the restaurant said they said it would be a long time before we got served at twelve thirty pm because they had a lot of orders i found this a bit strange at that time of night although the restaurant was due to close in half an hour we went to bed hungry it was not very welcoming
