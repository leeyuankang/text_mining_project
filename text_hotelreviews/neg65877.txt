the room felt grubby so i did not unpack and the carpet felt dirty underfoot the dinning area was old and shabby and the hotel needed an overhaul the food was about average the worst was the dls overground train service which stopped around midnight but started up again around was woken by the train each morning and waiting at night for the train to stop before sleeping would not recommend a visit
