when i arrived the only rooms they offered were smoking couldn t take as i have asthma or room with no window i have claustrophobia so this was disastrous but had no choice then in the morning the fire alarm went off took the fire exit route junk in all the stairwells no exit to the street came into the restaurant and lobby finally able to ask the front desk who said the alarm was a mistake but no one went to tell the poor people standing around in their jams
