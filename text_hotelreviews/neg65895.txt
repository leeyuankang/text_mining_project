breakfast was not the greatest buffet style basic selection ok if you were a coffee drinker pot of coffee on all the tables tea drinkers had to take there cups to the hot water urn and make there own tea bags were beside the urn to save me getting up and down as i did on my first day i made two cups at the same time i did not book breakfast with my hotel booking but on arrival was asked at reception if i would like vouchers at a reduced rate as this was a reasonable saving i got them for the duration of my stay it was the day before i left i realised that there were some places nearby that did breakfast i will know next time
