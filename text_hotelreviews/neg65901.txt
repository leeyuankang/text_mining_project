staff attitude reception staff were very surly especially the member of staff who booked us in after asking for directions we were told just turn right no indication of where to go after turning right out of hotel but didnt persue this as the girl on the front desk the same one who booked us in made it obvious she wasn t interested no toilet roll in room apart from the last few sheets of a used roll we also asked staff in the bar if we could have extra teabags for the room and were told quite curtly go to reception seems the staff need training in customer service this didnt apply to all staff as some were very polite but the ones who were inpolite left a lasting impression of the hotel staff as a whole
