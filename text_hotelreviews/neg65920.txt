i didn t like the way of treating customers especially when the manger called seeking their money for the night i was going to stay with them although i just told one of his staff that i am going to pay for that night after minutes l tried to make joke with him then he said i will get you out of the hotel and that was i think very rude from him to a customer staying with them all in all he is still has to serve his customers well and politely never the less how they react
