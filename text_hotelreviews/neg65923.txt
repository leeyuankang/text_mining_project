i had booked initially a single room and never seen in my whole life a star hotel offering a rudimentary single bed with the room just the size of the bed that s scandalous never thought that room that size existed in any hotel even motels are much more spacious i had to pay extra per night in order to upgrade with a queen bed that s just even more scandalous decor is dramatically old style old fashion not at all the image of brand new canary wharf while i travel a lot i had never seen a hotel where you would pay extra for a late check out that is just by hour check out time was and had to negotiate hard to allow me until as i had an important meeting in the morning before i could check out so disappointing no star stance for sure and no value for money at all definitely overpriced for the basic comfort and bad service expensive hotel rooms which are clearly overvalued and not worth the money
