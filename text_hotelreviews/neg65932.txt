the breakfast was shockingly bad value for money but as there was only a subway nearby we thought it best to have breakfast in the hotel before we left on our travels bacon and hash browns were over cooked only coffee on the table and although the tea was unlimited i had to keep getting up to refill my tiny cup we had dinner twice in the pizzeria during our stay and was very nice indeed still slightly expensive but expected for london on day of checkout the maid entered our room twice while we were getting ready to leave do they not receive a list of room numbers who are checking out that day
