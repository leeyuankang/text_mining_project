there was a bucket in the lobby to catch drips from the ceiling i was forced to pay our stay in advanced because i didn t have my credit card with me and they couldn t use the one i gave booking com for the non refundable reservation i never expected to have to pay anything after making that reservation every morning i wasted to get to the ground floor because one of the lifts wasn t working at breakfast i was handed a dirty cup and the way food was handled made me lose my appetite there were no conveniently placed power plug in the room the wifi was ridiculously expensive
