the standard quality of the property shows that this hotel had its glory days many many years ago very worn not kept up and many things did not even work properly speaker in the elevator kept repeating service service for breakfast one had a choice of buffe or buffe could not even buy a cup of coffee it was all or nothing one friendly waiter took pity on me and gave me a whole thermos for free nice gesture the pool everything made from metal and painted white was rusted and looked terrible and one had to pay for the pool visit i have never experienced that before
