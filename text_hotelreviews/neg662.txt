on my previous visit i had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel when i arrived there was a denial that i had made a booking this was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom i had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the dec days after my original stay however my booking had been made with booking com on the dec so one way or another someone cocked up but i was blamed for the failure in their communication poor show
