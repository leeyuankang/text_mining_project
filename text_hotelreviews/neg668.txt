having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast they told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for not they know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast on the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station we were told minutes to liverpool street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it we had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day the fare quoted was we were charged and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in minutes i have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply very disappointed overall
