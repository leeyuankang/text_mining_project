very expensive would not have stayed except meeting us family at same hotel i trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which i stood on as i got into bed staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning shows room had not been properly cleaned unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair room was tiny and not good value for money
