the private parking only has few spots and almost all of them are for narrow cars our rental fit in it but bigger than a renault clio would have been impossible the area may surprise some as it is not as romantic and picturesque as the city centre but there are many wonderful shops and restaurants for those ready to seek and we walked to champs elysees in minutes we got a standard room which meant affordable but small and viewless
