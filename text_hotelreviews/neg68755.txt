i would totally give this place stars but on my check out the desk staff asked if i needed a taxi i said no i could easily walk outside and catch one of the many that were waiting across the street there is a taxi pick up spot across the street with a line of taxis waiting he said no i will call it is better so i waited and took his taxi my fare to gare de lyon was euro but when i went to pay it he handed me a bill for ten dollars more claiming it was because they had called him to say i was angry is the understatement of the century i thought the manager was being nice turns out he was ripping me off
