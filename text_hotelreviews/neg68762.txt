the room stank of stale cigarette smoke and was very very dark even with all the lights on it was a tiny corner room with a double bed against the wall you could barely open the door all the way because of the bed the bed was uncomfortable and when we looked underneath one of the legs was broken we picked this hotel as it looked like an interesting boutique hotel the view from our window was of a wall and some pipes the room was not soundproof as advertised and there was no dvd player trip was intended to be a romantic break but the room was truly awful
