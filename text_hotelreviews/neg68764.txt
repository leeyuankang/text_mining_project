i am sure they had a shoe polisher previously but when i asked about it the receptionist reacted like i am asking for a magic cookie anyway also they ask you to come down to get the ironing board i think at a hotel they should be bringing it to you otherwise i love the modern rooms and the air conditioning was amazing definitely would go again
