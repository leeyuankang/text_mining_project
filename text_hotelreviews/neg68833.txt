we booked a taxi through the hotel for le bourget we were quoted euros when i queried this on the morning of our journey i was initially told that was price but i asked the reception to double check eventually i was told the price was euros and there had been a mistake hmmmm i would recommend not using the hotel taxi service but asking them for a metered taxi which ironically ended up costing less anyway the rooms could do with an update my room absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke the staff however were very good in this respect changed my room immediately
