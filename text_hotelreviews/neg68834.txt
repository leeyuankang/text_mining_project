the room via booking com was awful drab and smelt of cigarette smoke and puts me off using booking com in future it was clearly the cheapest worst and most depressing room they had on offer i asked to be moved it was that bad which they did the next room was better but still disappointing and below par as compared to the wonderful reviews high rating and glossy hotel photos although the hotel was a bit further out than i wanted i thought it would be worth it as i was hoping for a special romantic weekend with my partner before my work trip began this was all very disappointing the toilet then got blocked the next day so we had to be moved at which point they did upgrade us to a room which did look like the photos on display this was the type of room i expected in the first place and i did not appreciate the rigamarole to get it i will not be staying there again in future and am very apprehensive to use booking com which i have used faithfully for many years
