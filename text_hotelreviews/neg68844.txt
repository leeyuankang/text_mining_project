when hot water was run in our room or the rooms next to ours the room smelt of sewage for the next few hours the walls were paper thin i think we had a locked joining door in our room which meant we could here everything next door resulting in not a lot of sleep staff seemed to come into the room a lot which we didn t understand why we only stayed two nights and they opened the door twice while we were in the room additional to cleaning and leaving the note water from the tap didn t run cold and the shower changed temperatures constantly we only stayed for a quick break and spent barely anytime at the hotel as we were trying to cram everything into a short stay but if we had been there for any longer than nights i would have complained and asked to move rooms
