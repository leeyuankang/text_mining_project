it was very noisy at the property workmen were doing drilling and renovations right outside the breakfast room the sound made us leave rather than enjoy the breakfast offerings because it was so loud the hotel really should have asked the workmen to begin work in that particular area after breakfast service i understand that renovations need to be undertaken but more care should be taken in relation to guest comfort it was disappointing that nothing was listed on the booking com website or the hilton website itself about the renovations taking place
