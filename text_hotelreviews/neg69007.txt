my major problem with this hotel was that the wifi in my room only worked in a small corner close to the door this meant i had to work at the desk and type emails and do my business and then take my laptop and stand in the small corner until all my emails sent and updates were done reception suggested i move to another room but that room was smaller with no work desk and really not what i paid for i specifically chose this hotel because it has a gym nowhere on their website or in the hotel it shows that the gym is out of order but only when i changed and actually went to the gym there was a notice on the door both these issues gave me such a bad impression of hilton euston london
