i paid a lot of money for night to be very dissapointed by the level of noise on sunday morning i knew there was refurbishment going on in the hotel however i didn t know that i would be getting the room right underneath all the drilling and renovating on a sunday to be woken at by drilling was not nice and plus this was a surprise for my other half so i was a little embarrassed if there was a money back guarantee i would be asking for a full refund
