cooked breakfast was poor arriving for breakfast at on a friday morning there were no eggs left no baked beans no bread selection and the bacon had been under the heat lamp that long we couldn t physically cut it with a knife i would expect these basic items to be readily available without having to ask staff i notified reception that morning to receive little interest very disappointing
