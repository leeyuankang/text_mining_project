the bedroom was disappointing it was a disabled room so no bath the work desk didn t have a mirror so drying my hair and putting my makeup on was difficult as the mirror was in the bathroom nowhere near a socket it was also very hot the air con didn t work and there was no extractor fan in the bathroom apart from that the room was very clean and the staff were very helpful
