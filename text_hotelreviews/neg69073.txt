dark room too warm with an early train to europe i was offered a packed breakfast this was not ready and took far too long making me late the staff were most unhelpful the breakfast consisted of an apple an orange a dry roll and a childs fruit drink if that is your standard i hope i never find myself in a hilton hotel ever again again certainly the worst and most expensive hotel in a day rail journey from london to china
