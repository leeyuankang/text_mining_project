well it starts from the extremely dry unwelcoming and somewhat rude front desk staff and the non existing concierge i would have at least expected someone to ask me if i needed help with my bags since i had to deal with of them now after checking in we had to wait for around minutes in a somewhat hot reception to get the service elevator since the other are under renovation everytime it stoped it was full of either staff of workers when we finally reached our floor it smelt like a worksite some airfreshners would have been nice the room itself is nice but was located near an emergency exit that woke us up everytime it slammed when closing later that day after comming back from a walk we were then greeted by boxes almost blocking the hallways and minibars on the floors in front of everyroom this was followed by a maintenance person knocking on my door to check if he could install the fridge may i just point out that he must have been the most polite employee i encountered during my stay as he apologized for the mess and inconvenience anyways im glad i only booked this place for one night i understand hotels renovate and need to work around guest but a few smiles some signs in the service hallways and a bit of courtesy doesn t hurt
