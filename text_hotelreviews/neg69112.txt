the view from our room was of their gymnasium which was being renovated and was basically a construction site see my photo of our view from the deluxe double room there was no natural light in the room there was a problem checking in as they couldn t find my booking even though i d already paid in full took around uncomfortable minutes for them to find my booking about half an hour after i d been in my room two men entered saying that they had the room shocked that they had a key card and were able to open the door very concerned about safety and security after that as a result of all of this i didn t think it was acceptable for over for just two nights
