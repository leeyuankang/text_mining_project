the room we were given had been having problems with the air con temperature but we were given it regardless we didn t know this on arrival we put the temperature down and went out thinking it would be ok when we returned it wasn t we got back at midnight and it was still like a sauna called down and that was when the staff member said they had been having issues he gave us an option of a cool down unit opening the window and lots of fans or we could swap to the only room left in the hotel luckily i was there with my sister and we shared a room with a king size bed but it really was very poor of the hotel to book this room out knowing it was faulty
