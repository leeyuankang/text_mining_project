there is scaffolding around the whole front of the hotel and was still being erected when we got there pending what looks like a good deal of work i feel we should have been advised about this prior to the booking being confirmed and possibly a discount offered considering the potential for disruption the initial room we were given was a single room with a double bed this was promptly changed to a standard double hence the excellent rating for the staff and service level the food also is excellent but the need to use the service lift and ongoing work means the hotel itself is not currently up to the standard i would expect from a hilton in the heart of london with the rates expected
