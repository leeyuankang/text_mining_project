this hotel is currently undergoing a major refurbishment and should be avoided while this is underway the air conditioning had been switched off in my room and although a fan was supplied the room was stuffy and it was difficult to sleep i had to use a service elevator which was still being used for food deliveries etc the front of the building is covered in scaffolding which must raise security and privacy concerns while the refurbishment is under way much better idea to stay in the ambassadors opposite or premier inn round the corner
