the room was so stuffy and it stunk couldn t open a window because the only window was looking into the restaurant had to keep the shutters closed so no one could see me which left the room always dark i didn t know i was paying so much for a single bed the carpet was filthy i didn t want to walk on it without shoes the internet was useless it shut off every minutes and i had to type in the code again i used the internet for probably hours total and had to type in the code about times i thought hilton was supposed to be a decent hotel i was so suprized to have such an uncomfortable stay canadian should get me a lot more considering it wasn t even in a prime location
