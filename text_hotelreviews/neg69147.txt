the hotel was undergoing refurbishment which we were not informed of in advance the bedroom we were allocated was stiflingly hot the window did not open and the air conditioning was not working the view was of builders rubble piled up outside the window we were allocated another room on the fourth floor accessed by a staff lift entered from a tradesman s kitchen with a exposed pipe running water down the sink the dining room was not open we had ordered afternoon tea for five people at for a family celebration we were told that tea was not served until pm despite the website stating it was served from to and pre booking it for the website clearly advertised tea in a very nice looking dining room the staff did their best to accommodate us in the bar area but despite being there for two hours the staff then waited until my husband and i had gone to change before insisting that the tea was signed for by a person staying at the hotel or else paid for my daughter therefore paid for her celebration tea later reimbursed by us of course but that was not the point we were offered a bottle of pinot grigio white wine as recompense when we stated that we were intending to have glasses of sparkling wine in any event to mark her achievements the pinot grigio disappeared and we were charged full price for the five glasses of sparkling wine which was not the best quality in any event that was also on the bill which daughter paid we appreciate that it is difficult whilst renovations take place but the situation should be made clear when booking it was altogether unsatisfactory had we known we would have stayed elsewhere
