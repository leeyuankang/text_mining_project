the hotel had recently been refurbished so there was an overwhelming smell of paint the air conditioning was also not working so the hotel had put makeshift invidiual aircon units in rooms that when used can only be described as a plane taking off the heating was on high and couldnt be adjusted so overall a horrendous night when i complained to the manager the following morning although pleasant enough during his explanation that many people had complained due to the obvious issues the best he could offer me was a reduction on my next stay i decided to take him up on the offer given i needed rooms for my staff for a company function not only did they offer a measely pounds per room but i discovered i could get the rooms for less on booking com needless to say i shant be returning to this mobey grabbing hotel
