really shabby for a hilton i mean to be fair they are undergoing refurbishment but it is hard to believe that a hilton could have ever been in such a poor condition prior to the refurbishment the room was stuffy and smelly smelled like damp clothes and carpet pulled kettle out to make a cup of tea and it was filthy with little black bits on the base the elevator opened up to a really filthy area basically premier inn or worse quality at hilton price
