the hotel was being refurbished while i was there and there was no air conditioning my room was like a sauna and i couldn t sleep with the windows open because of the noise of the traffic outside there was supposed to be bottled water available in each of the rooms and the staff were supposed to leave the curtains closed to keep the temperature down didn t happen in my case
