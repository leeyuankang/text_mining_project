having to sleep in a room with no air con and the only option to compensate this was an air cooler and a fan that was like trying to sleep in a box room with a jet engine impossible to relax watch tv get ready in fact overall enjoy or short stay in london absolute disgrace that this room was sold to us as the hotel was going under a renovation feel conned by both hilton and booking com even more so now that the manager offered us a free up grade on our next visit refused as this was just simply not good enough
