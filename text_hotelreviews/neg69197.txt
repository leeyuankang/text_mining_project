the air conditioning wasn t working and although we had a fan in the room it was boiling hot and we didn t sleep at all the room was tiny you could just about walk past the bed the rooms looked tired and in need of refurbishment there was only one lift working so we spent a lot of time waiting for the lift being on the fourth floor
