being charged for a local telephone call i was having problems with my mobile phone and needed to get onto an important conference call i couldn t believe it when they had that on the bill these price gouging practices are long over in any hotel that really values their customers experience they offered discount so i asked is see the manager and was told i was speaking to the duty manager which explained everything he just didn t get it well he will get this i was just starting to travel to london on a regular basis for business and was looking for a hotel i could stay at regularly i had decided that the millennium hotel would be that hotel not anymore hope the was worth it as you lost a lot more than that for not putting the customer first and being so stubbornly bound by your out of date policies
