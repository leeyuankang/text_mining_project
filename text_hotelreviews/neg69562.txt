disappointing not to all be all placed on the same floor when three rooms booked under one reservation and having made a previous email request that was acknowledged not sure why you would book three rooms then position everyone on separate floors reception failed to tell us about the club facilities we d already paid for at checkin we had breakfast included in our reservation but no mention at booking that it was only continental and not full additional per person which is mis leading times of club facilities are ambiguous and therefore very little food and drink left when we arrived at because we d been given incorrect times the club staff did make an exception and brought us another bottle of prosecco there were of us however this didn t happen willingly and was the club concierge was clearly less than happy a little disappointing
