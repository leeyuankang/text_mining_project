a very pleasant stay until we checked out and were charged pounds for breakfast which was listed as pounds per person on our booking confirmation and by the reception staff on arrival they said it was our fault for not ticking the box when booking to pre order breakfast no such box existed in our booking process nor was there anything in the fine print the staff then blamed us and booking com for the misleading information which they were well aware of and they were arrogant uncompromising and unpleasant the breakfast was ordinary with no orange juice it had run out and no one cared and we had to ask three times to get our tea and coffee a sour end to an otherwise good experience we will not be returning to this place
