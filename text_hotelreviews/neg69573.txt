my double room was small it was hard to walk in the room if you open even small suitcase but since i stayed there alone and just went to sleep then it was ok i stayed there years ago and nothing restored so it is old room and old carpet the hair dryer was old there was not a kettle or teabags complimentary water was there only the first night some lights were not working small details but for the value i paid it wasnt good enough
