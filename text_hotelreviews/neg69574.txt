we were asked if we wanted a newspaper in the morning and said yes although did not realize this was not complimentary and we would not have yes if we had been informed of that so were surprised to find this charged onto our bill at checkout to make matters worse we were asked which paper we wanted but did not actually get the one we asked for i think my husband glanced through it but i did not actually get time to read it although such a little thing it left a slightly bad taste in the mouth
