the club lounge was sorely lacking we had breakfast there twice and saw the host only very briefly and there was no way of contacting her and we did not see the dedicated a la carte menu we went to the lounge on one evening and there was no host at all plenty of mixers but no spirits only red white wine or prosecco and the two canapes were tired at we had breakfast once in the main room and by several things had run out and could not be replaced as there was no more
