the hotel was clearly very busy and booked up when we arrived the first room given was by the lift and made a lot of noise the second room had an interconnecting door the final room looked great room but as it turns out the cleaners room was right next door and they were in and out throughout the night etc with the door banging we had a terrible night of little sleep as a result everything else was fine just noisy cleaners and no sleep so left feeling like we needed a break in a different hotel
