when the hotel says bf is included in the room rate this is quite misleading this is for continental bf at the club room only not for full bf they should be more clear and straight forward the bathroom is small but providing good toiletries hotel staffers are always smiling and talking niceties but when asked for assistance they are slow to react concierge are ignorant at arrival i returned an avis prestige mb se rental car at the concierge according to instruction nothing is done the car stayed on the curb for a few hours and i had to come back a couple times to ask concierge to call ap to pick up the car once done he never bother to inform us i had to reconfirm with ap to make sure they got the car back and after nights when leaving in early morning we ask for a taxi van to lhr it took concierge a different person hr to call a regular taxi to come to hotel which could not accommodate our luggages and while all these taxi vans are passing by in front of hotel so we had to go out on the street in the rain to wave for taxi van by ourselves
