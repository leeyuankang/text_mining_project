the room was tiny too expensive for the rate given they made double hold on my credit card for the full stay which consumed my limit a lot of discussions with them and the bank where i checked out and still in contact with them to release the amount anyways the location is good on sloan street and near harrods and harvey some of the staff were helpful too
