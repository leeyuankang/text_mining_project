it doesn t give a star feeling the place is cheap looking and could use a renovation you can hear it when people come and leave the bathroom has no lock and the door is cheap it s so small too one of our rooms didn t lock properly and you had to really make sure it clicked or else it wouldn t lock the room is super small they call it a twin but the two beds are right by each other as if it s one bed there s no room between the beds even movement is hard when there s two people in the room because of the tights space between the tv area and the foot of the two beds i don t think i d ever stay there if it weren t for the location and for it being cheaper than park tower i hate staying there to be honest it s uncomfortable but i stayed there before and if they continue having better prices i might stay again
