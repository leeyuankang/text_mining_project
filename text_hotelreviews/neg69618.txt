i was feeling a bit hot so i switched on the ac but instead of cool air coming through i got hot air at all ac settings strange the wi fi didn t work on my iphone or my wife s iphone either i stayed only for one night so didn t bother speaking to anyone about it but it might have been nice if it worked straight out of the bag
