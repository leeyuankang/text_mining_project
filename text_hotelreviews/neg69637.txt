the hotel looks rather run down rooms in particular are old some of the lights eg do not work also lack of cleaning staff eg when we came back after our day s outing at about pm our room wasn t even cleaned up yet we realised this is probably the only hotel that doesn t do evening prep up of the room with a couple of night lights on bed prepped up for sleep in also no provision of any complimentary water throughout my periods of stay in this period none of my room was prepped up for sleep in ie i entered a dark room if some of this software can be improved i am sure we will be repeat customers thank you for hearing us merry x mas
