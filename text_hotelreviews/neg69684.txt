everything the staff were not helpful the hotel was dirty none of the services of a hotel so known are convenient worst stay ever i had to go out the whole day and come back for sleep only because i couldn t stand the hotel renewing the hotel would be a good option demolishing it and rebuilding it maybe we had access to the lounge and omg the lounge the worst place ive ever been and i swear im not exaggerating we chose the hotel only because of the location and never expected it to be that bad will never ever recommend it
