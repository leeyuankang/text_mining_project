did not get twin room that booked months before and confirmed with hotel a week prior to visit was given double room and as with my year old son was totally unacceptable had to call the reception staff on occasions to chase up room change and ended up sitting in reception to wait we had to a meeting at a specific time and had to be be showered and changed after our long journey so by the time go into a suitable room had to rush around not happy that had to complain and continue to do so in order to get an appropriate room which i should have been offered straight away as the hotel did not have the room i had booked we were eventually put in a family room which was suitable my point is that should have been given this room in the first place
