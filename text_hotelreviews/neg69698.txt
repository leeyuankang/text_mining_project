the hotel was very dated especially the room we stayed in it was tiny to move around in the bathroom even smaller for the money we paid i feel we were totally missed sold from the photographs we seen prier to the booking this stay was a one off night for me and my husband with out the children and we came away very disappointed with the hotel which saddened our trip the booking also didn t clearly state that breakfast was included when i paid for the hotel
