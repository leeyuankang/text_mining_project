we were so disappointed to have an electrical problem with our room at about at night we were ready for bed and found that we couldn t control the lights all on or all off pitch black in a strange place couldn t phone reception as no info in the room so went down to be told the engineer had just left and we would have to wait until tomorrow however somebody agreed to come and look to cut to the outcome at about we were asked to move rooms and the room was obviously a single comfortable but only facilities for one bedside table robe slippers etc no apologies from anyone we would have expected a little more from a hotel i had stayed there before but maybe not again
