on booking com i was given an option for a smoking room as my partner smokes i thought this would be great as he can relax without having to go outside the hotel to smoke his cigarettes however when we got to the hotel the staff advised us that there was a non smoking policy attached to the hotel although there was a balcony rooms for smokers they told us we would have to pay extra for these rooms but didn t think this was right as the website implied the room i had booked would be fine for my partner to smoke in i would not have booked this hotel at all if i knew that we were not going to be allowed what was requested in our booking all the staff were not very helpful and had very bad attitudes
