the air conditioning in the bedroom was regrettably inefficient with it seeming impossible to cool the room down having a shower curtain over the bath is awful as it wraps itself around you when showering in this day and age a glass screen would be expected or preferably just a good walk in shower rather than a bath baths use far more water and older people struggle to climb in and out this cannot be safe when there is a function above the breakfast room the staff are stretched and are not available to re fill the food trays or drinks containers unfortunately the bedroom carpet and decor in the bedroom lobby rm was very worn i think a refit is due having paid for my room prior to arrival i found it unnecessary for the receptionist to insist on taking my card details again when i wished to pay for any incidentals with cash which i did anyway this came across as very distrusting especially when the receptionist asked if my card would cover the payment for the room and the payment had left my account weeks before we asked for a double bed and were offered either a queen bed or two singles made up as a king size we chose the later hoping it would be bigger but discovered the beds were made up separately and just pushed together
