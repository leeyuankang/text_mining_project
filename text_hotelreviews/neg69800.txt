reception welcome very very unfriendly and almost rude you need to provide the credit card which you used when you made a reservation as it was a present and booked by somebody else we had to pay again while the original payment was cancelled staff was very confrontational and asked to send a form to the person who made the booking to provide all the personal information and copy of the passport etc just unreal also the room was so noisy and the wind rattling through the windows felt we slept outside although we had a sign at the door do no disturb cleaners opened the door at on sunday good we had the chain on as otherwise she he would have just walked in horrible never experienced it before will never stay in this hotel in the future
