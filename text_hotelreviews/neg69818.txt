absolutely appalling experience i booked this hotel for my girlfriend s birthday and was left upset embarrassed and hugely out of pocket i called ahead twice to ensure that a couple of small extras were ready and waiting in our room on arrival for my girlfriend s birthday but they were not most pertinently i was charged twice for my room which led to a funds problem for the rest of the birthday weekend when i explained this on our checkout i was assured that this was not the case well two thirty minute conversations with my bank proved that i had indeed been charged twice which the hotel service manager still belligerently refuses to believe this charming lady condescendingly told me thay they regularly have customers spend far more than i have and that this is standard practice what to charge customers twice and cause mass embarrassment to their paying customers this snapping back chatting and interjecting lady then told me that it was my bank who were lying to me i was incredulous as i type i am still awaiting the promised call email back to confirm that the matter has been rectified and my account recredited nice to see that they don t really feel that christmas is a period where people may need funds and not be charged twice oh did i mention the blocked sink in the cramped bathroom if you take offence to belligerent and argumentative customer service managers and to being charged twice please steer well clear of this particular hotel
