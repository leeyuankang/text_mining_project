it is clear that they are not really set up for on line bookings i would advise not to book in advance i had paid in full months in advance but was forced to to pay in full again and am now waiting for a refund from my original payment the whole thing was handled very badly which is the last thing you want after long hours of travel the room was tiny which i expected but it was made smaller by the fact that some furniture was falling apart i will never stay there again
