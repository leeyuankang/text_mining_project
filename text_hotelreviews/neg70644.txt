the lift was out of order until monday this is saturday the access to the room is via an exterior staircase we were on the floor although this is not the fault of the staff they seemed a little too non apologetic about this the towels and bathrobes could do with some fabric softener breakfast service is correct excellent fresh orange juice but the breakfast itself is disappointing for a hotel this could be really simplified with a decent buffet during the night we could hear people talking in the courtyard despite the double glazing and sound proofing but no big deal it is the centre of paris
