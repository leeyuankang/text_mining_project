the room was quite small but acceptable considering the location but the toilet was abysmal separate from the small bathroom with no wash basin imagine a broom cupboard feet deep with a toilet and there you have it very uncomfortable front desk staff so so female staff on duty early in the morning when we passed through the empty reception area didn t even bother to greet us with a good morning but just continued to speak to each other as if we were invisible
