my room was so small that the head and foot and side of the bed were up against the wall and at feet inches my feet hit the wall on the other end of the bed the bathroom was so small and cramped that you had to tight squeeze yourself between the wall and sink to get to the toilet and when you were on the toilet the sink was in your chest you couldn t stand in front of the toilet at all and it was very uncomfortable and inconvenient for the high rate it was poor value the breakfast was good but the wait staff frequently messes up orders or ignored people or forgot what they were going to get people
