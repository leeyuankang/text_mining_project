unfortunately our first impression of this hotel was a good one but as we got into our room things just did not have the same impression on us the bathroom was really not to a standard at all blinds dirty window with old plants bath panel not finished ceiling dirty generally not a good impression at all we did ask for new light bulb and panel to be sorted and they did try but the overall experience of the bathroom was not good at all
