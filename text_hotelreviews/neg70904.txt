i m not sure how this hotel could get stars as it definitely would not get more than stars from me the customers is king at least that is what they say but the stay made me rather upset than happy first of all the parking situation is a disaster they have a car park where customers pay a day which is not cheap already btw but for this you need a customer card which you obviously get in the hotel if you call in and let them know that you need a parking spot i did so but when i arrived they told me that they didnt get my message so i had to pay a day which is quite heavy besides the rooms did not look like they did on the pictures at all i was literally shocked when i saw the rooms we got it was my first stay in this hotel and there will definitely not be a second one the only good point is that the hotel is pretty central but to be honest this wasnt worth the stress we had when we arrived we came a long way from germany and the only thing we wanted was to relax but that was sadly not possible instead of relaxing and calming down i was even more stressed sorry to say that this hotel ruined my stay in paris
