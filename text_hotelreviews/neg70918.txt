everything the room is so small and old fashioned the toilet is separate from the bathroom the worst thing is there is no sink to wash your hands in the toilet there was no kettle to boil water for a cup of tea there were no cups and only two glasses in the bathroom if you want to drink water you have to buy from the hotel then there was still no glasses to drink from there is only switch to control all the lights if you switch off you switch off all the lights include down lights we have to leave the lights on so we did not sleep well
