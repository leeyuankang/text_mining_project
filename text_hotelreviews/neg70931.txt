the staff was not very helpful in the reception i requested an invoice at my husbund s name and they denied because the reservation was at my name i changed that in booking com and they still issued an invoice at my name having no intention to facilitate me plus for returning customers they should have a data base we have stayed in bedford more than times and this time they gave us a really mediocre room i m not asking for an upgrade but in all hotels returning customers that visit again and again the same hotels happen to have some privileges or some better renovated rooms especially when reservation was made more than months before arrival
