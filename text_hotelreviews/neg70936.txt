i stayed a lot of times in this hotel because the location is the best it is though really odd how they do not have a data base for returning customers as this time they gave us a room of poor quality non renovated with poor bedcovers and four pillows for people they shoud be two per each it would be really a pity for a hotel with such good and polite stuff not to have the possibility to locate customers that visit again and again and offer some benefits such as a better room type or even an upgrade
