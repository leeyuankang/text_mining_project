i never complain about staff but reception in bedford did not attend us very well in check in looked like he was bothered just to be in there in check out we were previously authorized to leave by m instead of normal check out hour but one attendant kept repeatedly calling us to leave the room by really unnecessary once we got a late check out other people from staff were really nice to us
