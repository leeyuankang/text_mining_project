we were disappointed that the hotel did not offer dinner in the evening there was a lunch menu but this could only be taken in the bar area such a waste of a lovely dining room the towels and bedding at the hotel were less than one would expect at a four star hotel no duvet which we usually expect in continental hotels and poor quality towels
