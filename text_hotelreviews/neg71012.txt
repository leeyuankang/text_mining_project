no drinking water offered for free in the room no kettle in the room even star hotels offer at least a small bottle of water and there is a possibility to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room with no extra charge for it after a long day outside this was missed when returning to the room no iron personally i think the price was too high for the the way the rooms where furnished i expected more of the hotel rooms look better on the pictures then in real i have seen two rooms during the stay my friend s and mine my room was nicer cosiness was missed it smelled paint in the corridors the breakfast was poor the hotel is actually quite nice my opinion is given according to the price paid way to high for the quality provided
