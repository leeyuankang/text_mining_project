carpet was very old with stains we booked a bedroom suite thought that it would have a kitchenette or at least a few small appliances like a tea kettle or a coffee maker but it had no such thing since we were travelling with a baby it was very important for us the suite we had was next to a construction zone the construction related noise in the morning was unbearable the staff should have warned us or moved to another suite
