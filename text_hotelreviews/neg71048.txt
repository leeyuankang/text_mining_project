the hotel is really overpriced it is not a star hotel the room smells of dirty the carpet was full of spots and is was really disgusting in the rooms the facilities were old fashion and needs renovation the room is small the breakfast was awful for the rate of the hotel the cleaning lady was cleaning the next room at a m which i think is unacceptable the beds were not comfortable and there was a repair work early in the morning so we could nt sleep at all as we complained on the reception we were told it is not coming from our hotel but we saw the boys next to our room the airconditioner was not working properly the wifi connection was very bad we were really dissapoined at the end when we were leaving we asked for a taxi and with all the kids and the staff we were waiting the car for minutes it was really a disappointed stay
