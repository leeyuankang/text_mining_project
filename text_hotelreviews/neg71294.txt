the place is good to stay located in the old neighbourhood of montparnasse but i found the staff not so friendly i had arrived early morning and i had already requested for early check in but that did not happen and i can understand that there might be an unavailability of room but then i had requested to contact the property via booking com multiple times since i wanted to extend another night at the hotel and even then novotel never got in touch with me it was a difficult experience managing this hotel
