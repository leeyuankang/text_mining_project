on may i called to borrow a hairdryer since the one in the room was not working i also asked if i could borrow an iron the lady staff in the front desk told me that they were too busy to bring those items to our room so i must get them downstairs i did because as i said the hairdryer in the room was not working in the lobby beside the front desk the bespactled front desk lady staff gave me the huge ironing board the iron and the hair drier which i carried myself and brought to our room located at the end of the hallway how we treat our guests is a very important part of our overall experience guests stay in a hotel with a mindset that their needs will be catered to and also expect that people tending to them will exude a certain level of joy in serving you we are paying for our stay and for their services and that was the first impression i got i have stayed in so many hotels around the world and it was my first time to be treated this way the sink in our bathroom was draining so slow almost clogged but i did not bother to raise my concern because of how cold the staff treated me on our first day of stay i will never recommend this hotel to anyone and i will never book with them ever it was the worst hotel experience i got
