we requested to have our two rooms on the same floor since they were not we were reassigned only not giving us the same amenities the room was on the back side of the building and the sound from outdoors with windows closed was terrible we could hear a woman voice making announcements etc we did not like that breakfasts were not included they did give us two breakfasts but we lost money on the reassignment
