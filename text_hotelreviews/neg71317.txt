i did not like the location i booked it because it said it was really close to the eiffel tower like a minute walk or something however it was not it was very far more like a walk there wasn t that much around the hotel it was on a very quiet street just a few restaurants around the corner everything else was really nice the hotel and the rooms were really modern looking and very clean very comfortable
