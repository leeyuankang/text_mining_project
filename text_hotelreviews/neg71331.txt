the toilet overflowed which can happen to anyone but they did not deal with it in an effective manner i brought the problem to their attention at as sewer was overflowing in the room and by it was not addressed it was after midnight when we were given a new room the room was for three persons and the beds were only dressed for they also provided no towels shocking experience when i spoke to the night manager he took no responsibility and blamed the day manager for not addressing the problem
