if we had to give a minus point it would be for the prices of food and drink in the restaurant and bar when we arrived we just wanted a snack and was shocked when we looked at the prices we didn t want to look rude so we ordered portions of fries at this would have doubled if we would have ordered cokes for drink i suppose they have to get their money back on the free room mini bars from somewhere to be fair this was the norm for all over paris we thought prices were going to be on par with london and we were wrong it was very hot and we were shocked to have to pay or more everytime we had a drink roughly every hour
