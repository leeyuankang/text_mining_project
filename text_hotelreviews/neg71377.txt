breakfast area is small comparing to the amount of people making the place very crouded the bed headboard in my room broke in the middle of the night creating relevant noise and waking me up carpet smelled quite bad mini bar fridge in the room turns off so it has no use when mentioned all of the above to the receptionist she didnt care at all and she was quite rude and didn t try to assist except to repair the bed no apology was expressed at any time and checked out the next day very disappointed
