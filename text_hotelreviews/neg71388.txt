on checking in i asked if i could upgrade to a suite i was told they weren t available but i could have an executive room including minibar and dressing gown neither of which i would use so i declined but later realised i was being charged for after complaining i was given a euro a night discount not good enough don t employ staff at the front desk if they are not fluent in understanding and speaking english but it was a great hotel
