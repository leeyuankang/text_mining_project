this hotel is almost brilliant but left disappointed sent message with booking stating arrival time hot day and got lost arrived hours late was told room was ready went up to room and it had not been cleaned from last guests after mins was told we had been upgraded room was tiny but amazing on first impression lights on ceiling and floor space age loo funky paint and lights however mirror lights remote control one bedside light hairdryer all broken minibar prices were truly ridiculous for a little pot of nuts for a coke loo door creaked so loud i had to leave open to avoid waking partner and i would have lived with the rest with only minor irritation but they disabled the aircon at night it was degrees in our room at when i awoke in a sweat the little book in the room had english and french pages for everything but the aircon page where the french page was duplicated such a shame could be a great place declic if you read this get a delivery to room deal with a local food drink place and step up your maintenance
