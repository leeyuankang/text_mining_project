for breakfast seems expensive but i haven t tried it rooms are small even the superior double room especially unfortunate is the lack of shelves in the bathroom you are left with only a few cm space on the sink to put your stuff on and otherwise you are reduced to keep your things on the floor or in the room itself even in the shower there s no shelf to put the shower products on which is very inconvenient
