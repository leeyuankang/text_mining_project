basically let down by housekeeping and room size rooms are not big enough for families although advertised as such often used glasses and trash were not removed random number of towels each day no room service despite having a room service menu they answered the phone but said nothing was doable so we gave up and the room was over heated not helped by four people in a very small room hairdryer didn t work and safe ran out of power locking our valuables irretrievably inside until it was re charged
