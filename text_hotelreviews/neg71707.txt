once i arrived back around midnight i wanted to make the most of the hour room service i was hung up on twice once the phone was answered the girl on the other end was so rude i was told room service would be and hour before i even ordered i was then told nothing s available she could and i quote do me a mozzarella and pickle panini but this would be an hour and twenty and she was adamant there was a tray charge before anything else and then she hung up disgraceful service and it ruined my whole stay i was in an executive room which average at best
