the room was far too hot and airless the air conditioning was ineffective and noisy it did not respond to wanting the room at degrees the water glasses were not washed or changed strange arrangement of a separate toilet but no hand washing facilities so had to go around to the bathroom not very convenient or hygenic no grab rails in the bathroom the beds were not as comfortable as expected for this type of hotel not as priceworthy as hoped
