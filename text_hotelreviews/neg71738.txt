overall a very disappointing experience the hotel gave us the vibe that they were running a factory rather than a hotel the hotel doesn t place much value on the customer experience although the place wasn t bad per se there was nothing special about the hotel or its service even on the smallest level the place was disappointing such as really cheap sand paper like toilet paper in the bathroom and no moisturiser it also felt that the hotel had no respect for its customers such as being required to pay for your room service on the spot rather than charging to the room room service wasn t even brought into the room it was handed to me at the front door and the food was very average at most hotels it is a nice experience when staff wheel the food in when you stay with your partner it makes the evening special to be honest in all the years of ordering room service in hotels i have never had someone just hand me a tray at the front door very disappointing why did we waste our hard earned money on such a dull experience overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is after a special night if you are a business person and you just want a bed then maybe it will meet your needs but i would recommend purchasing your own toilet paper and eating out we went there for a romantic evening the hotel didn t make any effort to make our night feel special despite paying for a deluxe room
