we booked the room to go on an expat coach tour a departure this appears to be a regular pickup point provides guests for the hotel there is no facility to get an adequate and early breakfast for these guest we were offered a take away breakfast that included a cookie this seemed an expensive and inadequate option we bought yoghurt from the supermarket this seems to be a significant oversight by the hotel
