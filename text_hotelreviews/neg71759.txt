the room wasn t made up properly prior to our arrival i had asked for the sofa bed to be made up for our son this wasn t done as a consequence my husband had to assist the receptionist to make up the bed as a result there weren t enough towels and toiletries however this was quickly remedied once pointed out there seems to have been some cut backs since our last visit as a result the stay wasn t as enjoyable as it had been in the past
