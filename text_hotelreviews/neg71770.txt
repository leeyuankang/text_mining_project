we are a healthy active couple and were given a room for handicapped people that is ok but in this case the height of everything from sink basins mirrors to hanging space was too low the carpet had significant cigarette burns in many places which made it unpleasant so much for a non smoking room no sofa lounge so little comfort compared with the good novotel room we had in southampton on the previous night
