overall we like the hotel and think the personel have a nice attitude on the downside it is rather strange and not very hygienic with how they have separated the toilet from the shower and bath facilities due to the toilet lacking a sink to wash yourself you have try not to think of all the places in between the toilet and the shower room where people might have put their hands on the way to having them washed
