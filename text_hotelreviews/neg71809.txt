the lack of parking was terrible we drove to the hotel after a show at the after previously being told by a member of staff we could double park we got back to find there was no space for us and was told to use a pay and display minutes walk this was not acceptable and at first the staff did not seem to be bothered until we put our foot down and ended up double parking behind another guest the car park must of fitted about cars there we aren t from the area and did not feel safe parking anywhere insecure not good if we were disabled and after a long day walking did not fancy another long walk after leaving our car in the middle of nowhere
