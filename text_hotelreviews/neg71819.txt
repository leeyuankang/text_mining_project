i did not like that there was no dresser chest of drawers to unpack my clothes i was only able to hang up my coats in the small closet would have liked even just a couple of drawers to store my clothes in so i didn t have to live out of my suitcase the ice machine did not work on a few of the floors but that was only a minor inconvenience
