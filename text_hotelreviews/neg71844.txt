i asked for a room at the front rather than the back because of the noise from the railway i believe this necessitated the hotel making a change in room allocation the room i was given at the front had a very unpleasant looking large dark stain in the carpet i pointed this out to the front desk when i was leaving the next morning it s not a room that should have been given to anyone and surely the housekeeper should have been informed prior to my notifying the front desk
