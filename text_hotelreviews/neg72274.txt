appalling hotel they may have low rates but it is for a reason i had to leave and find another hotel after my first night the club room one of their best rooms was tiny the location is not great with the noise of a very busy road all night the staff were nonsensical and failed to mention that there had been a power cut and that i would have no hot water it wasn t until i called down having stepped into a freezing cold shower that they said yes we are aware there is no hot water what sort of service is that i tried to get my money back with no luck as it was a non refundable booking through booking com very frustrated with the whole experience i have learned never to be fooled by the photos and read reviews before you book
