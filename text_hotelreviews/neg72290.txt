our room was across the street and then down into the basement our view from our window was bricks and a big steel vent pipe we could hear the underground trains and the noise from above was ridiculous the room was so dark the lights had to be turned on as soon as we entered the fire exit green light was broken so at night the whole room lite up green the breakfast was cold and the young lady in the restaurant was useless we constantly had to ask for items to be refilled or replenished
