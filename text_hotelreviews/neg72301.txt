i ve stayed there many times so clearly i like the place and its conveniency the staff were helpful but they did put me in the basement the first night as i was staying there for nights i asked them to please move me up to higher floor and a bigger room they did the next day and i was thankful staying in that basement room for nights would ve been so depressing vacuum cleaning the floors was not that good but hey i can be very clean sometimes they had a complementary bottle of water the first day but the rest of the days they didn t replace the old bottle with a new one
