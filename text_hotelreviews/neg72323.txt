overall a good stay in a clean hotel with a great location staff were friendly only gripe is that the staff wouldn t upgrade me to a room with a double bed for the same price even though it was at night and no one was going to be staying in the larger room anyway they weren t empowered to make any decisions had to keep checking rates prices what they could and couldn t offer on their screen don t like a computer says no set up
