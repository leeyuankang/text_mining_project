the hotel uses a building across the road to house some of the guests this is where i was put the porter helped me with my bags up flights of stairs but those stairs were narrow steep and covered in dirty carpet in my opinion it did not feel like i was staying in a hotel it felt like i was staying in someone s house i was on the floor and my room was located in an alcove with other rooms the room was fine basic very small and clean surfaces however the carpet was in bad need for replacing i was staying in room but as a woman staying on her own i felt less secure here than i would have in a traditional hotel layout i didn t raise this concern to hotel reception as i was in a hurry to get to a conference and just had time to get changed before i had to leave by the time i returned it was late and i just wanted to get to bed fast i have to acknowledge that there is a buzzer system to get into the building for security purposes but there was no one manning the entrance like most hotels i was travelling for business so my costs were covered but if i had to pay the cost myself i would have been very disappointed and i think you can certainly get much more for your money in london
