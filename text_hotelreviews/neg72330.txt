the check in desk and rooms were in different locations check in is across the street so it was a tad confusing when trying to check in our room was also not very clean there were unknown substances on all of the curtains and floor the walls were also paper thin and we could hear everything that was happening in the other rooms the shower bath tub was nice but very skinny which made it difficult to stand in the shower
