payment terms i booked for my boss and had requested to process all payments by visa details that i had provided during the booking process in the meantime hotel contacted me to fill out form for visa approval i do understand their point as i did not send the form as requested and they were not going to allow mr andres in the room whilst he arrived in the middle of the night and staff gave him a really hard time to this and in fact we will not consider using this hotel again would have expected a better service since he had already made use of this hotel previously so i thought this issue could have waited till the next morning where i could send the form filled in or else even drop me an email to remind me to fill it out so definitely service is not good at all
