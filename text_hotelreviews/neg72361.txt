the room was in a town house and on the ground floor very odd but the worst was yet to come when we got back late and tried to sleep every vehicle that went past rumbled past loudly and we could feel the vibration of each one we didn t get any sleep what so ever and left feeling shattered which ruined the next day in london we weren t asked about our stay when we checked out either it was not a hotel but a collections of townhouses not at all what i was hoping for
