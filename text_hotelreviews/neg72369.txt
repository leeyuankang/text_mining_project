the hotel claims to be a and charges everything accordingly only because rooms have recently been refurbished the staff tries hard to cope with the situation but absence of an elevator of air conditioning and refrigerators in the rooms absence of some aeration system in the bathrooms are undeniable facts not to mention dirty window panes and pathetic breakfast on arrival we were given a luxury twin room in the basement of the building accross the street atrociously claustrophobic and suffocant as the window opened only a few inches and literally opened on the garbage dump i found it absolutely unacceptable and told so to the manager the next day they moved us to the third floor but it was a traumatic experience altogether definitely not recommendable
