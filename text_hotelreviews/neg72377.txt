the size of the room for the price you pay may disappoint those who prefer a bit of space to stretch out but is entirely practical if you weigh up the advantage of having good local facilities i would also recommend special requesting a room on a lower floor if you have any legs or fitness related issues with no lift walking up relatively steep stairs to the third floor is a task even for the able bodied of us all in all these are intended as recommendations for the more particular customer and are far from outright complaints
