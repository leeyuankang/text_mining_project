there are some green and red led lights from fire alarm etc in the room which can not be switched off this means the room is never completely dark at night even if the heavy curtains do shut out the light from outside in fact this means that the room is so well lit at night that i was able to find my way around f e to go to the bathroom without ever having to turn the actual lights on personally i did not mind this at all because sleep comes easy to me either way but i can see how it might irk a more light sensitive guest
