on arrival to our room we found there were black hairs on our bed sheets which was not the best first impression we also found the shower to drain really slowly so if you have a shower for more than minutes it started to leak onto the floor it was hard to get a good sleep as there are many pigeons outside your window from making a lot of noise lastly we went out for around hours on our first day stopping here and once we came back our room was not clean we phoned reception to see why this was and they weren t particularly helpful but the room was eventually cleaned an hour later
