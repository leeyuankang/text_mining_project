breakfast was a bit of a shambles we went down at only to find no cups on the tables no glasses no bread and very little hot food we asked the staff who told us all the cups and glasses were being cleaned we then waited an inordinate amount of time for a glass and even longer for a cup when the cups were brought out they were immediately packed away in the cupboard rather than brought to us i would not recommend having breakfast here
