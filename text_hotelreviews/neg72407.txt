staff not very friendly or went out of their way but dealt with us we were led across the street by making us run out onto a busy road breakfast is in fact not complimentary as was stated and very basic not worth room was really nicely decorated and lovely bed was so comfy the room was amazing and so was the wifi just those little details that need fine tuning to make it a great hotel worth for nights
