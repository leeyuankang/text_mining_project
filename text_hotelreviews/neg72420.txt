after asking not to get one of the rooms downstairs during my booking they still put me in one of them and it is horrible it is in a building on the other side of the street the room was very smelly and dark it is right under the stairs so also very loud rooms are small and the view of this one was basically right to the air conditioning machine running every literally in front of the window very annoying and loud the windows were not helping at all so you have to keep the curtains closed showers were not very clean and also one of them was broken water leaking when people upstairs would take their shower they changed me on the second day to another room upstairs floor but it was still very loud because of the air conditioning girls at the reception are helpful and nice but this hotel is not a hotel and i would most definitely not recommend it
