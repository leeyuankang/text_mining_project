breakfast was so so staff wasn t quite helpful a girl in the restaurant couldn t speak english and seemed not to understand anything what guests were telling her grilled tomatoes at breakfast were boiled not grilled tastes disgusting in my opinion my friends booked a single room and the room was so tiny that it couldn t even fit in people in there double rooms are bit better because there is more space
