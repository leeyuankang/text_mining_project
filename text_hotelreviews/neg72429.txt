the reception staff were very cold and not particularly welcoming they were better once we checked out as they were different employees but the welcome was not warm at all and they didn t even ask how we were they forgot milk with our tea and coffee arrangement so i had to call about them bringing some up and then they took minutes to do so and therefore we only had two sips of tea before we checked out of the room the next day if i m paying i expect a decent cup of tea in the morning the bed dipped in the middle slightly so my partner and i felt like we were falling into each other
