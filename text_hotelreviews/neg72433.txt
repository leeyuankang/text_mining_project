there was blood on my pillow upon arrival fridge and phone was broken and i had to ring down three times overall for them to send someone up we were left with no towels after they cleaned the room the tv had a universal remote and subtitles were stuck on the screen as we were unable to turn them off the staff were unprofessional and lacked basic customer service skills no room around the bed so we had to get changed in front of the door
