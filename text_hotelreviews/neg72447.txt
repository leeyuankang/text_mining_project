very small room the room is tiny i wish i had of listened to earlier reviews as the pictures are very deceiving it was dusty and only had four coat hangers for people the room wasn t cleaned properly each day and rubbish was left in the room you couldn t get out of the bed with out bumping into the wardrobes or desk lighting really dark especially when getting ready and doing make up was on the other side of the road to reception and main hotel fine for us but wouldn t have been happy if i was on my own definitely over priced
