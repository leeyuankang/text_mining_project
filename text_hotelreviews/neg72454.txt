i was in a building over the road from the reception and although the phone lines connected you to the main building when i returned from an event that evening as a woman on my own it felt very unsafe just walking in to the doorway when you walk in to s hotel reception immediately you feel safe i felt very unsafe walking in to this unmarked door there was no warning about not staying in another building given the receptionist was too busy trying to flog the use of some phone i was also on the top floor and had to climb sets of stairs as there was no lift i had bags and luggage with me and no one assisted the carpet all the waybill the stairs was grubby looking and the room was grubby too it just did not warrant the amount of money it charged also it is very misleading that it calls itself park ave baker street it is not on baker street
