that the staff did not handle the early fire alarm well enough luckily i knew to get out straight away but we were left with no information some other guests clearly stayed in their rooms when we were not given confirmation of a false alarm the staff didn t know how to turn it off and unfortunately that meant well over an hour of not being able to get to my room the whole point of me travelling late the night before was so i didn t have to get up too early to catch my train from birmingham really unfortunate as i didn t have a decent stay
