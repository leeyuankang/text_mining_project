just a couple of small things that make the stay less enjoyable and the communication irritating i found i had to say the same thing about five times regarding our wish to upgrade the reservation from one person to two difficulty in changing reservation from single to double through booking com and could not phone direct to london from canada to explain new costs and options were not clear at any point until signing the final bill communication was very difficult both in email and when we arrived i stayed alone at the hotel on june and tried to explain in person that we would like to have one room for the final four days of our stay but still that request was not processed when we arrived june every day the room should be vacuumed but it was not as i found threads and items on the floor every day new clean glasses should be provided and i think that the refreshment tray refilled to include the cookies and the bottled water or there should be a nice polite sign to explain that bottled water is only offered at the beginning of the stay we paid to move from single to double expected but we had to pay a penalty to remain in the same room double to twin of pounds for a club rate which we did not understand as the rates and options were not clearly presented it would seem that having a twin would have been a preferable for us as cousins not as a partner relationsip we agreed to stay in our room to avoid having to pack up and move but wish after the fact that we had done so to save pounds fee and to have the refreshment tray fully replenished for a new reservation the breakfast buffet is not my choice and not worth the additional pounds i would not recommend it
