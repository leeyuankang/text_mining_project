check in was slow and room wasn t ready on time which was an inconvience there were other couples waiting on rooms also at the time which isn t ideal when your on a short trip and time is limited rooms should be ready by the specified time also a cleaner attempted to come into our room prior to check out time on our morning of departure which isn t good enough especially when we were late checking in in the first instance
