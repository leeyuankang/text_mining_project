we had booked a deluxe double and were given a basement room which was very damp and smelled the room was so small we could barely walk around the bed this was definitely not deluxe the window would not open and there was no phone signal which was a problem as my mother in law was in hospital and we needed to be contactable we were given another room after complaining
