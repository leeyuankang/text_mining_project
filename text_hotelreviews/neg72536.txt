you always have to ask for extra hangers and if you are staying for one night or whole month you just get one complimentary bottle of water i think giving a complimentary bottle of water for every night stay would be more fair even if the bottles were smaller in size this trip the room small fridge was not cold enough but the hotel changed it in a few days and promised they will change all the fridges in the near future
