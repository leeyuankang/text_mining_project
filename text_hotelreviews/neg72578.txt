not exactly a room with a view as it was in the basement of the hotel s extension away from the main building and reception desk i felt somewhat unsafe being in a building without any hotel personnel available specifically as the rooms are quite noisy and our neighbours started their own little party at a m the windows could not be opened with makes it somewhat claustrofobic given the fact that the view was only a wall on meter distance really annoying however was the green light in the ceiling which could not be turned off as we were told it is for safety reasons but which lit up the entire room in green at night i know at least one person who would immediately leave this hotel for that reason
