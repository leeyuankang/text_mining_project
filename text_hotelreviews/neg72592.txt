the room was very small and a little tight for people the entrance of the hotel was opened in the evening and didn t feel secure as anyone could have walked in it is advertised as stars and i am not convinced that it is despite the fact that it is a lovely place it feels more like a guest house than an hotel for the way the place is set up and the feeling in the place i think it is worth highlighting that there is no elevator and the stair case is pretty narrow and steep being young and fit i absolutely didn t mind but i was thinking of other people that might find it an issue a green emergency light in the room makes it impossible to sleep in the dark last detail the shower was blocked and didn t close properly as a consequence you had to be extremely fast to not have the water running over the shower and soaking the place
