one night during the stay i called the same number also for asking a question this time was another person answered my call and he was very very rude he hung up my first call before i finished my first sentence i thought it might not be intentional at first so i called him the second time then i heard he said that if i called the number again he would call the police how could you say that before you listen to me and know why i called you
