room very warm and one was unable to override the preset temperature to reduce rather hot than cold though room cleaning nearby was noisy hoovering etc promptly from which woke me earlier than may have otherwise reception kindly agreed a later check out without quibble and a free mini bar was a nice touch too overall a very pleasant stay in a friendly hotel
