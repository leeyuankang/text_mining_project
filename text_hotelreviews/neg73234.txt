we did have a bit of an issue with room service i requested two sandwiches on the saturday night after a long day sight seeing it was so didn t want a big meal the restaurant manager refused this and informed us we could only have food off the al la carte menu this seem ridiculous that they would make us a full steak dinner but not a sandwich we expressed our dismay to the receptionist who totally agreed and rectified the situation we were served with fabulous sandwiches and fries they deducted the service delivery charge and of the cost
