i generally like this hotel mainly for its location and comfy beds but what i really don t like is all the banter plastered around almost every surface which i find slightly patronising and dated it s the sort of thing you expect on virgin trains dare to be different on the bathroom mirror etc etc ugh also the place could do with a lick of paint here and there otherwise it s nice
