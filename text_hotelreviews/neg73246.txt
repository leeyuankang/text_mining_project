staff were very poor took them a while to understand what we wanted at check in queues to check out delays in breakfast orders very rigid in relation to what we could order for breakfast ie you can only have the breakfast exactly as outlined in the menu rather than what the customer would actually like bar staff cleaning up around you in the resident s bar did not make it feel comfortable or welcoming expensive hotel for this level of service
