the clarity on the booking com website my booking says this is a non refundable booking which indicated to me that i had paid when i booked nowhere in anything to do with my booking can i see that it says i need to take the card with me or that payment had not been taken i used a work card to book as it was a business trip and did not have the card with me of course i therefore have had to pay and will now have to seek a refund from my place of work this not only caused me embarrassment it was quite stressful as i did not have all my cards with me either i d like to know how i was supposed to know that payment had not been taken and that i would have needed the card to be with me please thank you
