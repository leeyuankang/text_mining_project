whilst we were there a film crew were shooting a short film under normal circumstances that would have been exciting however with all of the film equipment and crew being stationed right outside our room it made it very inconvenient and noisy the crew really didn t give much respect to the patrons of the hotel at all when mentioning this to the staff of the hotel they also really couldn t have given much concern to our complaint a little more training to all the foreign staff could go a long way
