there was a movie being filmed at the hotel which delayed our checkout a bit but nothing major when asking to book a taxi you will get a private car service that doesn t accept credit cards when we asked to simply be ordered a normal taxi as we had not cash left on our last morning the lady at reception said that couldn t be done obviously they get a kick back from the car company but frustrating the customer s needs didn t come first
