there was a bad smell in the bathroom that i suspect came from drains i didn t notice it at first but it deteriorated as the night went on i was only there for one night so i didn t follow up i m sure it could have been sorted if i had spoken to them but i was too busy to do that lighting in the bedroom was a little dim for writing and reading
