constant issue with me is the fine details in hotels this is not a cheap hotel by any means bathroom was not as clean as it should be toilet was dirty and shower was not clean as it should be remember there are strangers sharing after each other cleanliness is therefor a huge pre requisite oh and does tiny little milk cartons provide a coffee i checked into my room early afternoon used the milk and when i returned and got up in the morning no milk
