i ordered room service food and unfortunately received a lobster risotto instead of the mushroom risotto i had ordered i am vegetarian and also have a food intolerance to seafood so i spent most of the night with an upset stomach and in the bathroom i informed the reception twice of my predicament i was not offered any reduction on my food bill and i had to pay an extortionate amount for a lobster dish that i ate two spoonfuls of and that ruined my visit i have since attempted to contact the hotel three times once through email a second time through booking com and a third time through email again i have not received a response to any of my communications extremely poor customer service
