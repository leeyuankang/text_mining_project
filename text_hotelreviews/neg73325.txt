regarding cleanliness the bed linens and bathroom were very clean so this was not a problem at all but there were many stains on the carpet which seemed not to have been changed for quite some time i had booked a standard room i was offered an upgrade for about it made the check in a very commercial process while i had room upgrades for free in many other hotel chains
