for the price i paid i was expecting to have a foam mattress bed not spring topped with foam clean carpets ironed curtains i was also so surprised to see that the paid breakfast consisted only of cold eats like cereal pastries fruits and yogurts if you wanted a warm breakfast you had to pay extra considering the sheer amount of star hotels in london i d never go back to this one
