having stayed at malmaison london on two previous occasions i booked this confidently knowing that myself and my partner have always had a brilliant experience the extremely poor service from the front reception staff and duty manager during this stay has meant that i will never be returning with regards to the room it was extremely cramped and small and in need of some repairs as the curtain fixture was broken and the shower didn t work properly
