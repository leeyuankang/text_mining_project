breakfast is overpriced we rated cleanliness so low due to the fact that just upon arrival we went to the bar which is also the restaurant for some cocktails and there was a mouse running all over the place the staff apologised and said that they would deal with it and we did not see it for breakfast however that is not according to the standards of a four star boutique hotel
