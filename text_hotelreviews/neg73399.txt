i don t know what a mature couple is but we are in our late there was non stop loud pumping music in the lobby which we found annoying it s probably an occupational hazard for the receptionists noise pollution the penny pinching was a turn off since it s not a budget hotel for example they asked us to pay when we wanted a minute late check out i think it would be much better for their reputation to say that the room was not available they also marked their shampoo as the best shampoo you re ever going to steal humor i don t get i found it cheap
