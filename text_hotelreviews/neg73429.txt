the cleaning staff were very quick to do their job the first morning we woke up we thought we heard someone knock the door at and she kept knocking and walked straight in as doing so honestly not giving you enough time to put your clothes on and clearly didn t hear us shout not to come in quite embarrassing for my husband and myself was also quite suprised the hotel supplied the rooms with goose feathered pillows although many people would find this a luxury i suffer from allergies and asthmatic in which i react to if come into contact with it s quite common with goose or duck feathers it s not something i thought i would need to mention as most hotels to date will just supply hypo allergenic pillow and duvets to cover all types of allergies the hotel was kind enough to switch the duvet for me after i realised but by then it was to late i had reacted and i was uncomfortable the rest of the stay
