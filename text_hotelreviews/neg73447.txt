the staff were very friendly and offered all services of the hotel and made me feel very welcome however after going to the room i was initially booked in to i found two occupants already in there i obviously went back to reception and made the staff aware and they offered their apologies and sent me to another room the room itself was nice with well enough space for a single occupant as i was when i visited with a large comfortable bed and big television the floor however had quite a few hairs and bits of dust i only noticed because i was barefoot and the base of the shower had a very noticeable amount of limescale around the brim in the hotels defence this may have been because they weren t expecting anyone to be occupying the room that day still i wasn t exactly pleased with the quality a small thing i noticed was there were two items missing from the minibar this was actually a little disappointing as i felt i wasn t offered everything available from the hotel the final cherry on top of my disappointment was the construction taking place right outside the building obviously it is beyond the hotels control but still i had gone there to relax and was unable to without turning the volume up on my tv quite loud i am sure the hotel would have provided me with another room if i had asked but to be honest i just wanted to relax at that point after travelling all day
