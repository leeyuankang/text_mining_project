i ve stayed here a few times in the past and generally liked it however the recently renovated decor of the rooms is somewhat akin to a teenage boy s bedroom or bachelor flat and terribly dark definitely not a romantic vibe at all all a bit too urban and try hard awoke to building works right outside our window not such a great night s sleep
