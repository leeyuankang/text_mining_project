if you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel the glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty nearly all the guests we came across we re british but there was a complete lack of english breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast what made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast the hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast
