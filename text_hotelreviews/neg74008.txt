i booked one night in a triple suite for my wife s birthday and just to make sure i was happy with the room i attended the hotel a week before our stay rm allocated but when we arrived on the day we had been moved to another room that wasn t as nice when i politely complained we were offered another room which was even worse finally after some hard negotiation we got back the room was but no breakfast included i agreed to pay the pp but when we went downstairs we were ignored initially by staff chatting to each other the price only covered a cold buffet continental and did not include a cooked breakfast which was an extra i really think breakfast should be included considering the price of the room but at the very least surely should cover anything you want like most other hotels we ve stayed in the ambiance of the basement restaurant was a little oppressive so coupled with the pricing we decided to eat out i would emphasise that we had a lovely and comfortable stay but the breakfast situation was really disappointing and considering the quality of the hotel it was rather stingy
