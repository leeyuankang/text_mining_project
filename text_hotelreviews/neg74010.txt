reception clerk mr redzoan is a liar and wouldn t take responsibility for his actions before the hotel s reservation centre i enquired about the possibility of changing my reservation but clearly it wasn t worth it so i decided to keep it as it was mr redzoan knew this he was standing in front of me with booking com on the phone when we all agreed to keep the reservation as it was still they considered it changed and charged me more than on my credit card without my authorization and that was for one night at the reception they simply said contact our reservation centre tomorrow monday the reservation centre never replied my email fortunately booking com did the right thing and reimbursed me i hope they got their money back from this hotel and i hope they penalized the hotel be careful don t trust this hotel
