i m pretty surprised at the score for this hotel location is very good for london but otherwise the place is a typical characterless impassive not very well maintained average london hotel very impersonal desk staff not rude at all but not welcoming either bad level of room maintenance towel rails sagging out of walls on loose screws faulty toilet flush really hot room with poor temperature control shame with a little extra effort the place could actually become quite good
