there was a bad smell that lingered around the stairs and bathroom area both nights of our stay not there during the day our electric sockets didn t work the first morning maintenance soon sorted a faulty kettle so i asked for some hot water to be sent to our room so i could make tea the hot water never arrived but they did replace the kettle our room was fine other than the smell coming from the bathroom drain but our friends next door had some slats missing broken from the sofa bed
