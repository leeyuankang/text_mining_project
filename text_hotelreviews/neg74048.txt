i thought that it was a bit overpriced for what it was i have ordered a plate and knife upon arrival and the receptionist forgot to bring it to me so i had to call them again the room itself was very small and the ceiling was dirty the windows wouldn t open enough and the room was either too warm or too cold there were not enough towels either in my opinion there were no slippers and no robes which i thought was very odd the duvet was a bit too small for the size of the bed there were not enough hangers for two people the mini bar only had two complimentary bottles of water but no snacks or small alcoholic beverages the room also seemed a bit dark the drains in the sink and tub wouldn t let the water run down properly which i thought was a bit gross since no one wants to stand in a pool of soapy water when they re taking a shower
