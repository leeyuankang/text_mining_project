we notice straight away that the bathroom was a wet room and we didn t think it would be an issue but later on the night i had a shower to find the room steamed up straight away which meant when you came out the shower it was very hard to dry yourself because of all of the steam we tried looking for a fan to put on when we were in the shower but there wasn t one this is something that needs to be looked into we also couldn t find a room manual on where everything was and what was in the room which also meant that the room was very very cold in the morning even with the heating full on by the third day i ask a member of staff about the heating and they did sort it but the room only stayed hot for minutes and then a fan came on to cool the room down it is winter at the end of the day not summer we are lucky we come from scotland where it is colder than london another we didn t like about the hotel is the fact it was all malaysian food which isn t to our taste and we wouldn t have stayed here if we knew this before we booked and this wasn t clear when we booked this hotel we always had to make sure we had eaten before heading back to the hotel as for breakfast it was a total rip off for a continental breakfast and the food wasn t even fresh i wouldn t recommend the breakfast here i would eat out if you find somewhere nice
