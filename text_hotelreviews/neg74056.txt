the room was extremely hot when we asked the hotel staff about the air conditioning and why it was blowing out warm air when set to cold we were told by a very rude member of staff that because it was winter we had no option about the temperature and would have to live with it being too hot not comfortable to sleep when it is that warm also bathroom had no fan so by the time the first person had a shower all the surfaces were soaking wet with condensation and was far too hot
