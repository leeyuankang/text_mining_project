if you are the type of tourist that walks a lot to save transportation money this hotel is not for you i did not have any other food choice beside the hotel restaurant and the room service i personally feel that the location is not as good as advertised yes it is next to the river thames but there is really nowhere to eat shop nearby i would not mind walking minutes to the city center to get some food but we have to remember the saying it s always raining in england twenty minutes of walk under the rain can get very uncomfortable but to be fair there was a big construction surrounding the building so some restaurants shops might be closed during my stay
