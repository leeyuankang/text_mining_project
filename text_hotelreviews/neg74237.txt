no robes in deluxe double room a bit shabby scratches on floor from sofa bed marks on the sofa looked like chocolate no curtains up on rails just lining ones the porter knocked on our room twice with bags that were not ours and we had room service knock at am with breakfast we did not order even tho we had the dnd sign lit up we had a problem in the bar with ordering but this was resolved by the manager oh and we did order room service when we got back from our night out i went to leave a tip on the charge only to be sniped at and told no no not on there the hotel just gets it there were some cleaning issues but as we had to wait for our room i take it they were pushed so we put up with a few hairs in the bath we used the shower and called for tea bags as we only had green tea i feel some of your staff let you down with there attitude in an otherwise beautiful hotel
