we travelled from australia and spent a total of days at this hotel in the beginning and seven at the end of the holiday we had trouble with house keeping in the first six days room not attended too after being out all day and so no tea to make a cuppa before bed when we went to book out after the first six days i asked the member of staff we dealt with would it be possible to have a river view for the seven days on our return but she curtly replied not on your deal the last seven days three of which had no house keeping at all until my husband spoke to a very nice gentleman on the desk would we stay here again no would we recommend this hotel no when along way from home one needs to be a guest in a hotel that appreciates their patrons
