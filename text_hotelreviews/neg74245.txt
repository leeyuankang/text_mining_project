since the room was facing the inner yard there was a lot of noice from the airconditioning compressors on the roof assumption it is very noisy if you open the window to let some fresh air in otherwise one has to rely only on the room ac and i am not certain if it is designed to supply fresh air or if it is only circulating the room air
