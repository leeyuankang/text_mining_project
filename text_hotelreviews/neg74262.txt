the hotel was beautiful but several satisfactory variables downplayed our experience the location was fairly akward to get to in regards to public transportation the view of the room we we allocated was terrible myself and partner were placed in a room where we faced the next building in development construction i specifically booked this hotel becasue it was by the riverbank and hoped to enjoy the view i look forward to booking other stays at park plaza locations and strongly believe this is a one time situation
