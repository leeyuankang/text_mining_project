service in the restaurant was mixed they seemed to have a lot of new people working there the system for breakfast seemed disorganised in particular the process for ordering eggs was not apparent on the first day and then they took a long time coming with the rest of the breakfast going cold before they arrived we thought this hotel was very overpriced in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at in london some of the staff were friendly but mostly the team were not overly friendly
