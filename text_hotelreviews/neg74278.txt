the fact that they charge you the entire amount at check in plus euros blocked for any additional costs complete lack of trust especially vis a vis someone who has stayed there for business several times before and is a member of their loyalty club the check in desk was attended by trainees who did not know what type of card can be used to pay guarantee the payment and messed up the processing of the payments i spent a lot of my time on the phone with my credit card company and at the reception desk to sort things out and never received a proper apology for what was a mistake of the reception desk personnel and errors in their system i also found that cleaning services could be significantly improved i agree with other reviewers who consider that the hotel lacks personality the personnel is not genuinely nice and it seems that there are perpetual renovations works in the hotel and around it in my view not worth the price although i have to return for work in the area where is the hotel i will find other accommodation
