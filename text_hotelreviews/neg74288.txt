unfortunately i would say that unless you are on a business trip with a lot of money to spend it might not be for you very expensive for a basic package our room had a smell of sewerage in it which at times was very over powering our towels when we arrived had holes in them and were all tattered when we ordered room service even though items were listed as available for room service we were told that they weren t then when it arrived we paid the full amount and more only for the staff member to call to them room again saying we under paid on one occasion we went to the bar which at we were told was closed and they asked us to go to the executive lounge and we can have a drink there when we ordered our drink there we were charged a room service fee as the drinks had to be brought from the bar which is ridiculous then a member of staff told us we would have to leave as we were not paying for the use of the executive lounge which was embarrassing as other guests were looking at us even though he would not have known whether we paid for the use of the lounge or not he just assumed plus we had been told to use the lounge as the bar was closed to top it all off we were constantly looked at by the hotel staff as if we did not have the right to be in the hotel whenever we would walk past reception we were given judging looks by the staff which made me feel uncomfortable unless you are a wealthy business person i would not recommend staying here also when we booked the room we were told there would be deposit required but when we arrived they wanted which again is ridiculous
