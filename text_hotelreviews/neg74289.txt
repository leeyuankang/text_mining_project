my only issue was the fact that when payment for the room was taking it was taking twice apparently due to an error i had mentioned this several times to the staff to them saying that it will be sorted and refunded in the next hours it is near a week since payment was taking out off my account and it is still to be refunded i spoke to my bank about this during my stay and they told me to ask the hotel to get in contact with them so this can be sorted right away however the hotel did not do this and said everything was sorted
