we booked an executive room which was not ready when we arrived had to wait for one hour they should make more of an effort for the executive rooms last night we had already checked out and wanted to get something to eat at the bar we were told by the bar staff the kitchen is closed and there is no way to order anything only room service went to the concierge to get our bags and ask again about food were told we can order room service in our room which was a bit patronising as we had just mentioned we had already checked out he said there is no way to order any food then i heard the receptionist tell a guest that she can go to the bar and they can order room service no problem and eat at the bar when i told her what the other staff had told me she was a bit embarrased and said they should have said yes for almost euro a night i expected much more
