vauxhall is becoming a popular modern area after hundreds of years of being tacky and dangerous the rumor was the usa embassy is moving to this neighborhood that accounts for all the riverside condo high rises by the hotel hopefully this means there will be more restaurants and pubs in the hotel area now one must walk minutes downriver towards the london eye for eating places the hotel is a ten minute walk to the tube station which is also a rail road station and can be confusing the hotel restaurant was fine for breakfast and room service but not a place we d care to eat a real meal taxi rides to west end theatre were nerve racking because of traffic the tube was faster if any criticism can be levelled at the hotel it is just too modern no english charm whatsoever the gym was inadequate for such a high priced star hotel
