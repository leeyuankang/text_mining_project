on arrival we had to wait quite a bit and due to some of our foreign friends not appreciating the art of queuing we kept getting cast aside there should have perhaps been more staff on reception as there were only two although there were desks in total however this didn t impact my overall experience of the hotel as naturally sometimes there are just busier spurts and that can t be helped
