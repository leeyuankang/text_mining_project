i ve stayed at this hotel several times over the last eight years but after this time i won t be going back the expansion of the hotel impacted on the quality in my opinion several things really impacted for me we paid for valet parking car was left on double yellow lines and we nearly got a ticket unnecessarily stressful with zero apology from the doorman who told us just to drive off even though it was their fault breakfast very bog standard and not worth per head appalling check out system i m heavily pregnant and queued for ten mins at very busy reception then when next in line and about to be served at the desk was approached by staff member with ipad to help us check out except she couldn t refund the unspent part of the deposit so we lost our place in the queue and couldn t check us out so inefficient i d been queuing for twenty mins in boiling hot reception by then and felt awful no acknowledgment of this very disappointing
