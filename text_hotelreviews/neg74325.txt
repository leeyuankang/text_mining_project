the bed was surprisingly hard like one step up from sleeping on the floor the good news is that the hotel staff are instantly responsive they sent staff with a memory foam topper which they put on the bed for the rest of my stay and resolved the issue the room lighting and ac controls from a little panel by the door and the bed which is a nice idea but i found a little wonky for some reason the panel by my bed would light up randomly in the middle of the night and was quite bright also the ac was broken when i arrived as with the bed they sent someone up to my room immediately when i reported it and he fixed it within minutes
