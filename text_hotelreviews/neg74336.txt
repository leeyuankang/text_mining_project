most of the staff were unfriendly and because there was a lot if different staff for different things they kept sending u to different people in response to your questions and had very little english people working for them there was a fire alarm just as we were leaving and it was very unorganised as very poor communication from the staff a lot not sure what they were ment to do then and all the time as someone who worked in hotels for years and stayed in lot over the years i wasn t impressed with the effect running and welcoming of this hotel won t be recommending it or returning
