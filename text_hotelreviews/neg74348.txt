the room was a disgrace i got told i ll have to pay an extra charge incase i decide to us the mini bar fine that s perfect until i got to the room to find out i didn t even have a minibar in there then i looked at my bank statement and i got charged did i mishear something somewhere then it gets worse the light in the wardrobe didn t work let alone the huge dent that was in the bin and a nasty smell was in the shower room it smelt like a body was rotting in the drain my boyfriend and i went and complained on the first night and was told nothing could be done about the smell and that we will have the mini bar light working and a change of bin done the next day which then i come back to the hotel to see nothing was done so my boyfriend complained again and we was given free breakfast and a change of rooms bearing in mind this was our last night there was no point in changing rooms for a hotel in london i was disgraced by the low standard of my room i am very well out raged that we was even sold that room clearly it was not inspected before i arrived i personally think staying in a travellodge hotel would have been better it was a waste of money and time i ll never be coming here again nor will i be telling my friends to come here
