i ordered room service at approximately pm the lady replied that it would take half an hour it never arrived when i contacted staff by telephone i was told that an order had never been placed i said not to bother anyway as we were very tired and it was about one and a half hours after the request very disappointed by this the facility did not materialize communication error on your part but not mine i teach young people hospitality and customer service this was a good example for them of a bad experience
