check in was from we were told there was not a room available when we arrived at so to give it minutes we went back at gone and still were told our room wasnt ready considering the price of the room i expect the room to be ready for this was very poor especially as we had a dinner booked in central london for and then had to rush to get ready to make sure we were on time having then been given a room it was not clean there was mouldy bread and old milk in one of the drawers i am assuming from the guests before clearly the room had not been cleaned properly there was also no hair dryer there was building work below our room we were on the floor that we were not informed about upon arrival and the work started around waking us up the fire alarm going off the previous night didnt help ensure a relaxing stay overall we were very dissapointed with this hotel especially considering the price i have never felt the need to write a review before but due to how dissapointed we are with our stay at this hotel i felt the need to share our experience i would not go back to this hotel as there are far better places to stay for the same price
