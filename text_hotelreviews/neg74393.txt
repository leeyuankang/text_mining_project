the wait at check in took quite a while however the staff were apologetic about the length of time we were waiting to get our key the room itself was great however we were placed on the side of the hotel next to building works which was quite loud and disruptive in the morning and there is no parking with the hotel having not been there before we called to ask where was best to park but the information wasn t very helpful in fact we didn t get any information at all apart from their own service in the end we opted to use their own valet service which was great but quite costly
