first impression was fabulous doorman to take your luggage huge lit walls wide entry all smoke and mirrors concierge were happy and helpful check in staff not so much they couldn t find our booking and offered us a drink at the bar while they contacted booking com and said they would call us after mins and no call i went to the desk to be told our room was ready it wasn t it was being made up when we opened the door no explanation for the delay bar staff were inefficient and all for show air con was too hot and took all night to cool other small things that were neglected first time i ve not been happy with a hotel that i ve booked through booking com
