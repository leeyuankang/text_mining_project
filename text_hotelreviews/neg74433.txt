around april a c full blast when entering the room tried to switch it to heating mode to no avail we had since been told that the hotel had the heating turned off temperature outside at night was after complaining the staff gave us a ridiculous tiny bathroom heater to heat the whole room needless to say this was useless this is the coldest i have ever felt in an hotel room by far
