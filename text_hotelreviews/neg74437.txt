we traveled in a large party with some arriving before others i had booked the rooms on a credit card and as far as i was aware the payment was secure i was very disappointed that the rooms would not be released until the last member of the party arrived with the credit card what was the point in booking and using my card to secure the rooms if guests were not allowed to access them after a long journey from shropshire with one guest being in a wheelchair very disappointing
