bit disappointing compared to other park plazas room was nothing special air con didn t work hairs in bath room was dusty had to ask for additional pillows which were delivered promptly the kettle is in a drawer and you have to plug it in across the room so not very well thought out very meagre supplies of tea and coffee we raised these issues when asked about our stay on check out and were told that housekeeping and maintenance would be informed but the receptionist didn t appear to make any notes so wonder if this will get passed on on check in the receptionist was a bit non plus appeared to be smirking the whole time and didn t seem to care
