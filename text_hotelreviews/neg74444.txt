the sound of the in room ventilation air con was very loud and made it difficult to sleep i would have prefered to have been able to open the window for ventilation but it was wired shut which i m assuming is due to the construction site next door also my towels were changed daily which i did not request and which did not fit with the policy notice in the bathroom this is not an environmental practice
