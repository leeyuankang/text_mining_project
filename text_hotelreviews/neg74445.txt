the first thing at check in was asking for a deposit for the whole sum for the two nights i intended to stay and gbp extra for the minibar gbp for the minibar where else does a hotel ask for such a horrendous deposit sum for the minibar then i went into my booked superior room and started to search for the superiority i couldn t find any one day later the clerk confirmed me that all ordinary rooms are called superior the view from my window couldn t be better it went to the scaffolding of the neighbouring building not further than cca m away from my window the bathroom it s nice but the tub is mounted with the backrest under the sink shelf the breakfast ordinary not bad but very very expensive gbp for a plain breakfast which you get wherever in europe for moreover if you would like to order an omelette it s not included in the gbp already paid you have to pay another gbp the location there is no pub no restaurant no other venue for going out in the evening in a radius of km around the hotel there is only a very very crowded pub in an old boat on the river bank and the very expensive restaurant of the hotel
