having to pay for one item i used in the mini bar they tried to say i had used two when i hadn t i understand it s london prices but for think everything was expensive and the breakfast was extortionate i think having paid nearly for two nights we may have got even one free bottle of water also think the fact you have to pay upfront for your room expected this and then a night depsoit is pretty bad as it didn t state this anywhere and i could have been relying on that for my weekend away however luckily i wasn t on the sunday we went to the chico latino bar and we were sat waiting minutes from getting there to receiving our drink feel like it s because we weren t a big party so they weren t concentrating on the two of us as much
