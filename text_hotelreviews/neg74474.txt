i reported two faults blocked bathroom sink that took minutes to drain and edge of the curtains was hanging off so light able to come in during early morning the drain problem was very unpleasant and unhygienic with previous guests hairs etc washing out i won t go into any more detail neither fault was fixed between and while we were out i had to speak to reception again the following morning they initially offered a discount then when i laughed they offered this plus a breakfast in the lounge in the end the resolution was okay but what a shame it had to come to that other minor irritations two out of four lifts not working waiter quite snooty and didn t bother to mention that steak comes without potatoes or any sides spoil what should be a very good hotel
