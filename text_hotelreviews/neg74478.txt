i wouldn t choose this hotel for any kind of special occasion again we came for our first wedding anniversary i asked if they do anything for such occasions i got told they had already upgraded our room when in fact that was something we had already paid for why make it sound like it was a favour when in fact it wasn t also told we will get a little something in the room as it is our first wedding anniversary and nothing was put in there not something you ask for if it s not there by that point it had all lost its appeal anyway my husband is highly allergic to feather pillows and we phoned house keeping twice to sort it and they never came once it got way past midnight we got tired of waiting so ended up not using the pillows mattress was uncomfortable so both slept very badly not helped by the fact the pillows weren t changed so could not be used it s a shame as the hotel outside and the lobby looks impressive but the room just was mismatched lacked attention to detail and was a bit bare bathroom was lovely though good size and nicely decorated thankfully the view was lovely and we still enjoyed our anniversary out in london
