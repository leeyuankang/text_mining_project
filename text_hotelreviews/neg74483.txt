the staff were rude unhelpful and disinterested were not interested in the issues we raised at all our mini bar was empty and broke but already changed us for the full content prior to entering the room said they would fill it but grudge was still broke said we had to deal with it and would bring an ice bucket instead kettle broke pressed don t disturb whilst in shower but came in anyway twice we had late checkout but when we returned to the room we were locked out they had cleared us out and put all our stuff in lost property reception made us prove we were who we were to get it back which was difficult as they took all our things this place was a joke and at over for nights it s really not what you expect at all they are not interested because they take payments for everything up front and refund you if you do t use something
