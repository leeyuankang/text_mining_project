reception desk is painfully slow in dealing with customers it took me a very long time to check in as there was a small queue and there were only a few staff working at the desk although the staff are very nice when they do deal with you i didn t manage to check out at all as i was stood waiting for ages and had a train to catch that i missed as a result before i gave up and walked away from an unmanned desk whilst lots of staff chatted in the office behind the desk this was at approx you should have more staff on the desk at all times if you took some of the staff that just stand round saying hello to everyone that passes them then the desk would move quicker no waiting time for somebody to say hello in the lobby but you wait ages at the desk bizarre
