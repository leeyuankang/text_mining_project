we were upgraded to a suite but it had no heating in the bedroom or bathroom it was cold the bathroom also had smelly drains not pleasant the sitting room area was under furnished and the suite overall needed a refurbishment with scuffs on the furniture and badly hung net curtains we did point this out in at check out but no interest from receptionist we have stayed at this hotel a few times and it has declined each visit we won t be back
