i didn t know at the time of booking that the next door building which was very close was having major construction works and unfortunately our bedroom overlooked this and as you would expect the building work started early and woke us up i wouldn t have booked this hotel had i known we were told at the time of booking that we had a partial river view but it was very partial and not worth the mention at the time of booking i also asked whether it would be possible to have a room upgrade as it was my sisters birthday but my request was obviously ignored we skipped breakfast as the price was extortionate each
