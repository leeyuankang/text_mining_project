we had an internal room which unfortunately all of them are situated next to the air conditioning ducts outside they run all the way pas these rooms the noise wasnt unbearable or anything but it was still there and would have been nicer without it however when we mentioned it the hotel were happy to try and move us to a different room so all in all everything was good we declined because we had unpacked everything and were going out
