dust all over the work surfaces booking com did not make it clear at all the the hotel would charge per night for parking and put on our booking that we could get it cheaper which the hotel refused meaning we parked on the street behind which lead to our window getting smashed myself and my partner are well dressed and presentable however young and we re stopped several times and asked to prove we were actually staying at the hotel as it was hotel policy even though other guests were not stoped the bathroom was beautiful but i felt unclean and smelt would only stay here again for the view
