our confirmation said check in from reception advised your room isn t ready yet after standing my ground we were upgraded to a junior suite and got access to our room the room was depressing the lounge area was dull beyond all measure the only soft furnishing was a torn sofa there were screws on the wall where a picture might once have hung but no longer in the bedroom the bedspread appeared to have been thrown on in haste it was lumpy and uneven returning from dinner a security guard waved his hand and demanded room key my wife replied i m sorry and he repeated just room key we appreciate some security checks might be appropriate but so too might be basic courtesy this is no way to treat guests
