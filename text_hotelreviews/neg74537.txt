it seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan the furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason that you did not understand beforehand it seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan the furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason you did not understand beforehand i booked a room via booking for a nights stay as we found that we did not like the hotel very much when we arrived i tried to negotiate with the lady who helped me to do the check in to see if i can use the credit for the third night to upgrade a room and she said probably not working but i could pay an extra pounds for upgrading a room as we were not satisfied with the room type we booked in advance we agreed to pay to upgrade and i paid a deposit of pounds and we left after the second night staying so we only stayed for two nights the lady who helped me to check out asked me if we was not going to stay for the third night i confirmed this and returned the key and she told me the deposit would go back to my card so i expected to have pounds refund i paid for the deposit as we did not stay for the third night but i didn t see it come to my account so i called booking to ask about this and the booking team tried to ask the hotel and negotiate with them but the hotel said as my previous booking was three nights so they also charged the upgrade fee for the third night that s extremely ridiculous as i did not stay for the third night firstly i didn t say i wanted to have a three night upgrade as i have clearly told the lady in the front desk who was helping me to check in that i would only stay two nights secondly no one told me that the upgrade was for three nights and non refundable
