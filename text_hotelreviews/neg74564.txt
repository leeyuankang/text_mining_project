we were in one of the new rooms accessed by the skyline lift unfortunately there were many items that should have been sorted out at the snagging stage of construction before they were handed over there was ceiling panel damage which drew your eye in the bathroom straight away during the night the toilet flush seemed to jam so water was constantly coming out when the flush button was depressed to try to free the valve the whole mechanism fell inwards making the toilet unusable until it was dug back out nothing was terrible really but for the high cost of the room we just expected a little more attention to detail and so should the hotel from its building contractors installation company
