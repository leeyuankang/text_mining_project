i paid good money the same as everyone else staying although it was made quite clear by looks from the staff and attitude that because i choose to wear tracksuits as this is how i m most comfortable i somehow didn t fit in and wasn t as welcome as other guests staying at the hotel really they shouldn t judge a book by it s cover as i am a business owner and stay in hotels of that standard and better often and am not treated like that anywere else
