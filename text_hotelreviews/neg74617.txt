we had a brand new room which was all electronically controlled from one panel the lights wouldn t turn off at night so we had to have our room reset after the reset the lights curtains aircon or telephone wouldn t work we went to sleep as it was late but then the next morning couldn t turn lights on to get ready and we couldn t even open the curtains to get some light in because they were controlled by the same panel the phone wouldn t work either haha a cleaner was on our corridor and we asked for her to contact reception to send someone up or to restart it again and no one came or nothing happened we understand this was totally teething problems as it was a new room but it did cut our relaxing stay a little short as we couldn t even make a brew reception after coaxing knocked a little from the room rate and have offered a reduced rate if we do stay again which we would the hotel is lovely and this hasn t put us off i will just maybe choose one of the more traditional rooms next time
