on arrival the hotel looked fantastic better than i expected but that s where it ended we arrived just after and we re told our room was not ready and to come back in an hour at around we returned and the room was ready we finally found our room which had a tiny number as the light up number outside our room was not connected wires on show the bed had two lovely towel swans on but was made a total mess with only one pillow each all the surfaces has cup rings and smears from previous guests the carpet was wet in various places where i m guessing the cleaner has stood a bucket the bathroom was filthy a dirty cloth used to clean the toilet the shower had mould along the edges it had clearly been repainted recently and there was paint all over the shower head the toiletries next to the sink had clearly been used and there was toothpaste from a previous guest down the frosted glass doors the sofa in the room which was originally yellow now with disgusting brown stains had some red cushions on with what looked like mud on the view was directly into flats next to the hotel even though our room was not cheap as it was new year s eve i knew the hotel was fully booked and we wouldn t be moved the following day we went shopping and returned to the room which had been cleaned a dirty cloth had been used to wipe the tv which now was smeared and stank the bed had been remade in a fashion pillows just thrown on also the cups spoons for tea making we re both dirty for a second time and we also noticed there was an issue with the plug socket next to the bed which worked when it fancied on the morning of our check out we were woken by workmen drilling outside the door hovering up dust disappointed is an understatement
