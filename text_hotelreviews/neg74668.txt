lighting in bedroom not good if one person wants to read in bed overhead bed lights not a good idea had to request extra pillows as only one on the bed eventually found information in desk drawer re personal choice of pillows having been exploring all day it was unacceptable to come back to our room to find the bedroom window had been left open by the housekeeping staff since morning maybe this would be welcome on a hot summer day but this is december i couldn t find any information in the room about hotel facilities and check out times we didn t make booking for breakfast but enquired at the restaurant on floor about just coffee and croissant but they said it was a set price for breakfast and there was not pricing available to meet our request
