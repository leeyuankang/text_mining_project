i had a room at the back of the hotel so no view and noisy trains but i guess that is the luck of the draw the room and furniture looked tired though i hear that a renovation is planned the background music in the restaurant at breakfast time is too loud and more suited to a nightclub or bar the area around the hotel is not particularly pleasant and offers little or nothing in the way of interest or entertainment except the imperial war museum
