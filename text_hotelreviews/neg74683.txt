i had booked twin rooms but when we arrive they upgraded us to a suite which we thought was nice but it wasn t the room had a sofa bed and a double bed but the mattress on the sofa bed was as thin as paper and i was basically lying on the metal bars which was incredibly uncomfortable we packed our cases and they moved everything for us while we were out for the day to a twin room the next day and everything was fine then and the beds were comfy and the bathroom spotless
