i was asked to pay on arrival and was charged an extra as a deposit on any extras incurred the receptionist told me this would be refunded on checkout but in fact it still has not been refunded over hours later despite no extras being incurred my room was near the lift shaft which meant that i was kept awake until as i could hear the lift going up and down the shaft all night also the heating in the room was controlled by the a c vent which blew out air sounding like a vacuum cleaner impossible to sleep with the racket so i had to switch off the heating and froze in bed
