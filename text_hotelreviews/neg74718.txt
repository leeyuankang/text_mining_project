location isn t great for central london around a minute walk from charing cross took an age to check in even though there was no queue couldn t watch the tv as the digital reception was so poor and the lights were flickering as though there wasn t a continuous electricity supply the automatic door sensors at the entrance didn t seem to work and whacked me in the shoulder as i walked through then they charged over double for the room and it took two weeks to get my money back after being passed round numerous people saying they couldn t find it being asked to send bank account statements through numerous times eventually it was blamed on a system error and no apology or offer of any form of compensation was provided yeah i wonder just how often this happens never again
