only a small fraction of the rooms face in clearly desirable direction to have a good view everybody will ask for such a room of course we were disappointed there are new buildings appearing in very close proximity to the hotel which is spoiling the advantage of the splendid location the main asset therefore is the executive lounge which would share the ambience among all the guests if all the guests had access this would be my advice to the hotel
