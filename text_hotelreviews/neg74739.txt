firstly the room i was given was at the back of the hotel which backs onto waterloo s train tracks so very noisy i did ask to move but the hotel was full i paid over for one night so i wasn t impressed and even though i wear hearing aids you were very aware of them running every mins they did stop running around midnight also the room had a bizarre lighting system which when set on mood flickered all the time very annoying you also couldn t figure how to switch the lights off in the lounge area it was a suite the bed was very poor for the money charged and the furniture cheap old tired and badly damaged in places huge rip in the front of the sofa of about long won t be staying again
