upon arriving at the hotel my immediate thought was wow this place looks nice then i got to the front desk what they saw was a person with a shaved head missing tooth jeans and a hoodie not a former ice hockey player who is now a director of a software company upon seeing this it was insisted that i pay for my room up front in full but was described as a deposit the term desposit according to the dictionary is to give as security or in part payment upon taking issue with this i asked for a manager to clarify why a deposit of the full balance was required when it is standard practice to pay on departure the manager couldnt answer the question without his long period of hesitation and put it down to my method of card payment now where i come from peterborough by way of birmingham both uk a visa card is a visa card so after proteacted dicsussion i reluctantly paid the full ballance and then went up to my room i then ordered room service which took them a while to get what i was asking for which was simiply a burger and wasnt allowed to charge this to my room and again had to pay up front again i have no issue with this typically but given the issue i had at the front desk a theme started to present itself when the burger came it wasnt the warmest of food even though it was freshly prepared room staff then pretty much forced their way into the room and then spilt one of the drinks all over my floor i am surprised they didnt try and charge me for the replacemet all other evenings for food were ok except one where the food was stone cold however a hot replacement was provided then the second day came and my room key had been deactivated upon going to the front desk i confronted the manager again who advised me that he personally had put a letter of apology in my room with a new key that would work for the duration of my stay great how do i get a key that has been put in a room that i cannot access
