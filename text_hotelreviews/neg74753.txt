when i tried use the iron in the room it tripped out all the electrics a concierge came up it was midnight and said oh no not again he was very pleasant and fixed the problem i needed a different iron so housekeeping brought me one with no steam function i requested a different one and asked them to leave it outside the room at i tried to iron my shirt again the iron i had been left was dirty and left a black stain on my shirt then the electrics went out again and the same concierge returned and had to stand there whilst i tried to complete the ironing constantly resetting the electrics i reported my dissatisfaction when i checked out only to be told oh sorry about that here s your receipt not what i was expecting from a hotel of this calibre
