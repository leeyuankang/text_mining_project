there was a small issue with concierge bringing our luggage up to the room as reception had forgotten to notify them but the professionalism of the staff when i phoned them from the room was superb it really was no hassle at all to us and only a very light complaint well not really a complaint we all make mistakes concierge phoned us then the manager phoned us shortly after to see if we were happy which we were as they treated us well
