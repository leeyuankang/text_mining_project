breakfast was poor and dis organised half the dining room was blocked off at for no apparent reason also the room was an executive room with two uncomfortable chairs it is a business hotel and should not be sold as a tourist hotel as it lacks the comfort associated with that i have stayed in a few hotels in london as a regular visitor and this hotel offers little in the way of comfort
