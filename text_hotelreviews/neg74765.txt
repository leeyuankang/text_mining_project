early in the morning we woke up by the noise right outside our room there were workers who held on to renovate the floor i think this is completely unacceptable and unprofessional of a star hotel at least they could have closed the floor for the time of renovation the location of the hotel is not so great because of the railway you can hear trains that goes by and last thing was that i could not open my mini bar so i called concierge next day and it turned out that my deposit was not registered which was kind of a surprise to hear because i had paid it right after check in
