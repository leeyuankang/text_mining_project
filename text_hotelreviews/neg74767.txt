room location requested a quiet room high location on check in the receptionist checked and said he would give me a quiet room away from noise when i got to my room it was on the floor dark no views apart from a wall and drilling started as soon as i entered my room luckily i was only in my room a short time otherwise a fairly pleasant stay didn t see much else of the hotel as breakfast wasn t included in my rate
