having stayed at your hotel for night on saturday october room i wanted to express my concerns i asked for these comments to be passed over during my stay but wanted to confirm in writing as the lady in reception could only say sorry having paid just under for night i was extremely disappointed in the quality and standard of the room provided on arrival i was required to pay to cover anything used from the mini bar but then to my amazement the mini bar door would not open i was also very disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom especially the shower screen in the bathroom this made it extremely difficult to take a shower so had to stand in the bath as we were in a rush to get out as we had prior engagements there was no time to report this to get it sorted to reception and to be honest i didn t feel it was something i needed to do or my responsibility in such a high standard hotel which should have been at a high standard anyway on my arrival there was also a fault with the toilet on numerous occasions the cistern would not fill up so there was a constant hissing sound and unable to flush i also received a number of phone calls to the room early on sunday morning which i did not request a broken night s sleep was not what i wanted i have stayed at your hotel on a number of occasions previously but have never encountered any of the above issues i am also very disappointed as this was a surprise treat for my daughter and felt this was not good value for money as is the most i have ever paid for a double room too
