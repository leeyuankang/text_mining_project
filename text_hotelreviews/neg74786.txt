was told on arrival that l had ben upgraded you might say what s wrong with that room of one on there own was far to large felt quite lost it was cold and although l switched heating up this failed to warm up the rooms room was also right next to rail line train passes window so extremely noisy at all times throughout evening and night air lock in pipes so when someone located elsewhere used water in night there was a screech that frightened me to death would have preferred option of upgrade rather than being told original room booked based on website details would have more than suitable but didn t get to experience this not an enjoyable experience
