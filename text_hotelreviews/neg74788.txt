just a little thing and it s never happened before at this hotel so am assuming it s a one off didn t feel as though it had been properly turned over from the previous guest whilst it was clean and the bed was made and it was re stocked it wasn t done brilliantly there was still a used towel hanging behind the door that hadn t been removed and the bathroom bin was missing it s plastic insert ie you couldn t use the bin as it was just the metal lid casing there was also some waste paper under the bed nothing major but didn t quit fit what i m used to at this excellent hotel
