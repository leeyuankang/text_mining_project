the front desk staff was absolutely unfriendly i have never experienced such a bad and rude service they really do not value their customers if a problem arises you are the only one sorry about that and can count on your self to resolve it i had to walk up and down times because my room key was not working they were for some weird reasons upset and looked at you as if you were really getting on their nerves for being their customers i would never go back there and experience such a poor guest service
