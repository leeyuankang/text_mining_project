confusion over double charging on my credit card which was not resolved until i queried it the third time the poor staff response to a late night fire alarm and the poor signposting for fire stairs miscommunication over the timings for breakfast the mould on the top of the shower screen i could see that the space is hard to clean as it is only mls from the roof but it was very obvious and something could be done to minimise it the noise of the ac and the water gurgling in the pipes near the bath all night in all it seems like the staff were trying hard but just didn t quite get the details right
