considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed the furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned you can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom all in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about would definetly choose another hotel in london next time
