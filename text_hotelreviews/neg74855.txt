our bed was not made or ready when we arrived which was fine but the manager was quite rude and defensive she tried blaming us explaining that twin rooms were in demand we had booked this room months in advance so didn t appreciate her rudeness or excuse it took three room attempts before we were settled it was midnight so we were tired and would have just liked an apology rather than an excuse
