i understand that room rates are high in this part of london and that one aldwych is a very high standard hotel with room service but i felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices however the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices
