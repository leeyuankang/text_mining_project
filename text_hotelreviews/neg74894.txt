guy on valet parking counter very rude asked for advice on parking or who to speak to about it and he just asked if i wanted valet parking i said no and he looked past me and started speaking to the next person behind me very rude to be fair the next person i spoke to was sound but only because he wanted me to move my car out the taxi space
