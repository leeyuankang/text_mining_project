our fridge broke and was not fixed our key was taken from our room by the house cleaning staff and we had to fight to get a new one to be honest the cleaning staff barely attended to our room each day when i tried to order room service i was rudely spoken to by the employee about how busy they were and what an inconvenience it was as if it was my fault overall we felt the customer service was not what would we would expect for this type of hotel
