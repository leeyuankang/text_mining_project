we were not made aware of the building work when booking and as this was a special anniversary post cancer treatment weekend we may have looked elsewhere if we had known the scaffolding and cranes etc made it difficult to find our hotel and at times it was noisy the view from our room was not very nice the remote lighting was tricky at times to manage in the dark
