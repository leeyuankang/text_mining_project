our first room had scaffolding all over the windows we complained and were upgraded to a suite which was big but still with awful views over a noisy train line the bathroom had limescale all over it and the furniture was all chipped and broken we had a balcony a tiny pointless outdoor area only big enough for one person standing that was covered in pigeon poo didn t really add much to the view everything was just generally a bit tatty worn and tired very disappointing for a birthday stay especially for over and with no breakfast even included
