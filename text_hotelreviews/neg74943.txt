hotel under significant building works so my riverside view which i selected the hotel for actually looked out over a scaffolding and construction site together with a crane operating on the top floor i had booked the hotel as we were returning late after a concert and had booked the day off work and the check out also appealed to me sadly the crane and drilling in the corridors that reverberated throughout the hotel meant that we were not able to sleep past there was no onsite or nearby parking it felt like the only parking option was the concierge at per night nearest parking we could find was over the river metres away a real shame as i had paid a significant sum for our anniversary and wanted to stay somewhere more upmarket than the normal hilton we booked but sadly disappointed
