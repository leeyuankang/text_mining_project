the staff were not trained well our food was dropped on the floor once when sent out for heating the second time it got dumped into the bin as the staff member did not know english there were two conditioners kept along with two shampoos some days instead of a shampoo conditioner a body lotion and a shower gel one day the sugar was not kept in the cupboard we need to ask for water each time to make coffee and it is not complementary on a daily basis if you would like to heat your own food you will have to pay pounds per service the mini bar within the room is also not complementary however the view was amazing from the executive suite
