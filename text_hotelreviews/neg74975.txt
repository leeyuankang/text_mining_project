i was not aware of the on going construction work at the hotel before we arrived these construction works made it hard to find the hotel i would of expected a discount in price for this also the smell of paint on level was off putting and got on my chest the maids woke us up at half in the morning and this was not appreciated we didn t get told where to go for breakfast and the first day we ended up in an upgraded breakfast at a price the view outside our window was of train tracks not brilliant
