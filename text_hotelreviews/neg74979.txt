no choice of pillows surround sound or soundproofing all were advertised we were in what could be used as an adjoining room and the noise from the room next door was ridiculous just from them chatting and kept us awake until gone am we mentioned this upon checkout and were told to mention it when checking in next time i was so tired when i got home it would have been more relaxing to spend the weekend with my hectic six year old rather than have this break ordered breakfast to the room and pancakes were burnt and the building itself is still a construction site which isn t mentioned anywhere when booking so sitting outside in the sunshine as pictured is not possible
