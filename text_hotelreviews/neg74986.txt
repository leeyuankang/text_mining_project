strange policy for payments if you guarantee your booking by credit card they demand this card to be displayed at check in even if you are going to pay by cash after i ve paid by cash a full price of booking at check in the receptionist charged me additional pounds cash deposit for minibar i didn t count on such kind of expenditure so it was very inconvenient for me to have deposited this unplanned amount
