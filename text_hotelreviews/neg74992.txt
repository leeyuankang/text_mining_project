i had been emailing the hotel prior to my arrival as it was my partners bday and wanted to upgrade our room the staff member i was emailing had said they would arrange baloons and flower petals to decorate the room at no extra cost of i would like i said yes that would be lovely however when we arrived into the room this wasnt done very disappointing as this was a special occasion there was however a bottle of champagne in the room which was nice of the hotel aside from this we really enjoyed our stay and the hotel was beautiful and i would reccomend it
