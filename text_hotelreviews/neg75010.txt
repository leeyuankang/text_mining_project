we were made fun of half our day was wasted when checking in previous to a telephone conversation we were invited to check in in one hour we arrived after hours and were told there is construction work in the hotel and surrounding it with noise problems we were told that rooms with view towards the inside of the hotel were only available in a star hotel we were told to wait until it was so we went for a walk and when we came back at the room was not ready at the room was still not ready but we were offered a voucher for a drink which excluded cocktails and alcohol basically soo cheap dont give it if you dont want to offer it we threw the vouchers away after checking in the room smelled like fresh paint as the hotel was under construction and gasses were coming in from ventilation dont go there there are other options and the pictures are a misrepresentation of the hotel at its current state
