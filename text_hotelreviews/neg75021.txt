there was heavy drilling when we arrived we had to move to another room following a long journey to get to the hotel the bed was very hard we only found the pillow option leaflet the day of our departure the shower tray did not contain the water flooded the entire bathroom the fridge space for guests was far too small we had to keep moving the minibar items out the carpet was filthy although we were told the room was not generally offered to guests we had to wait past the pm arrival time for our room to be ready building works next door meant noise and goings on all day a reduction in tariff would have been welcome as we were not told of this prior to our arrival and paid a supplement for a river view room
