when we arrived at our rooms were not ready we were told that the adjoining rooms we booked had just been finished they had painted them that day and expected us to sleep in them disgusting we were eventually given other rooms not adjoining as requested the furniture in the rooms was scratched and marked after spillage of a drop of water we cleaned it up and the tissue was really dusty and dirty bathroom was clean we asked if we could have a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience and after a long discussion with the manager we did get this although we had gone to hotel to celebrate a friend s birthday we were hoping to get adjoining rooms so that we could celebrate in our rooms but had to go out instead won t be going back also we looked out onto scaffolding at the side of the building
