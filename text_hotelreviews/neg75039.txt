wasn t told there would be noisy building work going on was offered an alternative room but one overlooking railway and one closer to the building work would not have booked had i know there would be building work as here for an anniversary room is also internal so very dark room was hot and the air conditioning was very loud and inadequate bed was very uncomfortable and only three thin pillows for two people bed runner was stained overall disappointing stay and would not recommend hotel looks lovely in the lobby but the carpet in the hall way and bedrooms faded and the the rooms look tired
