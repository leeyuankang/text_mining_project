not great sound proofing i could hear conversation from next room and someone snoring at night building work within and adjacent to the hotel is ongoing so can be noisy during the day however its a fantastic location with great staff comfortable beds and very clean so i d return there is a good cafe on black prince road for breakfast at a fraction of the hotel cost
