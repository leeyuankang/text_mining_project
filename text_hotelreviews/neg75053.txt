unfortunately the hotel adjacent to the park plaza was having major refurbishment build and we did ask that we didn t want our room to face onto the building site the reception tried moving us but we still ended up in a room where we were looking out onto the building site and we had to leave our curtains closed both mornings whilst we showered and dressed as men were literally working a few feet from our window
