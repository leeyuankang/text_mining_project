i was very disappointed with the behaviour of the receptionist upon checking in i found her to be very rude i don t particularly like small talk and prefer to just get my room key and go but i don t appreciate someone being unpleasant towards me for no reason i was also disappointed with the in room dining service as i had previously enjoyed the risotto balls mini bites which the hotel website still had listed on its in room menu when i booked but they were not on the menu when i arrived the food i did order was however delicious bang bang chicken margarita pizza i order late night dining one of the nights after returning from a night out in london and i paid in cash however it took quite a long time for the server to return with my change lastly i had requested a quiet room to stay in and was put on the floor which i would have thought would be very quiet however i was disturbed after both night s sleep due to either banging within the hotel or the construction work that was happening outside of our window on the monday of our stay the room service and the quiet stay could be a matter of bad luck the main disappointment was the behaviour of the receptionist when i arrived
