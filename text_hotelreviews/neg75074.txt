carpets were a bit worn in main walkways and there was a stain on our bedroom carpet which was not particularly bad but would not take much to remove re work was being carried out in one of the rooms along from ours and drilling woke us up early we were no pre warned that this work was taking place i don t believe the hotel was fully booked so we should have been put on another floor or in a room further away
