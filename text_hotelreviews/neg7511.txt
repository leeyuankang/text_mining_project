pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure the bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol the hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience the pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel
