where do i start i m not one to complain but our travel was something that i would not like to do again when we arrived the hotel was stunning and mind blowing i thought we hit the jackpot then we are sent to the room which was room which was a suite well when we got in there the first thing was the view well there where doing building work right opposite our room so you can imagine the view we had they had two powerful spot light shining straight in the room so you can not see any out the window because of the light blur it was a lot worse because the windows where very dirty so that spoil our view as we had to shut curtains as soon as it started to get dark the other thing is as soon as you walk into the room there is a massive stain on the carpet curtains where all stained the sofa was like sitting on pavement slabs very uncomfortable we ordered room service got half chicken which was the driest chicken i ve ever tasted i also ordered room service again on new year s eve which was a simple bowl of chips and garlic bread that never turned up said it would be minutes an hr went past and still no food so i called them again and the told me that the guy had already left i said has he left with my order he said no it will be another minutes i said this is a joke just cancel my order that you never even got i got no apologies of him at all i complained at the front desk and after minutes the offered me pn of the room which was still not worth it as we saved for a long time to see the fireworks display we paid around for night which is the worst money i ve ever spent and that was with no breakfasts not happy spoilt our break
