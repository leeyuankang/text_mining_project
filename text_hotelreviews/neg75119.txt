we asked for a room with a nice view as this was a christmas gift when we got there the room we were given was opposite a building site so the view was awful the builders were drilling early hours of monday so we was rudely awakened which didn t bother us as much as we was up early but we had not been given warning that they were building work going as it was a sunday night an not particularly busy i would of thought we could of had a much better room than we was given for the price especially
