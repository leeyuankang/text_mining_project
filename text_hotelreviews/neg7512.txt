we arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and i specifically wanted and booked twin beds the lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative car to airport did not arrive agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least minutes prior to getting into a cab i personally checked on the car about minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which i found unusual for great britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there i felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask minutes later hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility
