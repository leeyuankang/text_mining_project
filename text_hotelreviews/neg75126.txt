we upgraded from our original room but the upgrade was somewhat outdated and jaded disappointing considering it was supposed to be a more superior room i believe it would benefit from refurbishment the main problem however is the work being done on the hotel and the machinery fixed onto the exterior of the building to transport building materials we were woken on the monday morning by the loud noise and vibrations caused by this machine we were not warned that this could be a problem nor were we warned that our room backed onto the railway lines and the trains could be heard in the room too disappointing overall
