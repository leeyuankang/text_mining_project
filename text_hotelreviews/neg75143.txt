air conditioning wasn t working and the room was far too hot which spoils it really also at reception when we booked in we were told that the locality card we were given would give us off the restaurant and bar so in the evening on our return we went to the bar for a cocktail only to be told we couldn t use the card for drinks only food not very well explained from reception the lovely lady in the bar did take the off in the end as she said she wanted us to be happy and that we would feel happy there she was wonderful and handled the situation perfectly
