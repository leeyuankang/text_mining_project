although i requested a river view if possible as shown in the pictures on the website we unfortunately were overlooking another building and there was a roof of scaffolding between our building and the other one so the room was dark and it wasn t possible to see what the weather was doing there was no mention of this work prior to the trip there was also lime scale marks on the shower cubicle the biscuits were not replenished and there was no bin liners in the bins in the room or the bathroom
