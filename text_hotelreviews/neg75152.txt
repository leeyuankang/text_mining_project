hotel had a problem with the heating for this particular room which we weren t advised about until we asked this was early hours of the morning we were invited to change rooms however this was inconvenient giving the time of the night also building was shrouded with scaffolding which we we re unaware of until arrival this altered the view but didn t impact on our stay too negatively
