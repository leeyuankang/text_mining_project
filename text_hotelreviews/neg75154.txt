i was really impressed with the hotel rooms and service the only thing that was very disappointing was there was clearly rust in our bathroom mirror which i would have thought that would have been replaced although it was a lovely hotel i really thought this let it down there was also a crack in the mirror of my friends room mirror to again a little upsetting
