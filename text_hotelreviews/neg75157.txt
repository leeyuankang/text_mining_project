we booked an executive twin room which was on the floor the view was of the building works next door there was no view of the river we were expecting and the windows did not keep out the noise so we asked to upgrade to the next room available so we were moved to the floor the view was amazing much better then before however at we were woken up by builders working on the top of our hotel our phone also rang at and with no one on the other end we did not ask for a wake up call
