we wasn t aware that there was building work going on all around the hotel it could sometimes be quite noisy the carpets in the hotel make it look quite dirty as they are full of stains we were on the floor i have stayed in much better fancier rooms with hints of personal touches for a lot less money the staff in the restaurant at breakfast need to learn to smile more and be more friendly
