we have stayed at this hotel before and had a lovely time but this time we were disappointed i had been made aware that there was some building work on the roof but when we got there it was a huge extension being built also there were building works going on on both sides of the hotel i asked for a river view we got a building site with a small glimpse of the river when we arrived the breakfast was not included and so our stay became very expensive with an extra on top of the price we had to have breakfast there as there is no other places near to have breakfast this is where the river is a lovely location if you can see it but everthing is a minute walk we had a lot of problems with our keys and so had to keep getting new ones i spoke to the hotel about the fact that i was not happy with the room and was just offered an inside room i had booked the hotel because i like the river in the mornings all you could hear were workmen and they could easily see into your room i spoke to another visitor and she said they went past her room in on a platform the breakfast was reasonable but i felt i was in a school canteen
