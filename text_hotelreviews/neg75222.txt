i was given a room on the top floor and was not made aware by the reception staff that very noisy works were going on above me to extend the hotel upwards there was noise when i got into the room at and an unbelievable racket commenced at in the morning so much so that you could not stay in the room the rooms on the top floor are not fit for occupation under these conditions and should be not made available or sold at very discounted rates there is also no natural light into the room due to a canopy over the central atrium so it feels like constant night time when you are in the room
