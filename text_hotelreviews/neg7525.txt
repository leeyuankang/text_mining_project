small grumble we had the afternoon tea however there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the baftas so we had to eat in the general dining area i think we should have been told that when we booked then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners no one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there
