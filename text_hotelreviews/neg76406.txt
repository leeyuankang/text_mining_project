check in the lobby is a bit confusing as there is a check in table in the middle of the lobby and a traditional check out area set up in the back there is not a clear indication of where to form a queue the wait was approximately although pullman is a chain they don t have the same standards as a marriott or a hilton the check in clerk kept repeating loudly our room number not comforting to two women checking in the room service the only problem with the room is the mini fridge is completely stocked with beverages for purchase so essentially useless common but annoying we called for a wine opener never came we called for toilet paper more towels since we didn t get turnover it didn t come until we called again an hour later on top of this the gentleman delivering these items had a major attitude i had to stop myself from laughing at him half way through our night stay our keycard stopped working apparently they were having computer issues sometimes we would return late and there would be no one in the lobby except the front desk staff they would look at us but never greet us same level of service for our check out no taxis were lined up so the hotel staff shrugged and walked off thank goodness paris had uber which we used fairly frequently special requests this hotel does not accommodate special requests or is not equipped to i sent an email to the hotel concierge staff in regards to procuring a reservation at a restaurant no response we also called ahead a few days prior to let them know we will be expecting a package our wifi jetpack a day prior to our arrival to ensure it was not rejected it was rejected although when our luggage never came aegean airlines they did deliver it to our room at which worked for us because we desperately needed it
