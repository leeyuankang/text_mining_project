i was entirely underwhelmed by my experience staying at this property though the location is fantastic many negative factors came into play my wife and i arrived early in paris and left our bags with the valet when we returned to pick up our room keys at pm we had to wait for minutes as only two people were there not only checking in guests but acting as concierge at the same time when we finally did get our room keys they said they would have someone bring up the bags after sitting in the room for an hour and exhausted after traveling for hours we went downstairs where the guy who was suppose to deliver our bags said they never gave him the ticket we carried our own bags up to the room where once we pulled the sheets back on the bed saw that the mattress cover was entirely too small for the bed leaving a inch gap on all sides and effectively making the bed one size smaller every single time i tried to order room service no one ever answered the phone eventually a recorded message only in french came on then hung up on us after the third time no one answered the room service line i rang the front desk and they said they would have room service call us back which they finally did minutes later as we were about to leave to head out to find food elsewhere only about half of the nozzles in the rain shower head worked when we went to use the workout room we found worms in the two nectarines we tried to eat i know this one isn t the hotels fault per se but was indicative of our experience the room next to us had what i assume was a wakeup call every morning though no one ever answered their phone and it rang continuously other than the location i would not recommend this property
