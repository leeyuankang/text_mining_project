the hotel smells badly the rooms smell of manure the managers kept asking us if we would like them to spray the room it was impossible to sleep there comfortably at night it is just bad nice clean bathrooms but i called twice to get more coffee in the room and no one assisted the actual room is poorly decodated and i m pretty sure the smells comes from the cheap pu furniture wouldn t recommend although the rooms manager tried to apologise and gave us some chocolate i hardly ever review a hotel negatively as i stay in pretty good places and it s hardly ever necessary to write a bad review but this was quite disappointing
