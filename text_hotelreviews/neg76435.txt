our eiffel tower view king room with the balcony required you to have to lean over the balcony to even see it do not order the steak we ordered it and it looked great but after one bite we were so disgusted i almost got sick in fact my daughter did get sick it didn t even taste like beef i m not sure what it was but it was very bizarre and we both still have trouble eating steak because of this experience the staff was very nice and made sure they apologized and refunded me for the bad steak honestly the food wasn t very good the only things we could eat were the french fries and bread so we ordered room service every night champagne wine french fries and bread also be careful not to have any accidents while there don t spill your wine or ketchup on the carpet because there are no towels to clean it up with and they will charge you a fee we were charged euro cleaning fee because my son spilled ketchup on the carpet and i wasn t able to get it out i personally never thought the room was super clean even when we checked in maybe i am wrong but i thought euro was a little steep for that i would have understood paying euro but maybe they don t have access to the same cleaning supplies i am accustomed to
