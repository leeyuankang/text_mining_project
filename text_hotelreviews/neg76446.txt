breakfast was the same everyday standard nothing special or local menu it was bland i booked s suite for my family and paid a lot of money per night it just wasn t worth it unfortunately the only good thing about this location is it s location the views are amzaimg if you get in the eiffel tower side local to tourists and good cafe restaurants walking distance it s good for a short visit days
