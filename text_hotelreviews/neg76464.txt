so we got the deluxe king room and it was such a huge disappointment the eiffel view basically means you ll hardly see the eiffel on the right handside behind a huge tree and pillars such a waste of money when we addressed this the guy at the front reception said it s called clever marketing more like customer deception anyway the manager was a very lvoely helpful woman and she said she d give us a smaller room but with a better view but we couldnt be refunded the amount we paid for the dekuxe king room later on our friend wasnt well at night and the staff was extremely unhelpful they wouldnt call the hospital or the ambulance and while our friend clenched her chest and was throwing up they were just on the phone insisting we get a private doctor and just wouldnt call the ambulance it was an extremely traumatizing experience and their customer service needs to be worked on tremendously we had paid for two nights but checked out the very same night and didnt even get a refund
