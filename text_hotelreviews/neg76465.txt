we ordered a room with view of eiffel tower at euros but the room is small and we had completely no view of the tower inside the room the tower can only be seen at the balcony and we only managed to see the tower mins every half hour because it s too cold in winter to stay at the balcony the upstairs are having party and it was very noisy it is the worst part of our paris trip
