to start off they messed up my reservation i went there with my daughter for new years wanted a room with a view of the tower and what i got after getting it squared away was first floor with a view of bee hives and a winter garden after talking with another woman they had messed her stay as well emailing later that they had her room that she wanted available for a fee i had gotten the same email after talking to her i knew for sure it was a scam and restaurant is a joke got med hamburgers that were barely touched the heat of the skillet and sadly enough for french cuisine the best thing we had at that restaurant was mac cheese and the staff was to blame i m sure for that
