after initial check in staff on front desk were not helpful or cared there was a conference and the hotel sponsored a major sporting event so our floor was noisy and not secure as promised when we asked for another room they were too full and offered a downgraded room on a lower floor with no view and no compensation for our situation as we were not part of the conference or sport event very disappointed went to use the iron and wisely rethought the process wires were loose and dangerous not what i expected from a pullman hotel
