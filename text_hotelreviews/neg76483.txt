actually everything was perfect with pullman hotel but after we checked out on dec around they sent us email at told us that the housekeeper couldn t find the hairdryer in our room and they wanted to charge us we didn t take the hairdryer and we explained to them where we put the hairdryer back to it s place they replied that they will check again to the housekeeping and until now still no news from them i hope they already find the hairdryer and i still wait for my credit card bill to make sure there is no charge from pullman hotel
