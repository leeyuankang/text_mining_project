not all staff were friendly in reception not bother to help one of the receptionist was impatient i was asking for car service and he thought i was asking for card so he interrupted me and asked me for the room number and gave the room key card without even asking me questions with the security issues in paris they should be more careful and cautious when guests ask for extra key at least as for the name booked under the room
