the wines provided are terrible and expensive for half bottle we were very disappointed specially because france is famous for good wine we opened bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible we were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it
