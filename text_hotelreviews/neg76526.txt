overall we think this is an overpriced hotel with ok facilities after traveling through europe we thinks this hotel is overpriced for the quality of service they offer breakfast wasn t good they have a lot of selections but taste is just not good we ordered room service at midnight after a long flight and they didn t have anything hoy but only cold soup and fish they re no chef at night so you get only cold premade dishes lobby is ugly and confusing and the staff it s not very helpful our room overlooking the eiffel tower was expensive and we were left without electricity for more than an hour we keep asking for someone to come up a help us and they kept saying it was in his way but took a long time to get this solved
