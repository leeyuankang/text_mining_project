we booked well in advance and paid for a lot for a nice room however on arrival we were very disappointed to only be on the first floor and have no view of the city after discussing with staff they moved us up beware we had a balcony with tower view but that means we couldn t see the tower from the room only when we stepped onto the balcony also there were no chairs etc in the room so couldn t actually sit on the balcony only stand
