i don t usually complain but we just wanted a romantic night my birthday with room service and movies we had some drinks in the lobby and was made to feel like we were about to do a runner on the bill as the bar tender demanded we pay for our drinks so that was the first awkward and embarrassing incident second the movies would not work we had constant calls and technicians visit with still no success the movies never worked room service food was ordinary have had better on a plane of which they forgot part of it so again we had more visitors basically the night was a disaster and we did not get any peace until around the manager tried to appease us with wine and chocolates which was nice but for the amount we paid for the room and have it ruined didn t really compensate
