everything the service is horrible room service is more than horrible they even don t have a breakfast menu when i called to order and i ordered times not once they say call after minutes and when i call to bring something like ice or ketchup they usually answer me like ok on the way and no one show up they don t clean the room they don t change the bedsheets they only fix the bed my stay was the worst ever i don t recommend at all btw it was written like garden view it wasn t a garden and when i asked to change my room view to the other side they asked me to pay euro
