i have been robbed and the staff were not helpful specially the receptionist after calling them over and over for an hour and then i told them there is no valuables in the the bag that they did not load to my car and when i got the bag external chargers were gone all usb wires samsung laptop but i am grateful that after talking to them over the phone over and over for an hour till i said that there are no valuables in the bag just medication of my child and some medical documents that are very important the bag suddenly appeared after they have told me that it has been already kept in the taxi and it s not in the hotel and i had it delivered to me to the airport by my driver they didn t even offer any help as it was there mistake not loading my bag however i am thankful i got the bag back but it s outrageous that a star hotel would go through my bag and take whatever they desire and lie about the bag till i said that there r no valuables it s pathetic
