wifi was awful employees were rude their english was incompetent room service was disaster i asked for a birthday candle and they couldn t manage to find it for two days they wanted euros to bring an ice bucket and they couldn t bring a bottle opener for three days and when i complained to the reception i was told to bring my bottle to the restaurant reception is not capable of helping on anything they will tell you that your problem is not their problem finally if you are going to catch a plane after your check out check out at least four hours before your plane s departure because they will try to charge you for stuff you even didn t touch from the mini bar and it will take like an hour to fix the issue we almost catch our plane
