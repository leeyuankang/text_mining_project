the hotel is expensive for what it is i didn t like being harassed at to leave the room when the check out time is the view wasn t great from my room and although they upgraded us to a suite because our original room wasn t available we didn t have a nice view some shabby flats opposite and there was no balcony and i had to share a double bed with my friend instead of the twin beds i had booked the breakfast is very limited in options i ve had far better so i would recommend eating breakfast outside of the hotel i enjoyed my stay but i think you can find better value for money
