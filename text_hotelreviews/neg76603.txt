no mirror in the room except the bathroom long mirrors were available outside in the hallway balcony is nice as u can see the eiffel tower however no chairs and table provided in the balcony we were charged for early checked in ie we requested or hour late check out ie the reception informed that will be charged this is an unusual policy of a star hotel there is nothing romantic sense about the hotel it is more for business trip maybe the decor smelly carpet in the hallway to the room some fresh lilies or air freshener could help removing the stinky smell position of the bed is facing the door to balcony and the sunset is direct to your face when you try to unwind after a day of walking tried pulling the curtain not as easy as we thought the standing lights is not convenient it fell down whenever we try to slide the curtain
