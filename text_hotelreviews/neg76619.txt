the hotel staff stole my travel wallet cash credit cards included i had checked in my baggage into the security storage area upon check out to be collected later in the afternoon when my flight was upon my return i noticed that the zipper to my bag pack was open and my travel wallet stolen the hotel staff were not helpful at all in resolving the issue and instead asked me to go file a police report the security room did not have a camera and thus the perpetrator knew exactly what he she was doing the facility manager follow up on the phone with me several days later out of sheer courtesy but never offered to reimburse anything or offer me a free stay after they were notified that my insurance company was not going to reimburse me because the items were supposedly in a secure room what a nightmare from a hotel that you would otherwise think is well rated
