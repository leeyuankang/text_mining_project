the staff in the frame resturant where very unprofessional as made me and my partner feel very uncomfortable when we ordered our food they then took our order away and we could hear them speaking about us and kept looking over at where we were seated this was making us feel very uncomfortable and awkward however the food was lovely and we enjoyed it but just felt uncomfortable with the staff mainly the three ladies waitressing
