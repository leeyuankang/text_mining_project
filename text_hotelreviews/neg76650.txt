i loved frames restaurant in the hotel the staff there were very friendly on the contrary the reception staff were not as friendly the location is good u have a very good distance from eiffel tower but with a slight corner not a full view and the hotel has a sports ground for football which can be a bit noisy in mornings if ir looking to relax all in all its a good hotel nice interior rooms are in good size compared to hotels in europe
