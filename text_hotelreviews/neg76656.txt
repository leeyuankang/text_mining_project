i didn t like that i paid for a superior room with an eiffel tower view and the view i got was very unacceptable i could only see the equivalent of a metre view so we had to then pay to get a view of the eiffel tower which after the initial shock of having to pay even more money the view totally made our stay and we had a brilliant stay
