unfortunately we had some money stolen from our room approx and when reported to the staff they informed us that an investigation would be done and get back to us after hrs no response regarding the investigation and as our insurance would cover us for only lost in cash we have not made a claim i explained to them that obviously they have staff working for them who are thieves and their response was well you should have locked your money in the safe provided very poor attitude and i will be writing to their manager requesting a full report on their investigation but safe to say we will never stay there again when we visit paris regards mike and marita o connor
