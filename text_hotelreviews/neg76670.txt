i felt the staff were average the initial check in was particularly awkward having paid for an upgrade to an eiffel tower view specifically a room on the higher floors we were given floor which was a bit of a joke floor higher then the standard room all we could see was the corner of the eiffel tower no furniture on the balcony so we could not sit down out there or enjoy the limited view
