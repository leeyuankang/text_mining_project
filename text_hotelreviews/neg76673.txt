being fooled i paid for a room with view to the eiffel tower well my view was to the foot ball field they have in front of the hotel if i wanted to see the eiffel tower i would have to go to the balcony and look to my left from the balcony that is not a view to the tower as they show in their photos that is a trick a lie and dishonest i could have paid half the money and not believe a lie to trick you and have you pay more for nothing
