the room we got had a stinky smell when we came in and i reported it quickly to the front desk when we came back the staff apparently just sprayed some air freshener so the smell improved a bit however the bad smell came back and it s coming from the bathroom and even if i reported it again to the front desk nothing was done also the carpet in the room needs to be changed already
