when we got to our room the balcony door was wide open and the room was freezing on further inspection the handle was broke so we called to get it sorted sat in our room for a guy came up to fix the door he got it to open and shut again but there was still a draft after calling again i waited a further mins by this point i was annoyed cold and hungry so i went down stairs and told the lady at reception she basically told me someone would come to fix it and that was that later we got a phonecall saying it wouldn t be sorted until the following morning it didn t get sorted so we ended up just putting the heating on for the duration of our stay for this reason on my next trip i would choose another hotel
