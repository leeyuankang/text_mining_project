paris has a city tax both booking com the hotel made no mention of this additional charge thus when i checked out thinking i d have a balance because i prepaid through booking com i was told i owed an additional euros for a city tax the problem is i exchanged all my euros back to u s dollars the night prior to my check out i only kept enough euros to pay for a taxi so i had to use my credit card in order to pay for the city tax plus the international fee my credit card charged me all of this could ve been avoided had i known to keep some extra euros for this city tax fee the hotel staff said the city tax fee could not be added in my prepaid booking because they aren t allowed to add the city tax until the check out day i have no complaints about the tax i just simply wished i would have known how many euros to keep on me for the city tax to prevent me from using my credit card incurring the additional international fee
