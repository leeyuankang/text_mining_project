not very organized reception area people cannot understand where is a queue for check in check out registration tables are in a middle of the hall near the elevators and all people are walking around spent hour for check in there is no actual view from the room to the eiffel tower you can see it only if you go to the balcony but you cannot see it from any point if you are inside the room no point to pay for it all rooms walls are very thin you can hear your neighbors and cars on the road in overall cost of the room is to high for such hotel hotel next door was much cheaper for same quality with no view to the tower
