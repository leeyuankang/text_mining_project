only one slightly bad experience we got stuck in one of the lifts on our return to our room at night i was a little disappointed with the staff once we managed to get out of the lift as they were more interested in the lift than us to be honest i think they were very embarrassed at the situation and this took preference they did apologise and brought us some water but after that they just left us
