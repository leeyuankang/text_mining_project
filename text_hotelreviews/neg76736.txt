booked a double bed room for nights with balcony and eiffel tower view on arrival i was told that this room is too small for adult and small children i got a bigger room for an additional charge of euros per night this room was featuring one double bed no balcony and facing the backyard although dissapointed with one sleeping and two crying kids i decided to stay the first night and cancel the second the receiptionist agreed and showed me the cancelation on her computer she said she would transfer the money back on the next day however during checkout i was informed that they never do refunds and will keep the money certainly my last stay at this chain
