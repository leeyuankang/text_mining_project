the bar staff let the hotel down badly more interested in chatting than serving guests very slow service even when quiet staff were sat around the bar drinking in the late evening playing louder music not a good image the staff partying they were desperate and encouraging quests to leave so they could clear up the truth was it was because they wanted to drink party in bar area this needs sorting it s not a good image for a four or five star hotel you would not see that happening in a pullman in london
