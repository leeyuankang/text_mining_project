the check in out was very confusing i understand trying something new but there needs to be a more smoother way of checking in and out the receptionists also didn t feel comfortable with this arrangement they need their space they need to be behind a desk so their energy isn t drained from travelers being in their space let the receptionist have a desk in front of them with a desk between the travelers so they have that space if you are doing this so travelers can see the screen that can also be done with the receptionist still behind the desk also the elevators don t feel safe i felt like something wasn t program right and you feel shaking not a solid feeling
