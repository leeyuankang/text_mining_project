room and dining area differed from the advertising on booking com the hotel is further away from the eiffel tower as pictured in the video we paid euros and had a view of a soccer field had to go on the balcony for a view of the tower which was still very far away than advertised from the room with a view the hotel would not refund our money after being disappointed about our room blaming booking com for the advertising of their hotel not impressed with paying so much for a room that was small and no direct view of the eiffel tower
