restaurant near lobby had mediocre service we went there on saturday night around and it wasn t busy we were seated then forgotten about for min despite me waving at a hostess and her acknowledging me we left as we had plans for the evening and this was a waste of time and ordered room service and had our food in minutes but at a higher cost obviously
