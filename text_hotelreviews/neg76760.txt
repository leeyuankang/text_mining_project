location proximity to shops is woeful staff english particulary in housekeeping bad had to pay a check out tax of euros which was not explained or advertised at all view of tower although advertised as great was bad couldn t see it from room veranda other than a very small sideways portion i did read this comment from other reviewers but thought they were being a bit harsh but now i know better stay in the city and transport to the tower could also hear the guests in the room above walking around and next door don t waste your money at this place like i did
