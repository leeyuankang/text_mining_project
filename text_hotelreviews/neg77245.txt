i have to say i was annoyed about the breakfast buffet breakfasts are easy because basically the staff just offer tea and coffee and clear and lay tables yes like all london hotels they can get very busy but i was not offered any tea or coffee when i arrived the room was half empty but virtually no spare clean tables as they were are all had dirty cutlery and crockery not cleared away i never felt they were on top of it at all sad because the food was good
