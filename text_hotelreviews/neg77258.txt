our room needed refurbishment badly bathroom was the worst part it was not a proper bathroom for a room in star hotel our neighbour next door was smoking and the ventilation was so poor that we woke up at am because our bathroom was full of cigarette smoke and the hotel could not do anything for almost a whole day afterwards we even considered to change the room personnel was very polite and smiled a lot but was not very effective in changing the situation overall if you can find another hotel not far from the area please do it
