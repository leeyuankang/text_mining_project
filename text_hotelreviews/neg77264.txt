the beds are on rollers which means every time you move the bed moves the beds are also incredibly soft and bouncy which doesn t help if they re on rollers we booked a twin room but were only given one flannel and one set of toiletries we asked times over the space of hours if we could have an additional flannel and toiletries eventually they were left in our room in the room description it says the room is equipped with an iron and ironing board but in fact you had to request them again it took requests over the space of hours the iron and ironing board were delivered but as we weren t in our room they left them outside in the corridor which meant that i had to then lug a huge ironing board into the room it was so big it took up the entire space in the room there is a sign in the room saying that it has been newly renovated but there is a rip in the leather chair which has been badly mended and the room just looks old and tired as with a lot of these hotels there were no sockets by the bed which is ridiculous in this day and age considering this is supposed to be a star hotel the food is poor we ordered a quinoa salad and a salmon open sandwich and the salad had more walnuts in it than quinoa the sandwich came with crisps which is normal but they were really potent cheese and onion flavoured not the best with salmon we asked if we could have cocktails but were told that cocktails were off that night because they were re printing the list we asked if we could have a mocha and they didn t know how to make it on the morning i decided to treat myself to breakfast in bed and ordered a continental breakfast so was surprised to discover a full english instead the coffee was cold as was the toast all in all we were not impressed with the hotel considering how much we paid and considering that it is in such a smart location i would not recommend this hotel to anyone
