location didn t work for me i was there with my year old and nearest tube was st johns wood which took us about mins to walk alone would have been about mins and had a bad experience walking back one night after dark which made me feel unsafe walking after dark however if you want to be near regents park and abbey road don t mind the walk to tube or plan on taking the bus i m sure it will be fine photos of exterior didn t look like ones on website
