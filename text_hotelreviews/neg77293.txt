in the booking process i wasn t made a aware that there was going to be an extra charge for the breakfast this made the cost of the hotel for the night quite high i ve paid less for a much nicer hotel the photo s were enhanced the external surrounds and stair access to the gym were not great and not so clean the hotel had construction works going on in the lobby area so this also detracted from the experience the food was a very high in price tea and scone for two
