the rate we paid was much higher than for my husband s stay earlier this spring the pedestrian approach to the entrance leaves much to be desired it would be good to have free wifi in the room the heavy steel plug for the bathtub was disguised as an ornament at the back of the soap dish instead of being identified or placed in the plughole and the facecloth disappeared after its first use never to be replaced we had neatly hung it with our towels for re use but apparently the maid prefers to remove anything used once despite the notice on the bed about conserving resources two face cloths and two small towels would have been nice since we were two people but even the stack brought to us on request lacked those the fire stairs were not an attractive alternative to the lift for future reference a question can guests at the hotel for a reasonable charge use the airport transport that serves the airline personnel saying at the danubius
