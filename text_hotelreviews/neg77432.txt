no real bad experiences worth mentioning other than there is such a small bar for such a large hotel so you can have a wait if wanting a drinking late evening also we took an executive room but didn t get the bottle water bathrobes and slippers which are what make exec over superior didn t complain but mentioned at checkout so got parking for free instead happy days
