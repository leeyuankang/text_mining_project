i booked executive suite but given standard room without even telling us first day they offered complementary breakfast for all days bottle of alcohol and fruits although breakfast was not included in my booking second day we realized they were trying to cover it i spoke to duty manager hussain as i remember and he advised us to cancel the booking i made through booking com and make another booking from hotel which is impossible in the second day and when i argued why i have been given standard room their excuse was at first no rooms available and later on they said because you wrote a note asking for a room near by elevator ok i have paid for an executive so i expect executive whether near by elevator or not after arguing we ve been given an executive room which means room were available
