i really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating my room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room i saw no drinking water in the room or fridge staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day before my check out like i was a thief or something similar and i felt very uncomfortable about this i travel for work every week and i have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time i felt this way the location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper
