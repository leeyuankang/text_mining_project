we had requested a quiet room the room we had was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors it meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants luckily they were not too noisy people it should not have been allocated to us if they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space
