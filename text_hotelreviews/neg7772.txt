we were told we got upgraded on arrival to the eiffel tower view room wow great in we go into the smallest elevator ever max to the top floor the room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the eiffel tower for what that was worth what they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing i mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor crazy we informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the eiffel tower from the balcony so much for upgrades
