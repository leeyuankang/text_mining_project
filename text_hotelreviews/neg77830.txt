we had come to the hotel previously and had an incredible stay this time however we were incredibly disappointed with the unprofessionalism of the front desk staff we were told our room would be ready by the check in time but were left waiting over an hour and a half past the check in time the staff was hardly apologetic and didn t even seem to care about their blatant breakdown in communication this hotel was always our go to place when we visited paris but from now on we will take our business elsewhere
