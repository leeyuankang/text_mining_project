our room faced the street with a small juliette balcony picturesque but the street noise and restaurant noise kept us up most of the night get an inside room if you value sleep there is no lobby to wait in only a bar that is closed until evening a restaurant that closes in between meals and a hall with a tiny alcove i thought breakfast was included with the booking but they said no not a problem as there are beautiful pastries at the end of the street
