room claustrophically small very dark decor even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out if you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it skimpy small hard towels in bathroom hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions on line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large it s a very small lobby and maximum suitcases and people in elevator hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway this was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls a few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room we d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard we made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use was ok for purpose used but not one i would recommend to others
