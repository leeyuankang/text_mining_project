this could go on for some time this place it appears to be an old converted block of flats from around the s it has a seriously very narrow central spiral staircase with a lift that was installed at a very much later date and as so does not come to ground floor but appears halfway up a flight of stairs this is the same for all floors elderly people or those with walking problems will find this either considerably difficult to deal with or even dangerous i am not joking to reach this lift i a year old man had to carry my heavy luggage up to this lift on my own as no help was offered or given upon studying this further and reading the emergency escape instructions if the central stairway becomes blocked you are then instructed to remain in your rooms please note this instruction because there are no external fire escapes i suppose it s easier to remove bodies this way rather than cleaning up the outside pavements of those who attempted to jump to safety the rooms themselves are just about big enough to take a full size double bed which then leaves about inches either way for you to get round the shower works quite well though and breakfast is just about passable for a cheap hotel of which this one is not i do not consider this place value for money nor do i recommend it to anyone else i am also writing to booking com to make a formal complaint with regard to their promoting this hotel as it is quite obvious no one appears to have checked this place before advertising it
