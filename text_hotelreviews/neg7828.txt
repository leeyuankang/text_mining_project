i had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of paris unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room it was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and i had to stand on a chair to use the safe it was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time the windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in i didn t change my room because i didn t spend much time in it
