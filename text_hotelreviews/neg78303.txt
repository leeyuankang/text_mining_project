the service from the staff wasn t very accommodating as we arrived as the terrorist attack began they were not comforting quite sharp not compassionate and acted as normal rather than ensuring you were okay during the crisis also staff at breakfast stared out of the window until we were finished looking not comforting either subtitles didn t work on the tv and staff were unaware how to change this this was distressing as we were trying to find out what was going on in paris during the terrorist attack and couldn t understand again staff did not try to accommodate use of the word bar within the hotel is a huge over statement there are a few bottles at the side of reception to choose from definitely wouldn t call it a bar
