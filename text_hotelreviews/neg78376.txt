the bed is super small if you travel with a friend it is not suitable bathroom is not convenient there was nowhere to put shampoo shower gel which was very annoying staff said they were currently renovating and thus they removed all the shampoo etc holders in the showers late at night we had no warm water to shower but could be that we did not wait long enough as also one afternoon it took a few minutes to get really hot water room was clean overall but there was hair in the shower
