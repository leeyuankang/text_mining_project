the staff were friendly but seemed to have fairly limited english and the airport shuttle advertised on booking com is not a shuttle at all but instead a limo service that the desk will book for you so be warned i specifically booked this hotel for the airport shuttle and was shocked when a mercedes sedan arrived to pick us up and then i had to back british pounds for the minute ride to the airport to top it all off he only accepted cash because that is how it was booked resulting in my boyfriend having to run into the terminal to find a cash machine so we could pay had i known that it was not a shuttle i would not have booked this hotel or booked the shuttle through the hotel and instead taken an uber or the underground for a fraction of the cost perhaps it was a language barrier but when i asked for the shuttle at the front desk there was no clarification that they were booking a limo what the cost would be or that i would have to pay cash i felt completely blindsided and cheated once we were picked up and dropped off at the airport
