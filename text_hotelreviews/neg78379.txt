they do not proactively honour the genius perk you have to ask for it or decide not to be calculative and give it up i don t think is the right way to treat guests this is not exactly a fair review because not everyone will encounter the situation i find that the staff are not trained to handle special circumstances well the air conditioning in my room was not working and the hotel was well aware as there was already an electric fan in the room i understand that such things happen what i find unacceptable is that the staff did not inform me when i check in i had a rude shock when i get to my room i think it is disrespectful to not acknowledge seek understanding communicate to guest that they are not able to offer what was clearly stated in the facilities they offer which the guest paid for as a whole package if the hotel is clearly aware of the situation even if the staff just took over the shift everyone should be briefed on what is going on in the hotel right now and have a proper handover for a star hotel so i find it hard to be understanding i was not offered any goodwill compensation until i went down to complain electric fan is not a like for like replacement of air conditioning it takes up room space and it is actually not very effective because the window cannot open more than inches but my main issue is actually how can they be so disrespectful i went to talk to the staff when the manager was not around the staff asked me to look for the manager the next day nobody proactively came to look for me to address the issue i had to look for the manager and raise the issue again the manager offered me a free breakfast as compensation due to the fact that they did not communicate to me up front and did not bother to follow up gives me a just your luck suck it up impression i would if this is star hotel
