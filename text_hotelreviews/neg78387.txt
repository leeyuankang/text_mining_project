staff morale seems low but that is none of my business my first night was in superior single which i find not as good as standard single the bathroom is illogically designed there was a huge cabinet beside the shower stall and the shower stall was really small it is smaller than a public toilet cubicle very inconvenient and ruins the experience please get priorities right i love the standard single
