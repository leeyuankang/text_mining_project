size of the room was just perfect for a small child with no luggage the room was impossibly tiny and hotel staff couldn t move me not as advertised by booking com and definitely not worth the rate paid no room to even use the teeny tiny desk in the corner which was a major problem because i was on a work trip the shower didn t drain the tv didn t work well would randomly turn off over and over the bed was fairly uncomfortable and even a bit unstable and rickety though they were nice the hotel staff gave me some bad information about getting a vat refund which wasted my time you can t get a vat refund for hotel bills and the concierge staff should have known that the staff also didn t seem to know if breakfast was included or not hotel was advertised as having shuttle service from airport which was false they had room service but there was nowhere to eat the meal except on the bed and no place to put the tray
