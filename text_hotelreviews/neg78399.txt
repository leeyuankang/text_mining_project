booked a single room was placed next to the elevator so upon entering a constant hum asked to be moved given another room the single rooms are very small and compact i kept banging my arm on the small table next to the bed no proper sound proofing in the single room so i could hear the noise from the traffic as on a main road in london dont book a single room if you want to work as there is no space wifi kept dropping out so very difficult to work
