the size of the room has nothing to do with what is advertised the room did not have even and it was advertised for fact which i find not honest the furniture in the room is very old with old windows i asked for a silent room and got one facing the street although there are rooms facing the garden as well no adaptor in the room although it was obvious that we were from outside england it was provided following our request stil why not make it easier and offer it in the room there were pieces of hair in the shower otherwise very clean the heating system is old and noisy
