described by reception as a garden room our bedroom was basement front of hotel with views of the dustbins however the noise insulation was excellent and we were only aware of the passing traffic when we could see it in the morning breakfast was fine self service the menu offered many items not seen and staff made no effort to invite us to use the menu
