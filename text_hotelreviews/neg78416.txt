the bathroom had the beginnings of mould on the ceiling and the towel warmer was situated right next to the toilet which meant that my boyfriend burnt his leg on it we had to get them to turn it off we were told when checking in that we had been upgraded to a garden room which meant that there was a small concrete area with a table and chair connected to the room not what i would consider a garden and was a bit of a let down i imagine it would have meant more if we were smokers the addition of some plants at the least would go a long way
