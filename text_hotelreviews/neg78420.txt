breakfast is in a small room which got very hot there was not always a table available some guests left because they did not want to wait or sit in the rather dark bar for breakfast on my second day they were out of ham prosciutto and normal ham tomatoes croissants even after i asked it took them more than min to refill restock so i simply gave up also there was no genius plus goodie as promised when i booked the room very tiny shower
