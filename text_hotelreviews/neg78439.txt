after being out the whole day in london we came back to our room and it was not yet made up we got two bottles of cider in the hotel bar and took it to the room opening it the bottle neck of one of the bottles broke so could be discussed if that was my fault i used a proper bottle opener i believe the bottle had a defect what soever they could have replaced it for free but they made us pay the exchange bottle well it wouldn t have meant them going bankrupt and we would have been delighted of the generosity and is quite a high price
