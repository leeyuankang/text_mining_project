constant machine noise hum possibly refrigeration extraction laundry or generator next door looked like it was being renovated when we visited disturbed our sleep a little on the first night it wasn t loud but it was noticeable when we weren t moving around or watching tv but we soon got used to it so didn t feel the need to complain floorboards in room creaked a lot not a problem for us but might have been for those in rooms on floor below slightly questionable choice of bed covers many layers but that s probably just a matter of preference
