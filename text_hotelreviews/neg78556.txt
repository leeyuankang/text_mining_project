it was an exceptionally hot weekend in the high degrees the air con is really one of the radiator hybrid thing that is fitted under the window and as one knows that s good when it s emitting hot air rises but useless for cool air sinks in fact though set at degrees the temperature never fell below the low however it does serve as a fan function which is better than many non air conditioned accommodation in london the other problem was the threadbare really old and rough and tatty bathrobe for me if there is a bathrobe there needs to be slippers even disposable ones but there aren t and the condition of the bathrobe makes it very uncomfortable and abrasive to wear after a shower on your naked skin i would recommend either replacing or eliminating it the last issue i had was with the bed and i rarely criticise bedding as i am quite a versatile sleeper perhaps it s because it is a single bed for a single room so it has been easily misshapen by all the frequent uses basically it is a very soft bed that is very lightweight heavier better quality mattresses will hold its shape and position better placed against the wall this means that guests especially if they are more than average build will find themselves naturally leaning towards the right outer edge away from the wall thus the mattress is slanted and when i lay my size inches body on it to sleep i found myself having to stop myself from falling off the bed a few times rather disconcerting for those travelling with a car like in most parts of london parking is very limited if any expensive and restrictive
