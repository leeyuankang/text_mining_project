i booked as a business traveller and expected a desk or table to work the dressing table was too small to work on as part of it is taken up by the kettle and tea coffee there was no where to put my suitcase so i moved an armchair and rested my suitcase on the arms of the chair there is no where to put toiletries shampoo conditioner soap etc in the shower i had to put them on the floor i reported this twice but received no feedback i was not informed prior to my visit that there were renovations taking place in the hotel breakfast had to be taken in my room as a result but again no table on which to place the tray i also did not like the fact that the breakfast tray or the bowls plates on it were not covered from a hygiene point of view i would have preferred bowls to be covered with plastic wrap at least i would have liked two cups of coffee but was brought a single cup rather than a pot of coffee the bedside lamps point down illuminating the bedside tables but were useless in providing light for reading in bed
