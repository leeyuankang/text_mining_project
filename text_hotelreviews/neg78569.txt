with my room being at the back of the hotel i heard a humming noise that was quite distracting to me when i was trying to sleep room in fairness to the hotel i am someone who does not like white noise so others may not be as bothered by this as i was i asked the clerk about it the second night and after i did the noise seemed to dissipate the third night the humming noise was back and when i checked out i asked the clerk about it he said he could not say for sure but it may be the air conditioning unit of the building next door over which they have no control i would stay here again but would ask for a room on the front of the hotel
