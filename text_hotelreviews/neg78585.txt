the hotel staff seemed rather indifferent or rude as we came and left each day the only time that the staff seemed pleased was when we checked out on our last day i m not a very popular guy so this wasn t that big of a deal or surprise i did have an allergic reaction to what i believe was the detergent that the hotel used to launder the sheets this caused me to develop a rash over much of my torso however my girlfriend had no issues after this i decided that i am a weak human
