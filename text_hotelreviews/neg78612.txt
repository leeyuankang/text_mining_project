the hotel charged us for continental breakfast because we made the booking through booking com if we had not payed for breakfast in advance the price would have been just those small things thar irritates you when we pointed out the strange in this they would just shrug it of without giving any refund so it seems if you book through the any site they actually try to get some extra out of you just makes me mad
