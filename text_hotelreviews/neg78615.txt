the receptionist was rude unwelcoming and unhelpful the bed in the room was uncomfortable the bathroom was disgusting there were bugs in the shower and the shower had no soap handle which is very inconvenient and it had no temperature control for the water also the sink kept flooding and the toilet s flush wasn t working well the wifi kept disconnecting i do not recommend this boutique hotel as it s nowhere near a good four star hotel
