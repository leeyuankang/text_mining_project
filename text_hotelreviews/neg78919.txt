the hotel claim they have parking but when you arrive it s a ten minute walk away which was very stressful after a hour flight from johannesburg then a drive from heathrow they should make this clear also they wanted to keep off my credit card for a week for no reason at all when i complained they put it back in my account straight away this was all so very stressful when checking out if they hadn t have done this they would have got top marks as a stay
