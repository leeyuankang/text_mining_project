we interacted with the concierge on several occasions and i think he could have been more knowledgeable all staff are pleasant and courteous but they are still getting their feet under them as the hotel has only been open since last february so they are still a bit green food choices in the hotel are limited so if you don t like indian food your selections will be limited i have to say though my family are big fans of indian cuisine and they loved the restaurant in the hotel also the bar is amazing and there is also a lovely outdoor terrace there was very little we did not like about the hotel we will be back
