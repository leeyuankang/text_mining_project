on the second day of our stay the power kept on going out and we were left in the dark on and off for a good few hours we contacted the reception and we were informed that the electrician was working on it but the fluctuating power supply was affecting our work and we feared for our laptops and phones which were being charged when the power failures happened finally the power came on and we went into have a wash we had just come back from a very long day of sightseeing and badly needed a wash but couldn t because there was no power when we discovered that there was no hot water we were drenched in the rain and was chilled to the bone further delayed from a wash due to power failure so not being able to a nice long warm bath at the end of a tiring day pretty much ruined half of our trip there when the reception was contacted we were told that there was nothing they can do about it that is as helpful as they got basic amenities violated is not very good in a hotel small room would have liked a more spacious one
