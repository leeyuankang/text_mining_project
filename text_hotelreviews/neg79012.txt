the rooms were tiny it is almost impossible to live in it with an infant s crib installed the crib was not really a crib but a playpen due to the crib being installed there was no room left to keep our suitcases the baby s push chair or even to walk around the room the hot water kettle was filthy and looked like it had never been cleaned there was tea and coffee but no cups to drink them in the bathroom was almost the same size as the bedroom which means a lot of space has been wasted yet not a single shelf or storage space in the bathroom for any toiletries this is just a terribly designed property where the comfort of the guests have been totally ignored the air conditioner was switched off daily by the reception and then only after a phone call did the front office staff switch it on this was a daily affair we never returned to have the ac working this is a terrible way to save energy wonder why they can t invest in a keycard system the hotel lacks basic amenities like a dental kit laundry business center etc this should technically be a star property the check out took longer than usual and it was difficult for them to distinguish whether the credit card amount was blocked or charged so they did not know if it had to be reversed or just unblocked
