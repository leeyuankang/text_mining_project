overall i was really disappointed with my experience we were upgraded to a junior suite but it was disappointing the wall paper was coming away from the wall the shower didn t work properly i shower head didn t work and when you turned it on it came away from the wall the cushions looked grubby and i just didn t feel we got value for money we were attending the cinema there so booked the hotel as an extra on the saturday afternoon when we first arrived we couldn t get a seat in the bar as it is set out for groups all tables we occupied by couples and had so many seats left but not that were socially acceptable to sit on as others were at the table the leather seating at the bar was also tatty and needed replacing the tables at breakfast all wobbled and i don t mean a little wobble which could be fixed with a menu but were unstable to a point that you worried whilst cutting your food the food at breakfast was lovely but ruined by the tables which is not what you expect for a hotel i raised my concerns at check out but didn t feel they were addressed or listened too
