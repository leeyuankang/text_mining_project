we were upgraded to a suite which makes me wonder how small our room would have been if we hadn t been upgraded the room was tired and not particularly clean we were at the front of the property which was noisy and the back of our room over looked a nightclub so it was even noisier luckily our aircon unit was so loud that it drowned out most of the music and people shouting our bathroom smelt of raw sewage all of the time which was disgusting and made both of us wretch on entry to th bathroom breakfast was a very average buffet in a very tired room overall this hotel is very tired and needs a refurb we called concierge to ask for an iron which we had to chase as it didn t show up it still didn t show up at all and we had to then rush out for our dinner reservation in creased clothing the staff were underwhelming and no one even asked us on check out how our stay had been which makes me think that they know how bad it was waiting minutes at the concierge desk twice once for someone to show up to help and once while one person was on the phone to what sounded like a friend i am so disappointed by this hotel especially as it was our wedding anniversary weekend celebration i would actively recommend you don t book this hotel there is no redeeming features other than the central location
