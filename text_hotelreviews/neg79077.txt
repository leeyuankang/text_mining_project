we were extremely disappointed with the facilities of this hotel we had booked on the basis that it had a pool and spa facilities as we were expecting to be doing a lot of walking throughout the day so would be pleased just to get back to the hotel and relax in the evening we returned to the hotel after an extremely hot and tiring day only to find that the leisure suite closed at this resulted in us hurriedly rushing down to the pool where the staff indulged us in a minute swim we then decided to check out the rooftop bar which for us was the main highlight of this hotel and with such lovely weather it would be the icing on the cake we were denied access due to the bar being fully booked by people who weren t even staying in the hotel asked if we could maybe book for later on that evening but told no the whole evening is booked we were never advised that this facility was outsourced and so no priority given to guests staying at the hotel in fact quite the opposite applied to add insult the quirky inside bar was being used by a film club we decided to find an alternative place to eat and then more walking to try and find a nice place to relax for the evening we felt thoroughly cheated we had decided to pay more for our stay in london than we would usually to ensure a nice place to return to with good facilities and ended up feeling another time we could choose a cheaper hotel and book in advance to use the rooftop bar
