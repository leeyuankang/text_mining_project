i have stayed in better hotels than this hotel very disappointed as when i booked the room i explained that it was for our wedding anniversary but no reference was made to this at all very surprised that bathrobes were not included in the room for a hotel this should be the norm also when i filtered the search i asked for hotels with breakfast included this one came up but when i checked in i was told breakfast was not included however we went across the road the next morning for breakfast in a bar and had an excellent cooked breakfast for although the location was excellent i certainly would not use this hotel again
