for a star hotel i thought my room was tired and in need of a make over the material on the chair was worn the bed was uncomfortable with a cheap mattress the cushion was tatty and frayed there was a big gap of over an inch under the door which allowed light and noise into the room the bathroom was clean and decorated to a good standard however the towels had been well used and not what you would expect in a hotel with these ratings it might well be that this is not the case for all the rooms within the hotel and i may have just been unlucky i had a great trip but the above issues were disappointing because there were lots of positives about the hotel and staff
