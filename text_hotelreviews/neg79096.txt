first of all they changed our rooms to the penthouse as they had given our rooms to someone else which was in a seriously bad state of repair very rundown entrance door looked as if it had been battered shower room dirty and old baths which spat out filth when we ran a bath plaster falling from the walls no side lights besides the bed smelly old feather pillows this is supposed to be a five star hotel who in booking com gave them that level the personnel can barely understand english breakfast served in the old courtroom but in the style of a work canteen horribly expensive for such low standards final amusing comment when i asked if all the rooms were in such a bad state oh madame i believe we have one or two rooms which have been renovated
