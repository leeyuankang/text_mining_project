apart from the fact that the spa was absolutely tiny and barely had any facilities the spa was extremely shabby and in dire need of decoration the door to the sauna hit the floor so it made an awfully loud scraping noise every time the sauna door opened there were no bath robes provided in the spa i booked a massage and had to just wear a swimming costume with a towel wrapped around me
