we had a really disappointing time accessing the spa one of the main reasons we booked the hotel was the swimming pool when we went down to the pool there were no staff around we waited for but no one appeared we went to reception to let them know and they said they were probably doing treatments all we wanted was a key for a locker to put our clothes we were told to just persevere we tried for hours ringing the spa but with no luck i did ask reception if someone could look into it so we could use the pool the next day this did happen but trying to locate the spa staff was a nightmare we went down at as arranged but had to hang around until someone appeared it was really unfortunate we couldn t go when we wanted to and this was what let the overall experience of the hotel down i would have given it if it wasn t for the poor spa service access to facilities
