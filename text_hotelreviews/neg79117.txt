when we arrived minutes early to booking in time did nt expect to go to room straight away b ut had to wait a further minutes to book in as rooms were not ready i had specifically asked for a twin room but at reception a very pleasant young lady said they had upgraded us i don t know why so i said thats great as long as it was a twin room so when we finally got to the room after keys not working so another trip to reception to sort this out i was dismayed to find a double room be it very large the beds could come apart but the bedding did not allow this as we were only staying one night we did not bother to change rooms as time was precious as we had a show to see and only a few hours before we had to attend the show i was dissapointed as i had planned this stay as a special birthday treat as well as the theatre also as my friend was in recovery from a bad illness this is why i wanted a twin room to make her feel comfortable the bed was very comfortable and the room delightful but not what i asked for the next dissapointment was breakfast we went to breakfast at not too late nice dining room and asked immediately if we would like tea or coffee but nothing was explained to us that there was a menu for anything else that was on offer other than what was on the tables to serve yourself so as some items had run out on the hot selection i had to bring this to the attention of the waitress who was lovely but then told me it would be another minutes but in fact this was more likely minutes so had a cooked breakfast minus items then discovered a small menu under a plate also had cereal but first bowl i picked up was very chipped which is really not acceptable
