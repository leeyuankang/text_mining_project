very old hotel for sure needs some upgrading to be a five star at the most now four star hotel did not get my booking so we waited for over half an hour on check in day at not a fun start especially when travelling with a kid however staff was polite and tried their best to help the room was clean but again furnitures need upgrading to be called five star hotel on our stay the water was shut down for one day staff helped us move to another hotel
