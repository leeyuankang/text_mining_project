hotel is tired in need of major face lift our bathroom floor got very wet due to i ll fitted shower screen there were tiles missing from wall not what you expect from a hotel more like staff not overly responsive to complaints this is our visit to the hotel visit wasn t great either having to wait over a hour and half for our food in restaurant staff were not overly responsive then either it could do with good clean in reception saying that location is fabulous and that s about all hotel has going for it it s such a shame because it could be a wonderful hotel
