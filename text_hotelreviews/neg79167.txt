the breakfast experience was appalling this was a gift for my parents and i booked it partly because breakfast was included and it was really terrible there was no cutlery no plates the staff all seemed terribly rushed which we know can happen if they re busy and understaffed but seemed very disorganised and the the little food that was there was cold and disappointing after having to ask twice for numerous different parts of the breakfast my parents made a compliant on the way out to which they were told i would receive a refund i still havnt received this even after a few phone calls to the hotel
