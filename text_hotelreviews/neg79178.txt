breakfast was disappointing for a start hotel i ended up not taking breakfast at all after my first day experience the fruits didn t look fresh and the smoke salmon was dry as it they were prepared the night before and left uncovered i asked for yogurt and was given a small bow that was taken from another table it was rather shocking it took three days to change bed sheets and that was after i complained there was a big difference between the photos of the rooms on the website when i booked and what i ended up with that was rather disappointing i tend to book online a lot and usually the room tend to look pretty much the same as what is shown on line this was rather disappointing there was a big difference between the superior queen room that i saw on line and the one i ended up with i also had to request the hotel to vacuum clean the room twice on the same day after it had been cleaned the room was ok only that the didn t look like what was shown online and to me felt like a standard room rather than a supernatural queen room it s best to show exactly what they look like online
