i couldn t find anything in the hotel first i walked past the hotel on arrival as it is not clearly signposted then i had to ask where everything was the toilet the lifts the breakfast room and the restaurant nothing was signposted the room itself i would definitely class as star and i had booked a superior room i was disappointed and the rooms on the website look like more star and newer i was not happy paying a night the bed was big and looked inviting but as soon as you lay down on it you settle into a well formed hollow in the mattress so it was clearly fairly old the room was cold and there were no obvious instructions how the aircon worked when i pressed the arrow up nothing happened it just reverted back down to degrees i am sure if i had phoned reception they would have fixed it the towels were thin and worn if the property is a bit worn there are still small things you can do to really improve a stay such as new thicker towels and i would really expect a bathrobe in a star room the slippers provided were shabby the tv was great and the sky program selection but after a while the tv says it will automatically shut off after minute unless you press the ok button but there is no ok button on the remote control and none of the others work would also be nice to have a bedside lamp above the bed there were just ceiling spot lights it would also be a nice touch to provide a bottle of free water maybe some biscuits perhaps lay out a welcome information book i tried to find a menu for the restaurant but only found it on departure tucked away in a drawer you could also advertize the spa better by putting a leaflet out maybe offer a discount for residents i think the room should be spruced up mattress definitely replaced new carpet to give it a fresher colour change and with attention to the small things the impressions could be improved by
