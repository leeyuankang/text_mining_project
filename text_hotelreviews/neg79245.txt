the accommodation was very poor there was mold in the bathroom the shower wouldn t heat up and the handle fell off we asked for an iron and ironing board but the one that came was dirty covered in stains and very unsanitary the seat in the room was falling to pieces and the springs in the bed had collapsed in the middle after years and years of use
