where shall i start it says luxury at its finest on the key card holder but it is far from it average room in the attic with old furniture below average hot food at breakfast some staff rude broken sink surround in bathroom window did not open had to ask for room to be made up star hotel constant noise at night day from fan on roof etc etc i did write a complaint and duty manager instantly gave me discount which was good of him but general manager too busy to meet with me offering upgrades and free dinner via dm think he missed the point it was a treat from me based on a promise from him it is said that you get what you pay for not in this case i am following this up with the general manager and if necessary the owner as i would like my money back so that i can really treat my partner hope this helps you
