my room was on the road side with no extra glazing it was very noisy and i didn t get any sleep the shower is integral to the bath and unless you are inches or lower you cant really use it the breakfast has stewed scrambled egg with a thick film on it and the ambience of a train cafe rather than a five star hotel
