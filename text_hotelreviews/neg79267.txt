reception staff rude took deposit when the room had been paid in full in case of damage or if using the hotel facilities the restaurant was dirty we waited for each starter main course to arrive then our hot dessert s were half frozen in the middle the service was too slow not good in general i had paid for luxury queen room there was nothing spectacular or luxurious about it the bed was uncomfortable the room was a bit tatty frayed in places a big disappointment for a supposedly hotel i wouldn t give it for the amount of money i paid i expected a better hotel
