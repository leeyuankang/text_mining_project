would have been good to have known in advance that the roof terrace and downstairs bars were no go areas leaving very limited space for guests we were then told must line up in narrow space between rope and order and carry our drinks back not in its self a problem if had somewhere to take the drinks luckily a manager noticed our problem and guided us to a cell i had invited friends that also had a room for night as thought would be good to meet them on the roof terrace for drinks
