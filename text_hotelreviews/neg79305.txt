a room was ready for my arrival around am and even though it was next to the lift it wasn t too bad the room was really nice but the bed was very uncomfortable i could feel the springs in it and that wasn t good for my back at all my back is still hurting me someone had a key to my room and walked in whilst i was sleeping it was quite frightening to wake up to hear them coming in the room i did report it to reception at check out and was told that it would be investigated i haven t heard back from anyone as yet the tv was not easy to work out and it keep turning off after about an hour
