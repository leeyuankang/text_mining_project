our stay was going well until the electricity went off and couldn t find the emergency exits to get to the ground floor initially there was a lot of confused people trying to get out of the hotel and no staff on the floors to help us get out or work out how to get out what if it had been a fire people were stuck in the lifts even one lady looked worried and an elderly couple looked confused finally i found a dark staircase and decided to try that which finally led me to the ground floor trade men s entrance i walked round the block to get to the front of the hotel the staff apologised but said it wasn t there fault these things happen i explained it wasn t their fault regarding the electricity but it certainly their responsibility to make sure guests can exit the hotel
