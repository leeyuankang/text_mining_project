the place was a bit tatty missing toilet roll holders plates on electrical points around the bathroom sink hanging off in both rooms i stayed in i had to remove the plug from the bath with tweezers in one room because there was no chain i had to move rooms because the first room had very poorly fitting sash windows which provided no noise reduction from the street with rubbish collection trucks at each morning my room wasn t cleaned after leaving at and coming back to just minor things but they all added up the location is very hard to beat though
