lost my phone in the hotel and when i asked the staff they didn t seem that bothered but i perservered and eventually one of the managers found it with some story saying he was about to hand it in lost my confidence with the hotel a little but will stay here again also not enjoying the price hike on rooms should be some sort of loyalty scheme for regular guests
