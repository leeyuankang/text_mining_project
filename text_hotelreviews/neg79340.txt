since i paid a lot of money for the rooms i would have expected better service the rooms were not ready at as promised instead we were asked to wait in the lobby while they check if the rooms are ready we waited for minutes after which i went back to the receptionist to ask what was taking so long and she actually lied and said that she had looked for us in the lobby but did not find us that was just not true we had been sitting on the couches four people the whole time and i had been looking at the reception she definitely had not come look for us however at that point the other room was ready but they were still checking if they could give the other one as well well we happened to go past that room on our way to the other room and the cleaning had only just began it took another hour or so before the other room was finished all of this would have been understandable had they apologised and maybe offered drinks at the hotel bar while we were waiting but instead they chose to lie about the situation and not only once so got a bit of a rocky start which affected our whole stay in the end every hour was important since we only stayed a day in london
