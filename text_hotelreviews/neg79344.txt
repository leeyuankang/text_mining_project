the bar staff friday evening were a little short we were in the bar having drinks before we went to our rooms and the bar staff were quite rude it was late close to closing time but they made us feel uncomfortable which was a shame as we were all on a high from our first night being in the london but we met at the bar the next day and the service was a lot better for the rest of the weekend
