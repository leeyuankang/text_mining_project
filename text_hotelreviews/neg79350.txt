service at reception was poor could not find booking for minutes only one room available when checking in room so reception gave that room to our friends even though we did the booking we were allocated room later in the day the room was smaller than room and was extremely noisey preventing reasonable sleep why was i given the worst room when i made the booking and paid for it we were told it was a room upgrade so i dread to think what the original room was like paid for the room was not worth would like a refund please
