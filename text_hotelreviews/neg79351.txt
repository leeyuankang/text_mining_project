almost everything could have been better we have been staying at the courthouse for years so over visits it used to be a fantastic hotel in every respect however it is well over due for a refurb it is tatty and tired no excuse for painted walls to look shabby rooms are dated and tatty bed was in need of throwing out together with the bed linen it was appalling usually this hotel provide little touches that i have found as standard all over the world robes toiletries and a fresh set of towels each day we had to ask for house keeping to visit the room not best pleased staff were fairly helpful but also seemed miserable and fully aware the hotel was not up to standard we were told as much by the supervisor who offered a free upgrade to a magistrate suite as she was used to guests complaining we refused the upgrade as it was far worse than the room we already had all in all we came back because of location but even years ago it was looking bad but we used to love this hotel so went back we will not be returning until it is refurbished i have only left feedback because i would hate for this hotel to be a let down for that special anniversary or birthday the hotel cost us for nights not the most expensive nor the cheapest but for less money we could have stayed somewhere that was in less of a state inside
