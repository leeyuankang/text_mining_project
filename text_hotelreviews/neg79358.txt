this is one of those tick box hotels stars mean xyz tick all those nice touches that one expects from a star hotel forget it a bit of thought on furniture free water fruit decent minibar gin vodka etc not just two cans of cheap lager bath robes forget it even trying to get a morning paper was just way too much to ask they know what the minimum is for the star and keep to the minimum no extra effort if it is the cheapest in the west end by all means go for it but i have stayed at better places withing half a mile over the last years
