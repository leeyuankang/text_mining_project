when i checked in i was given a tiny tiny room had my stay been one night i would have stayed and never gone back as it was the next morning i told the front desk manager that my room was unacceptable even for one night and i had three more to go he said pack your things and check when you return that they would find another room if possible they did i moved that s all great but more importantly the attitude of the staff and their willingness to intervene i would absolutely recommend the hotel
