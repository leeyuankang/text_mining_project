i did not like that the hotel was very run down the wallpaper coming away from the corridor walls and that i could hardly see the sign to tell us that this was a hotel and a dirty rug as you walk in i stayed in barcelona stars and this was a star compared to this and that was cheaper the staff were nice enough seriously they need to get rid of the sofas and the lift broke down when i was in it i was really scared and the room view could not get any worse than an office block so you had to close the curtains but don t expect an amazing view in london just buildings
