some of the staff including the bar staff were very rude the service overall was poor for this standard of hotel we had booked a reservation for dinner but the reservation was lost we had booked for the cinema but the reservation was lost the concierge should have resolved these things as we were guests at the hotel but didn t seem too bothered and left us to resolve ourselves the sky bar was also out of use for a function one of the reasons we booked overall this hotel wasn t worth the money we spent to have a little bit of luxury in london
