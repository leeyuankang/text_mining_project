the only slight thing i could comment on as a slight negative about the hotel was furniture in the breakfast room were a little wobbly and some of the chairs had marks on them with everything else about the hotel being so amazing this would be the only thing that in my eyes that didn t quite live up to the rest of the hotel standard having said that i d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thanks for a lovely stay
