had to wait for over an hour for our room to be ready not fun after a long trip staff were unfriendly and unhelpful as we had to ask many questions as nothing was explained how to get to the rooms concierge to have our bags breakfast and dinner etc felt as if we had to keep asking questions and annoying them when we entered the hotel must have been a gathering or conference on as the lobby area was a terrible mess empty food drinks bags and rubbish everywhere the toilets were an awful mess i didn t even attempt to use them as they were disgusting no toilet rolls no paper towels to wipe hands with and mess everywhere breakfast was ordered to the room after waiting an hour we called and they said we had about another wait we had only ordered toast and cereals check out again was a hassle as we had to go through and check the bill as many discrepancies be warned even if you pay over for a suite the mini bar is not included
