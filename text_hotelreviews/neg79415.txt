we stayed here when it was run by hilton a few years ago and it was the finishing touches that were missing this time things were broken in our room like the shower head a bedside lamp didn t work and there was no information in the room about the hotel facilities e g the spa i went for a swim and was told that i couldn t use a locker as they had too many clients that day i should have argued that i was a paying customer but was too shocked to respond in addition we were never asked at the end of our stay whether everything was alright in our room and no feedback card either it seemed to have lost its sparkle
