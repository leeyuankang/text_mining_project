the staff were very rude and unhelpful hours post check out i noted they had charged me twice for the nights accommodation i immediately rang them the staff member that answered my call was not able to tell me when my money would be returned to my account and was very unhelpful she was difficult to hear on the phone and insipid in her responses to my questions on requesting to speak with her manager she stated that that was not possible but he would call me back however as i was an international traveller i only had a mobile i which i was informed that they could not ring a mobile number i stated that that was ridiculous and insisted that they call me the manager did return my call and was very rude implying i had clearly never stayed at a star hotel and this is what they did all the time it appears his staff failed to tell me that they process your bill on arrival and then if you pay with another form of credit on check out you are charged twice and have to wait days for your money to be reaccredited to your account thankfully we did not require that money immediately overall very poor customer service and as a result we will not stay or recommend this hotel
