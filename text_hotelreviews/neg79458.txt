the room had ripped carpet the furniture was scratched and worn there was only one teabag for each of us to have cup of tea for the whole stay the mattress was extremely uncomfortable for the gap between the two singles place together was annoying the lighting in the room was poor after having inroom dining at we returned home at to find the plates still outside the door no information of services within the hotel and no iron and ironing board in the room for a price tag of this calibre there needs to be a great improvement i have had better service and conditions in an ibis hotel
