i have stayed here occasionally over years the breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling the cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs the magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else there used to be an omelette area that s gone too for warm food you have to choose off theo randall s italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices if the food we had was a reflection don t even bother the fried rosti tasted like a brick service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor if this is ihg s flagship hotel in london then unfortunately the star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast i guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs go across to the serpentine caf for a better breakfast also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies so beware if you are not so mobile we will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in london in the future
