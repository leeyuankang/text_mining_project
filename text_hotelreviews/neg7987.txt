the room was below expectations although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street when we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com for this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity it was a definete disappointment on our part my advice is either pay a bit more and prefer seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton they re all away from each other having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm
