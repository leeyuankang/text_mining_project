my biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests rarely have i spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me the rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay
