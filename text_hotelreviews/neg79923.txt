the neighbourhood was pretty quiet at night but not too convenient if you re looking for somewhere close to the coach station or sites the elevator is very small it s fine when you re my size and on your own but not so convenient for two women with luggage in tow we had to take it up one at a time to our rooms with our luggage and the elevator runs pretty slowly so it took a few minutes to go up and come back down the walls of the hotel are somewhat thin you can hear when people walk past your room other than that we didn t have any issues with the accommodations themselves and we had a great time
