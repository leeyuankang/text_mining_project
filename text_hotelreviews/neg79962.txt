one of the receptionists gave us the wrong information so we had to walk back in the opposite direction quite a long way to get to the right bus stop although furnishings were great the carpet on the floor was very stained looked quite disgusting and the walls were marked the towel rack was on all the time you could not turn it off or down and although there is a warning sign because the bathroom is small i burnt my arm a few times as i accidentally bumped it
