ridiculously small single bedroom in a cellar not even in the main hotel with no windows i was unable to stand up in the bathroom to shower or use the toilet i had to wait minutes for a table to come free for breakfast mid week stay due to particularly small restaurant area i had to wait an exorbitantly long time to be attended to by the hotel receptionist who was more interested in giving some new foreign visitors to london a full run down on attractions worth visiting and made no apology for keeping me waiting
