arriving after an overnight flight to find the room i had arranged was not available even after a long email exchange on the matter meaning that staff members had to sleep together even though inappropriate because a cot would not fit but still being charged for an upgrade the sinks were clogged and the temperature controls had no effect i also had suspicious bug bites each night when i showed them to staff they asked for my email to follow up and i never heard anything after that
