wifi in lower floor very weak the alarm fired times during the night and apparently first time due to someone smoking in a room okay understandable but the other times were reception dixit because staff didn t reset properly the alarm horrible night with the alarm just in my room needing to work the next day not recommended experience to people with heart sickness things like this someone skipping smoking rules can happen eventually of course but other establishment will compensate you not charging you a breakfast for example if it s something redundant during the night not such gestures here unfortunately
