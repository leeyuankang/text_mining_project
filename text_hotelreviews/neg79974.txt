we son t see how this hotel is star rated room was small no lounge to sit in and the breakfast area is a joke with only eleven tables sitting people max so pot luck if you can get a seat no other meals offerred my wife asked for an egg cup but the staff did not understand what she meant so she bought one to use for the rest of the stay a best weston hotel with no egg cups wireless internet is dire so we used the costa starbucks around the corner which had good internet lift is incredibly small with only room for one person and one case hotel is fine if all you want is a bed to sleep in after a day out but no other reason to visit
