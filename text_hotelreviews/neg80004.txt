bed is not the most comfortable the wifi is horrible very slow with having to fill in email address name and room number each time although breakfast had a good variety it is better to get in earlier as some stuff will not be refilled after so if you want the good stuff don t sleep in no fridge in the room and it is pretty small with two large bags it is a struggle getting ready in the morning bathroom is also small with no toilet roll holder this hotel should probably be rated as a star hotel
