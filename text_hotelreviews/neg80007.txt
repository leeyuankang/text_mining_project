the hotel was very noisy didn t get much sleep due to doors being open and closed could hear people in the corridor throughout the night and cleaner early the next morning also as not double glazed could hear people outside and the traffic there was quite a big gap under the door so the light from the corridor shone through this is why i have not given a good score for comfort even though the bed was comfortable it was ruined by the noise
