our room was very warm even with a c and didnt have the best view the mini bar in the fridge was very expensive for a kitkat and for a bottle of water though i guess that the majority of patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water the buffet style breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication
