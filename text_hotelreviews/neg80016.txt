bathroom was small sink was blocked and the fan didn t work breakfast room was cramped very small without much room at all food was okay but you had to serve yourself and wait for some as it wasn t always ready on the plates so other food got cold on your plate too many people with just one person giving help had to ask three times for some tea three times for a glass to put some juice in and it felt as if you were a problem in all it wasn t worth the money a small over crowded place without room to swing a cat i won t go there again
