water runs out in the morning so we had to shower extra early of the mornings we had to shower with cold water the lady at the reception never heard it before but did suggest we beter shower earlier or on another time she said she would have somebody take a look at it but that personen didnt found anything off and nothing was wrong we did not feel taken seriously i think the hotel works with an reservoir that contains an max of warm water not done for a night she could at least be honest about it
