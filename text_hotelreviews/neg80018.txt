we had a bookings com discount we feel because of this we didn t have a good room our room was in the basement at the front where staff worked there was a bright light all night outside the windows the concierge was kind enough to give us a discount we would have preferred a good room we would not go back from this experience so the hotel has lost out on an opportunity we don t believe bookings com discounts deliver added value quite the opposite
