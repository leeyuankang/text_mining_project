the full booking room rate for our night stay was taken out of our credit card prior to arrival which was disappointing as i booked through my australian credit card but intended to pay in pounds the room was tiny and in the basement the bed was against the wall so access for two people was very inconvenient one staff member never bothered to even look up to acknowledge us on arrival or departure which appeared very rude and gave us security concerns as anyone could walk in unchallenged
