our bed was up against a wall due to the bathroom door being next to it this made the bed not overly comfortable space wise for two people but perfectly manageable and a good mattress i m sure all the other rooms are different layouts so wouldn t be a problem the breakfast was great but he breakfast service was poor as the dining room only had two groups of people yet all the tables had dirty plates on the food was fab but the presentation meant there was not much out at one time and the staff were constantly replenishing the food thus not clearing tables etc
