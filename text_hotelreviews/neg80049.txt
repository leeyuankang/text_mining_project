the beds were so soft and not firm at all so you would sink when you lay on them i am small person and in weight so it s definitely not me the bed was exceedingly small in size and not representative of normal hotel bed sizes the doors on the bedroom do not do much to block out the sounds of the hotel hallways and you can hear each and every guest or staff walk past your room the bathrooms were small and only had showers in them the hotel only gave large towel per room which i thought odd and not standard hotel policy for london
