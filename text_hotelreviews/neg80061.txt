we were given a room on the basement floor and it was the worst hotel experience in my life the cell phone signal tended to die out a lot in the room i had to constantly go to the ground floor to make phone calls the wi fi didn t work percent of the time and when it did work it was only for a minute or two due to the room being basically underground it was constantly dark and the lamps didn t give sufficient light the constant semi darkness was extremely depressing to be fair there was a window in the room but it overlooked some rubbish bins or something like that in a basement and there were constantly people poking around those bins so we had to keep the curtains closed which again led to the problem of not enough light and the absolutely worst thing is that either the guests or the stuff of the hotel used this corner of the basement as a place for smoking and we constantly had the terrible smell of smoke all over our room my mother having asthma had to double her inhaler usage and i had to take anti allergy pills
