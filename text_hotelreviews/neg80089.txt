this was the worst hotel i ve ever stayed in during my life the first room they gave me lower ground floor means basement was tiny dark and dingy and right by the steps from the street down to the staff entrance so the staff had a nice view of my room and me the internet connection wouldn t work in that room so next day they moved me to a room on the floor which was marginally brighter but still tiny and the day after the internet was down for the whole day a disaster as i had urgent work to do the room was noisy you could hear people in other rooms using the shower and running water the bed was seriously uncomfortable at the prices they charge it was a total disgrace how it ever got a rating is way beyond me
