terrible beds ridiculously soft saggy old mattresses with springs that i could feel digging into me also shorter than a regular bed would have been terrible for anyone taller than me i am ft and my feet were on the end of it in addition there was what i can only describe as a super thermal winter duvet in summer making it so incredibly hot that i could not sleep under it even with the noisy air con set to very cold i literally have never known a duvet like it it belongs in the arctic there were no sheets either so it was either super hot duvet or nothing the bed and duvet meant that i had an absolutely horrific night of barely any sleep room was also unbelievably tiny and the corridors etc are the same giving it a bit of a b and b feel considering we paid it was not good at all and breakfast would have added another but we decided against it some staff were unfriendly but then perhaps i wasn t in the best mood to judge them kindly after such a horrible sleepless night no mini bar or fridge either i would not stay there again
