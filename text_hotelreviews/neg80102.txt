i had reserved online through booking com two rooms a double room for my parents and a single room for a friend of theirs i had booked both rooms as refundable on purpose if anything came up in the four months prior to their stay reading more reviews on the hotel in different portals i got worried about feedback on the size of the rooms and decided to go and take a look myself as i wanted my parents to be as comfortable as possible the lady at reception was friendly and showed me two rooms the size of the double room was ok but the single room felt really claustrophobic besides there was nothing warm or welcoming abt the place and i absolutely did not want my parents to stay there when i got home i discovered that i had made a mistake and only the double room was fully refundable while the single room was on a non refundable rate i called booking com right away and asked for advice they were very friendly and told me that most hotels agree to returning the money nonetheless which is in their discretion especially if there is still to resell the room and the booking had just been made a few days ago i phoned the hotel straight away and they told me they would not be willing to let me off the hook i then walked by another day in the hope to have a better dialogue in person and the answer remained the same i did find a hotel nearby the cranley hotel bina gardens for about the same price which was absolutely delightful with tasteful big rooms where my parents had a wonderful stay i can only recommend to anyone looking for a room to look elsewhere it s unbelievable how different a package you can get for the same price
