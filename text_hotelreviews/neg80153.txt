it is advertised as a hotel but that s criminal misrepresentation to be honest i was put in a dungeon of a room with a loo squashed against a wall a shower i couldn t stand up in and a tiny single bed the wifi didn t work painfully slow kept cutting out the tv aerial was broken no tv at all not even terrestrial and i couldn t work out how to let the water out of the bath they don t even provide glasses so you can have a glass of water
