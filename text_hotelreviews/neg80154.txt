although the buffet breakfast was good the cooked food was lukewarm at best maybe the temperature of the heaters on the unit needs to be cranked up the hotel had free wifi which is excellent but you need to get a new password every hours which is a bit of a hassle on the day of our check out the tv mysteriously stopped working and wouldn t show any channels and the fire alarm went off in our room only i think these are fairly underhand tactics to get you out of your room before the checkout time which is too early in my opinion
