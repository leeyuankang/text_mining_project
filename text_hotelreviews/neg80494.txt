i booked couple of weeks before travelling and i ended up in a microscopic room that was probably no more than quite frankly for gpb per night the room i got was ridiculous and i say it having been in london many times for business in this category of hotel it was only there for one night but i was annoyed nonetheless as i purposely avoided other less expensive hotels exactly not to end up sleeping in a cage i made my point to the reception at check out and they kindly offered to do better next time which is of course nice but maybe it would have been more appropriate to warn me upon arrival and maybe offer a discount at the point i was asked to pay at check in since i can t possibly believe the one i had was a standard room for single occupancy
