the bed and the rooms were awfully small especially the one with the stairs it was ridiculous the showers in the bathroom were too short we had to bend down to wash our hair we could listen to everything outside of the room there arent any mirrors in the room not even slippers and the cleaning lady took a white dress my wife left on the chair mistaking it for towels and when i called they said they ll look for it and get back to me and that was it no feedback and i didnt get it back there was one elevator for service and customers and it was so slow we had to wait for it to come back empty so we could go up or down and the roof of the room was so short if i lift my hand i could touch the wall and i know there are many guys taller than me i think they should crawl around the room l the bed was small for ppl and not comfortable and thats after we changed our room times to find something habitable oh and dont bother spraying perfume youll get to the lobby and start smelling like lobster after that
