i didn t think the cooked breakfast was fantastic especially for a vegetarian i e bbq beans service very poor by not replacing plates and cutlery when taken away never got asked if we would like more tea coffee our room was next to noisy generators and in the morning you could smell the cooked breakfast through the air conditioning the pillows were like rocks and very uncomfortable and the bar did not stay open after which i thought was poor as we were looking forward to having as drink at the hotel
