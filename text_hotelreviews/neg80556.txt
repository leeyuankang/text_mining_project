i booked a single deluxe room when i entered the room i was very shocked by the size of the room which was like a shoe box there was no closets in the room and the single bed which they said was a queen size bed which took up the entire room and there was hardly any room to move around the bathroom was very tiny and hard to move around for the rates they are charging like pounds pounds per night the rooms are very much disappointing and later i had to pay additional money to upgrade to a bigger room i will not stay in this hotel anymore a the rooms are tiny and they charge way too much for the rooms it was more like a star hotel and radisson brand needs to upgrade the room sizes in this hotel if they want to maintain their standard very much disappointing
