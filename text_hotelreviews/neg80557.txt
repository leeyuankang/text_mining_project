if you always wanted to work on a submarine this would suit you the hallway is very small just enough room for myself and my one piece of luggage the room i got was so small it should have been called a cupboard i could reach the ceiling with my palm and had to stop low to get to the door of the room on a half floor the elevator made all sorts of interesting noises and you never knew what it would do overpriced and aweful i will never use this hotel again and would not recommend it
