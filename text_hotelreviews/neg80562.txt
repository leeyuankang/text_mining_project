the hotel is quite old the staff though very friendly are not very helpful with the exception of italian georgina i think that s her name who was great and super helpful during the day the breakfast was very poor the pancakes weren t fresh the avocado if mashed was not avocado but a dip etc at night the room service is awful i had to ask for a cheese sandwich and it was the worst sandwich i ever had in my life it wasn t even a slice of cheese it was a sort of scrambled cheese almost every day i had to call to ask for toilet paper
