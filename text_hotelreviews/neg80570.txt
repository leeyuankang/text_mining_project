the rooms are not worth the price not that comfortable noisy look like they are slightly run out not clean but most of all i had a very bad experience at check in with two members of the staff the person at the check in assigned me to a very small room definitely not looking like the standard double room i had booked and paid for but rather a single room single bed hardly any space to open my luggage etc after i complained this person insisted that this was a double room so did his colleague at the reception one of the managers on duty that night the latter even told me you are actually lucky to have got a room in this hotel tonight i had booked months ahead this person was extremely rude to me and the situation was outrageous i was simply sent back to the room it was over by that time and advised to pack up for the next morning in case they could assign me to a different room during the day fortunately and referring to the positive points the next morning i spoke to another manager who immediately did his best and was able to sort this issue and assign me to a different standard double room
