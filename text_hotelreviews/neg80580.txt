i had requested a quiet room because i sleep lightly but i did not expect to be placed in a very small room which i had to use steps to get down to the bed a very tiny room which did not reflect what was advertised i recognized that space is a premium in that area but the room was not worth the price there was barely any space to turn around in this room
