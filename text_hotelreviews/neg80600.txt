first single room i had was exceptionally small and hard for me to move around in so i did upgrade to a larger room as i was staying nights was not impressed with the steak and lobster restaurant for dinner it seemed odd that that was all you could order at dinner time when the room service menu was much more extensive coffee was frequently cold at breakfast as they seem to make a number of pots in advance and not to order ask for a pot of hot coffee and the staff will accommodate one slow elevator for both guests and service personnel is not enough and was quite frustrating at times
