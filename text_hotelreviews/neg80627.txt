travelling with adult daughter first night room was minute couldn t even put suitcase down had to climb over suitcase to get into the smallest bathroom this was most unpleasant and not expected when booking thankfully room was great in size major concern was overwhelming smell from smokers although windows were closed possibly drifting up from below as we were situated over front entry where smokers congregate or from other rooms
