i think i got the smallest room available the room was in the emergency stairs which seems a bit exaggerated i can understand that you need to optimize space to increase your income but this was much worse than i expected especially for the rate of this hotel staff was unable to extend one more additional day because the hotel was completely booked not even my room was available for the day after breakfast was little under standard i had better at lower star hotels in the outer of london
