i literally think we had the worst room the floor was uneven and we both fell over approx times each the bathroom looked like a converted cupboard it must have been mtrs long by wide terrible we had a view of a wall had to side step to get to the other side of the bed as it was about away from wall breakfast was a shambles we had to ask people for some coffee no bowls and when i asked a member of staff for one she had no idea what i asked for and had to ask someone else as she couldn t understand me people had to wait for breakfast tables to be cleared as they weren t efficient for just short of a night and stars i expected more from such a reputable brand
