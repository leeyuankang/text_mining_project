my daughter doesn t like lifts so we used the stairs to go up and down to our fourth floor room which was not a problem however i would not like to be staying in any of the rooms that come off the stairwell as any sounds footsteps travel also if you were any taller than our frames it would ve been very difficult to have a shower with the lower ceilings of the fourth floor rooms
