very disappointed with my room my single room was extremely small and cramped no view only a brick wall with huge metal chimney flues which i assume were coming from the kitchen area and these were covered with pigeon droppings i needed to open the window for some fresh air as the small room was very stuffy but there were cooking smells wafting through the window such a shame as the hotel itself was really lovely not much selection on evening menu for vegetarians
