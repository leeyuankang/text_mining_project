so disappointed not a star hotel at all more like a fancy bed and breakfast i stayed at hendon hall which is mins away a few days before and that was more like a four star hotel no room service no decent view no restaurant except breakfast in the morning if you ask for something to be bought up to the room expect hesitation like they don t want to do it they ll bring it up in the end but it s like they re doing you a favor
