we checked in we were given a room in the gatehouse section of the hotel now i know the hotel was not busy it was boxing day and only one other guests car in the car park yet we were dumped in the cold damp section of the hotel probably best only used for the busy summer tourist season the wallpaper was splitting at the seams and peeling from the wall there were cracks all over the ceiling the bathroom although recently refitted was obviously done by cheap unskilled labour i could press the large tiles under the mirror and they would bow and flex into the void behind them though i did not do this too much as i feared the large mirror would come crashing down the grouting was terrible too or even completely missing the small wooden threshold bordering the bedroom carpet to the bathroom tiles was bowed so every time i stood on it it would flatten down leaving the nail head to stick up very nice for when you walk into the bathroom barefooted but most of all it was cold and damp we stayed in the room an hour and a half but we could not get heat into the room and were not only not satisfied i was annoyed at being mugged off i complained and one of the ladies on the desk seemed a little snobby to start with though she did show us two rooms inside the main building and eventually gave us a free upgrade to a superior room which was warm and comfortable and well decorated but why do hotel do this i thought it was just me but the more people i talk to this seems common practice to give out the crappy rooms first the second lady on reception even admitted she did not like the gatehouse room when she helped us with our luggage yet she was the one who had initially booked us in and chose the room i have a rule now if i have to complain about the room i never use the hotel again the other thing though minor compared to the room is they have no hot breakfast just a continental breakfast
