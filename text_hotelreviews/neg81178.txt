t wasn t until i got home that i realised that i had booked a queen room and it was quite clear that the room was a standard double in fact compared to the photos advertised it felt like we d been given the smallest room available the walls are very thin and people walking the corridors at night and early morning could be easily heard overall i have been left rather disappointed by the experience
