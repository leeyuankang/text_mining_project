the male concierge working on reception when i checked out at was very off hand and explained that he was about to leave when i arrived in reception as if i was an inconvenience it was raining outside and i had a heavy bag to carry up the steps to the car park there was no offer of any help he just watched me struggle its a shame as it put a downer on what was otherwise a very pleasant stay
