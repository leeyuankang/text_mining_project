check in was quite poor i modified my booking via bookings com at least months prior to arrival however the hotel had no record of these changes this is the second time that i have stayed at the pillar hotel and the reception staff tried to indicate that the previous booking from was the same as the booking which wasn t even in the same name it took far too long for reception to sort out whatever needed to be sorted out at their end before providing the room key also as with the previous booking we had to ask to change rooms after only a few days the rooms don t appear to be maintained as expected as the bathroom tiles were cracked and the floor moved thus creating a health problem as you could not step out of the shower with bare feet we were offered the room next door which had the same issue although to a lesser extent the room that we moved to did not have a working safe and maintenance was not available until the next day every morning we had to call reception for amenities whether it be towels toilet paper tissues etc as housekeeping didn t replace these as expected also every day the shower mat was placed inside the wet shower making it sopping wet and unusable there was no business centre with a computer and printing facility that could be used by guests and the staff were very inquisitive as to why such services were needed which frankly is none of their business they tried to assist in locating an internet cafe but where they sent me did not exist as one of the few decent hotels in the area it would be expected that a corner of the hotel should be converted into a business centre to allow guests to have access to necessary services that cannot be accessed via tablets
