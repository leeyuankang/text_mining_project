we had to depart early because my husband s mother passed away unexpectedly the hotel which had not been prepaid would not waive the cost of the final night they claimed it was because they had to pay a commission to booking com i spoke to people about this and offered to pay the commission but to no avail i was very disappointed with their lack of compassion i will also add to this my disappointment with booking com for its inflexibility in these matters
