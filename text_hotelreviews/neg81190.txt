when we arrived at hotel the bathroom was dirty it looked like there was excrement on the floor i didn t examine closely enough to be sure when we complained to front desk instead of being apologetic they seemed to be insulted by our complaint and had the audacity to say that it couldn t have been there when we got the room and it must have been us their attitude totally wound my wife and i up and it put a proper dampener on our weekend away
