when we arrived we were given a room which was already occupied this was quickly rectified however as an apology we were offered a free meal in one of the hotel s restaurants the next night we made our choice of restaurant and made a reservation only to find that when we arrived at the restaurant it was closed that night something the staff should have told us when we tried make our reservation
