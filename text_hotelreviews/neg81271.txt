the spray for pillows to help you sleep was not in the room i called reception to ask for it and they promised to send to my room it never arrived such a small thing but having stayed at hotel before and used this spray had been looking forward to the great sleep that followed most unimpressed with the staff member at reception at around on friday march saying she would send requested item but didn t bother doing so i expect staff to follow through on their assurances to guests most disappointing has tainted my opinion of this hotel and makes me wonder whether other requests would also have been ignored
