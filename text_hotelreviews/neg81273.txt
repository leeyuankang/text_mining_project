i was surprised to see that preauthorisation was not released on my checkout date when the payment was executed but days later i contacted by phone the guest relations manager who blamed the bank for the delay but the truth was that the hotel had given the release order days after the checkout date as being informed by the bank if this is the policy of the hotel it would be better for the client to be aware of it and not be misleaded i sent an urgent email to the manager about this issue and he replied after days very disappointed by their professionalism
