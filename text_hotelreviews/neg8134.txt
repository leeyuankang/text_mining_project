location is in a very economically depressed area there were over homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro the rooms have paper thin walls i not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until in the morning it was so bad i could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed
