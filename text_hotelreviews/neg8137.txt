the location of this hotel is horrible when we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood this hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around when we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station we felt very insecure staffs were okay but i feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling few of them were just lazy with their answers also they don t really smile
