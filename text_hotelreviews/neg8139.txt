the area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless while we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe the hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc we did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel so this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there we opted to taxi in most of the time
