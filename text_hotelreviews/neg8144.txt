where should i start this hotel is rated a star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families the metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area it looks like a war zone the area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel it is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel you have to take taxi to ensure your safety i do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced i asked for a refund and management refused this hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in paris
