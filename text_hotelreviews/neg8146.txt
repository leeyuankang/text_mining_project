too noisy in the street by night nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until am room too hot area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant min walk
