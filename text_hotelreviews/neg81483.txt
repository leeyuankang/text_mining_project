i found my room was very poorly distributed in terms of space it becomes very uncomfortable a door impossible to open and which closes automatically behind you divides the bedroom from the entrance and bathroom toilet area you have to cope with that door several times a day bathroom and toilet are very oppressive breakfast is and certainly not worth it apart from these two points i d say this is a nice hotel
