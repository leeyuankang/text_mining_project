staff was less helpful than i have encountered in other parisian hotels we didn t ask for help though and tend to keep to ourselves so it may be different if you approach them more even leaving at am there was no offer to help us with airport transportation the bar set up is weird not sure how you d even get a drink but it didn t matter because so many things were nearby the pillows were beyond flat this is probably my only real complaint and one night the street was extremely noisy con of a popular area
