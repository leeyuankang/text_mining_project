well as i had a room at the front if you could organise for the local rubbish lorry to either pick up later or do it more quietly that would be amazing it woke me up very early each morning with all the banging and crashing not the hotel s fault but it was a tad annoying i will stay at the hotel again as very good but will request a room at the back and hope that is quieter
