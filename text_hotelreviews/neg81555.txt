when we left we asked the front desk for a taxi and thought we would be informed when the taxi arrived as we always do therefore we just sat in the lobby and waited no one told us that we actually needed to stay outside and kept an eye on the taxi by ourselves we missed the taxi and it took minutes until we finally got a drive we missed the train
