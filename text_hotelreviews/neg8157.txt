location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible and in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people this made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e no tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room
