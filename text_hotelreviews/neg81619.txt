the room doors were loud they would slam shut so every time someone left came back to their room you could hear it the walls indoors were pretty thin so you could hear everything going on although i couldn t hear anything from the outside also i was here on business and the wi fi didn t work from my room it was extremely frustrating the only place it worked was on the bottom floor i think they only had one router for the entire hotel i would reconsider staying here for business again the breakfast was okay but in my opinion it s better to go to one of the delicious bakeries or creperies down the street
