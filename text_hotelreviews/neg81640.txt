i made the reservation throughout my personal booking account but explicitly on the name of my husband i e his name was officially on the reservation as guest of the hotel nevertheless initially the reception refused to let him in the room and started to request copy of my passport and other info quite unpleasant after a long tiring trip and hard business day
