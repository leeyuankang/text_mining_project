two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts
