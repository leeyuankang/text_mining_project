the price is more relative to the location than the hotel although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times a small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room this didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others
