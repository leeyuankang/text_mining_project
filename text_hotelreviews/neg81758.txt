the commun area are not really large the breakfast area is tiny so is also the breakfast buffet as there is absolutely no room for a big large buffet everything is in miniature tiny croissant tiny viennoiserie tiny cup of coffee so if you are looking for a gargantuesque breakfast this one is not for you but for a light good breakfast it is ok it is not expensive as it is per person but in comparaison with the normal rate of the room a night the breakfast would for sure need to be improved and offer much more choice
