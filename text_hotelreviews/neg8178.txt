very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood never even try to book there there were people using drugs just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us the staff was not helpful and grumpy on top of this the tv was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of paris right next to the dumping ground a big no if you want to stay safe
