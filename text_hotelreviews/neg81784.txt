i prepaid with booking com yet the hotel had my partner pay again in cash on checkout whilst i was in the room i queried this and showed the confirmation email of payment from booking com but the receptionist absolutely insisted it wasn t prepaid on returning home as my credit card had obviously been charged previously i reclaimed from booking com who refunded less than they initially charged to it i ve followed it up times now and still haven t been refunded in full so down through no fault of my own
