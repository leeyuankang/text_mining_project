the toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell there is no aircon lucky for us it was cool weather but i can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable the area is not safe we walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us we just kept walking faster and went into the metro station it was very scary as we had our month old baby with us we are so grateful the man did not hurt us
