room was claustrophobic a cramped sleeping quarter cm on the left of the bed cm at the foot my husband and i had to make sure not to move at the same time in the room then a sort of corridor with a sofa and bathroom wc view on a concrete wall in fact the whole hotel was too small too cramped too dark one could call it a bed and breakfast without a breakfast room corridor to stuffy and hot lift miniscule not euros worth i am afraid
