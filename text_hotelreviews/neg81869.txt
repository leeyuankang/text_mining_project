the room was tiny and gloomy and bore no resemblance to the website there was a construction site at the end of the street not mentioned on the website and we were kept awake by trucks in the early hours of the morning we d booked for two nights but left after one having had such a poor night s sleep this was a business trip and i couldn t afford another sleepless night the hotel manager was unsympathetic and rude insisting that i pay for the second night even though we didn t stay and had to find and pay for another room for the night
