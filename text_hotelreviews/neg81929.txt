doesn t deserve a star rating the staff were very unfriendly and not welcoming at all the restaurant floor was badly stained and breakfast service was appalling too impersonal like going into a canteen the front of house and hospitality was non existent the bedrooms were very dark and gloomy the shower head kept falling down so you couldn t have a shower one of the toilets didn t flush no complimentary water in rooms the restaurant was closed for dinner wifi connection was weak
