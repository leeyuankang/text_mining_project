the location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area there is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel or maybe there s a secret passage that i missed who knows in any case after walking minutes i felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro
