while the hotel was lovely for the most part we found the restaurant lacking in service and cleanliness things seemed very disorganized while we were there with dirty dishes left on tables and messes left at the buffet it was difficult getting the attention of anyone if we needed something so we just did it ourselves believe it or not we could not connect our adaptor in the bathroom so i could use my hot curling brush for my hair they only had something for men s razors which seemed very odd to me i ended up sitting on the floor near the bed doing my hair in front of a tiny mirror as all the outlets that took adaptors were on walls away from mirrors
