room was t really clean when i arrived i had leftover tea and coffe sachets with no setup for a new guest arriving called the reception they asked me to come down to change the room this is might be ok in france to ask a guest to come down to change his room when you checked him in a dirty room where i come from and when you have such unfortunate issue where hotel does a mistake at least a manager calls to aplogize and send a team member to change the room i am a big fan of pullman as a brand and this is my stay at pullman montparnasse and maybe stay in pullman brand in general worldwide was a letdown this time
