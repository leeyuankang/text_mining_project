i think i can write a big essay here service does not match with its name brand i dont usually use hard words but service everywhere in the hotel was pathetic reception told us that we get bottles of water per person per day but the guy at room service would only give bottles plain and sparkling it s kind of compulsory to take sparkling so you cannot get two normal water and he made a big fuss out of it either you take this or i am going breakfast was another struggle i ordered omelette which took mins and then came a wrong one then i requested to get hot water for tea as we had to wait a long time for the omelette then came the right omelette but mins to bring hot water so omelette got cold and they were not even apologetic staff behavior was such that at times it was close to being rude room service was ultra slow they forget things to bring with breakfast and then would take long time to bring which spoils your mood for breakfast meal the cleaning people would call times for room make up even when you tell them that we will let the reception know and even after informing they entered our room for cleaning while we were there i have a long list and can go on mainly related to service it is a big hotel and you as one customer do not mean much to them i guess as i said only because of nima we managed to have good time at the hotel
