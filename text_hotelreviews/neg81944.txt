we had issues with noise from the rooms either side of us we had an adjoining door on either side of the room with no insonirisation we could hear everything that was being said including a crying baby which woke us during the night and children playing all afternoon so no catch up with a snooze in the afternoon and we couldn t complain to the neighbours as babies cry and children play that s normal we wrote to the management about this they answered more or less satisfactorily the hotel was very full due to a handball competition we were there to relax it wasn t relaxing but we ve stayed in this hotel many times with no issues so all in all we won t change we ll definitely refuse a room with adjoining doors though next time
