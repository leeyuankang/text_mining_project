reervations were messed up when we arrived full payment paid at time of booking but charged an additional in dispute currently we reserved two rooms for two nights each when we arrived we were told we only reserve one room the first night if i had not had my reservation paperwork we were going to be charged again ultimately it was discovered they misspelled our name on the second reservation but we had to prove everthing we were wrong and the front desk office were right sad part is we spoke french realatively well and this was a return visit to this hotel because of the past service disappointed at the lack of accountability and reservation accuracy
