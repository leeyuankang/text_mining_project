the room was not very clean with stains on the carpet and down the fridge door the tv did not work as a result of which we shared out first evening with a technician in the room for over one hour attempting repairs one of the drawers in the room would only close if manipulated probably the main issue was that the room we were in had a connecting door to the room next to it and as a result we could hear the conversations of the people next door and their television which they left on one night until am the next morning one of the reasons for selecting this hotel was that we had stayed their the previous year and found it very good this time we considered it to have deteriorated and represented poor value for what is quite an expensive hotel we will not be staying their again
