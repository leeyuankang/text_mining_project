the location is very poor there are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel no taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood there are prostitutes in same area saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on the view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc no eifel tower views from my window
