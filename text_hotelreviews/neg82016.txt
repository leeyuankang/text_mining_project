the information staff were very rude and of little help to make a cup of tea there was no tea bags in the room and when asked i was given tea bags plus paper cups to drink out of for a high class hotel they really need to lift their game i definitely would not recommend this accommodation to anyone i was surprised that avalon cruises used this accommodation as they always have first class accommodation
