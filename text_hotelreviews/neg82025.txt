literally the only slightly annoying thing was that they had advertised a sunday kids brunch but we were told when we arrived that wasn t on during august due to staff holidays so we didn t get to try that might have been nice to know in advance especially as we had booked with kids a bit so we could enjoy a lazy sunday brunch them in the hotel
