the old bath room used to be cleaner but with the new bath room there are too much dirt around which i had never seen before at the old batch room i think the dark tiles are causing the cleaner to clean properly all the corner of the batch if pullman does not start cleaning properly the bath room and remove all those dirt in the corner it won t be long before the whole new bath room is completely unacceptable and will turn this hotel rate to or stars my recommendation will be to have white tiles as before so that the cleaner could see clearly and clean properly or if pullman wants to keep the current dark tiles then instructions must be given to all cleaners to clean properly the bath room especially all corner where the bath and tiles meet furthermore pullman must have clean bath curtain in the bath to prevent water watering all over the floor and the sink desk something we do not see with the old style bath room whoever design this new bath room made mistake but it can be managed if my advices are taken into consideration or else my wife and i will never sleep there again i have using this hotel since from the time of meridian to pullman but this is the first time i had to complain
