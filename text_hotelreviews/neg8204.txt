as you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of paris it is not far to get into town once you reach porte de la chapelle metro station but it is a decent minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed let s just say i wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless i am in a group of guys there are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around porte de la chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there gym needs to have some weights and a bench aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups i suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay
