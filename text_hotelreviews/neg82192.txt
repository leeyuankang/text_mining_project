we had initially booked a classic bedroom but only to find out when we arrived that the room was very very small for even people too pricey for classic bedrooom we had to pay extra to upgrade for a superior room of a decent size if i had known the size of the classic bedroom i wouldn t have booked it at all the photos of the classic bedroom you find here is not realistic i was really disappointed the other issue was the hotel is undergoing renovation and we weren t informed about this there is no breakfast room available our total price for the nights stay was euros which is too pricey for this hotel
