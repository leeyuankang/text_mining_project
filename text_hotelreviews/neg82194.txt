there was no hotel frontage dust and building work going on no restaurant all are being refurbished rooms were not visited by housekeeping or tea replenished etc i guess with all the disruption and booked breakfast is now in a bag fine with all this if i had known beforehand and it was cheaper i am sure the hotel will look fabulous when finished just not a nice experience for us a real shame
