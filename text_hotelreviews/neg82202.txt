the hotel was under construction and we were not made aware of that at the time of booking or prior to arrival the breakfast was included in the price but the breakfast area was under construction so the staff brought coffee tea oj and two croissants to the room in a bag the room is small which is normal for european hotels but that meant we ate our breakfast on the bed
