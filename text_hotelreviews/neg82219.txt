there was no wifi connection for the entire duration only in the lobby when i asked about this i was told this was due to the rennovation taking place outside since i was there on business this was highly inconvenient when i checked in no mention was made of the wifi problem it was only after i complained did they admit to the problem breakfast could be a lot nicer small dark room in the cellar coffee from a machine and poor quality croissants
