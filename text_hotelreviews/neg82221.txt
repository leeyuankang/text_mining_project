the hotel was covered with scaffold the air conditioning didn t work and it was impossible to open windows because of the work dust on the scaffold i refused to stay in the little first bedroom that they proposed me which was on the back side of the hotel it was all dark with black protective covers and no air con un trou rats they nicely proposed me an another room with more light on the street side but still far from confortable as it was mentioned on your booking site i would have like to be aware of the renovating work of the hotel so i would have not stay there as a french i believe it doesn t give a good image of french hotels for foreigners and i don t think it is what we need all at the moment i have been using booking hotel website for years but i don t know if i will use it in the future because booking agencies should be aware of everything about the hotels they sell
