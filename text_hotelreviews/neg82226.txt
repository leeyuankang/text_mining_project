there was refurhbishment work going on air con not working the first room we were offered was an airless oven the staff moved us to another room which was ok but still no air con there were workmen on the scaffolding outside so not much privacy noisy plaster dust outside the room although the room itself was clean a bit of a disappointment but we were only there for two nights so we decided to put up with it breakfast disappointing although all the staff were very friendly
