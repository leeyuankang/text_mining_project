the room was super small to get to the other side of the bed you had to go over the bed there is ongoing renovation should be from am but at am a guy was standing in front of our window we had to leave the window open all the time to get at least some colder air as in room it was degrees c and airconditioning was not working we were all the time in the city so no reason for us to complain but if you want to get a little relaxation at your room then this is wrong place
