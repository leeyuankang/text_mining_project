the hotel is under renovation and it is absolutelly wrong than they don t tell you that before you get there rooms are really hot and they don t have ac nor elevator and it is impossible to open the windows because again is under renovation so you don t get fresh air or sun light it s by far the worse hotel i ve been my whole life
