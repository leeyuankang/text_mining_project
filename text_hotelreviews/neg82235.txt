when my wife and i arrived the receptionist said the hotel was under renovation so no air conditioning no phone and worst of all no lift we had to walk flights of stairs to our room everyday it would be nice if we could be told the hotel is under renovation before we arrive but we were not informed on the day we left they promised that they will find a porter to help carry our luggage down the stairs but they ended up failing to get a porter to come in in addition we told two of the staff that we needed them to call a taxi for us to go to the train station on the day we checked out but they ended up finding us a hotel transport when the driver was told to take us to airport luckily the hotel transport person was nice and took us to the train station where we were meant to go to otherwise we would end up being at airport
