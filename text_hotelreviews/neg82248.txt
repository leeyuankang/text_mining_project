the room size is around sq metres the size of my bathroom a very uncomfortable bed impossible to open properly the cabinet as the room just doesn t fit any furniture if you open the door to the bathroom it feels like a prison cell the clean lady didn t bother to fill the empty bottles of shower gels and shampoo there is no temperature control in the room only the central heating which was acting up all the time or it impossible hot so i had to open the windows or it freezing the reception was useless it couldn t be a star hotel
