the hotel is really small not the room itself but everything else the frontdesk the lift etc the hairdryer in the bathroom looks like a vaccum the personnel give you the minimum information the girls at the front desk smiles to you and everything but it look fake i come back to the hotel one night at and the front door was locked no body at the front desk and no phone or place to put my room key in order to open the door i waited outside looking for something to open the door or call someone finally someone came up after min and opened me the door
