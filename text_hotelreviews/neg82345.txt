the electric kettle wasnt functioning too well keeps on boiling despite it reaches the boiling point n i had asked the reception in the morning to replace one for me when i returned to the room in the evening the kettle had been taken away but no replacement was made followed up with the reception n they told me that no replacement is available actually this surprised me a bit i therefore requested them to bring back the original one so that i can continue to have hot water in the room n they said they will try to find it but at the end they didnt bring it back to me nor revert to me even if they couldnt find it
