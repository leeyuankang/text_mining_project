basically we have to acknowledge it s paris and near champs elys es expesinve limited in space and public parking available only we did not expet more from hotel but paris as a trouristic destination should offer at least cheap tickets for public transportation and special rates for parking nearby the hotel furthermore i expected the french chefs would have a bit more pride the food in the majority of the restaurants are below expected standards without passion however france is great and paris a must of course e g museum sight seeing there are also some good restaurants if you are willing not to worry too much about the budget the only item i would critisize about the hotel is breakfast available only in the hotel room and certainly with an additional charge probably i would offer free coffee and croissants in the lobby if i would be the owner of that place
