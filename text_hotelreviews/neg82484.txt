a huge mismatch between the pictures on the website and the room we were given room no the hotel should inform customers when they have half the hotel renovated and the remaining half is very old they should charge the rooms accordingly i wouldn t rate this hotel as a no heating within the building separate heater and cooler within the room naturally the room was quite chilly when we arrived around very bad wifi connection the hotel needs urgent renovation
