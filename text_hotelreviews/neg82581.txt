the gore has a great potential the locations is steps away from hyde park royal albert hall and the museums unfortunately at the time of my visit the facade was under renovations with scaffold all the way covering the windows without letting me know there was either no privacy or i had to keep the windows closed and covered the pluming needs work the shower had either cold or hot water but not the mixed one it made is impossible to use it the sink did not drain properly small things but makes the difference the biggest problem came at dinner time they not only hurry us up we dine at after the prom concerts and they knew it but i was also overcharged and had to dispute the bill the next day quality of food was good but too bad if you finish the dinner like this the room was good nice size good quality but on the top floor and access was difficult no elevator however the staff was friendly and made the luggage trip easier i wish i did not get disappointed by the dinner bill and by the fact that somehow a hotel should inform upfront its clients if construction works are being done during the booking
