the first room we were given was very badly layed out having had a busy day we wanted to spend a quiet evening in our room and watch the tv however due to the tv being positioned in a recess we could not see the full screen plus the view was further obstructed by one of the bed posts in fact the only place one could actually view the full screen of the tv was by sitting on the desk which was clearly not acceptable after speaking to reception we were offered an alternative room which was better however the bed was so high my wife had to use a chair to get in it i am almost foot tall and i even found it a struggle to get into bed there was also a dreadfully disturbing repeated sound of running water which appeared to be coming from pipes or drains within wall cavities i contacted the duty manager at and she came to the room and agreed the noise was dreadful the overall experience was certainly not what i would have expected considering the room rate i was paying on checkout we were given a discount off our bill but as our stay was intended to be a treat for my wife s birthday the experience fell well short of our expectations
