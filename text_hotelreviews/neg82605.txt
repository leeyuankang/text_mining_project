breakfast staff no side plates for toast had to ask for side plates and toast and then they only brought one side plate out so me and hubby shared and no separate knives so had to use the knives for the cooked breakfast also had to ask for butter separate members of staff kept coming up and asking us the same questions so maybe needs a bit of refinement there but it wasn t anything that made the experience awful
