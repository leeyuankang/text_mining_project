i found small lumps of black plastic rubber in the water after we had already had tea and hot chocolate where we would have drunk some of these without noticing i was upset that this might not be good for us and i was unhappy with the lack of getting back to me about what it was and whether it would be sorted out also the window didn t close properly and there was scaffolding outside our second floor window with ladders below which meant the view was obscured but also anyone could potentially have climbed up the ladder to just outside our window
