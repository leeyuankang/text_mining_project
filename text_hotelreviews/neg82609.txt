there was renovation going on we had lots of discomfort the room on st floor it was not possible to open the balcony door due to the scaffolding also the balcony door was too old and wind was blowing through the room was unbelievably small the second one on th floor had even worse problems as there were construction remains and wood shavings on the carpet in front of their door
