breakfast was a bit of a disappointment especially as we paid extra for breakfast to be included on booking but in actual fact to have a hot dish we still had to pay extra we did of course thinking that it would be an excellent full english but i have had much better in builder s cafes we were expecting better seeing as the place has a luxury vibe they need to buy higher quality foods simple
