i didn t like the fact that i booked this room back in december and stated clearly that it was for adults and a young child i was told day before we travelled that there were no rooms left with a double and single bed and that a childs cot would not fit in the room we were then told we could stay at their sister hotel but would have to pay a further to have a bed for my child in that room could this not have been said to us when we made the booking so we could organise something or cancel the reservation why wait till the day before we travel to tell us not sure who the fault lies with whether it s the hotel or booking com but it wasn t good enough and we won t be using either again
