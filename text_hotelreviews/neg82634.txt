our room was very small and the bathroom obviously very close to the bedroom hence very little privacy the bathroom did not have any extraction fan so the steam filled the room very quickly to the point of the walls dripping the shower was ornate but literally flooded the bathroom as there was nothing to trap the spraying shower water we had to use the bathrobes on the floor to soak up the water
