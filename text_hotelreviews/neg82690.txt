the first room we were in there was an issue with the shower the water would not get hot we let the desk know on the first day they had maintenance look at it there was no change the second day we said something to the desk and they upgraded us to a different room the only other issue was that the cleaning woman was very gruff and aggressive towards us because we put the please service room sign up but hadn t left yet
