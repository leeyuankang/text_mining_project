a couple of bizarre things given the cost ot the room there was no tea and coffee provided in the room when we asked it seemed like they just didn t want to provide any you get tea and coffee in a travelodge room so can t understand why they don t do it many other reviews said the same thing as i found out later it took us a day to get an extra bed side lamp in our room again very bizzare the room was very nice but the carpet looked quite stained again odd for such an otherwise up market hotel
