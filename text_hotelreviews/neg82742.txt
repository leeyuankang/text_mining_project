creaky bed small room prices just on the wrong side of good value even though i paid close to the bottom price of i didn t feel ripped off though for a coffee really double charged for breakfast probably a mistake but it s better when you don t have to point it out if they were cheaper they would be my first choice go to hotel in london however at night there are lots to choose from if i had one suggestion it would be to get some decent leather chesterfield type chairs and tables in the guest lounge i ve never seen anyone in it and i think it s because the furniture may be period but it s uncomfortable and badly arranged
