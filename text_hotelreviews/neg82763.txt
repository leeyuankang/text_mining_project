location was too far from knightsbridge it takes minutes to walk there and over minutes if you have shopping the russian waitresses were not friendly and the receptionists spoke little to no english they not only made a mistake on my breakfast order because they couldn t understand english they were also very rude to asian people the toilet on the ground floor stank worse than a public toilet it smelt like urine had been on the floor for days the hotel room cleaner was stingy on soap and toiletries they did not give us shampoo soap or sanitary bags for the three days we stayed there
