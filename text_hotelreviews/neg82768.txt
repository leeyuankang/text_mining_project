heating in room set to high so was very warm we used the bar after the show at the albert hall but had to sit at the bar the waitress said she would get us a table as soon as one was free but forgot the waitress at breakfast brought us half toasted toast and we had to ask for clean knives and more plates and returned with fork knife and spoon
