not enough staff in the bar after performance many people had long waits i am sure the hotel lost money too we ensured we paid but it would have been easy not to have done i also think service on an already expensive bottle of bubbly is a little cheeky especially when service slow the same applied to our tea coffee after performance when service was shocking staff were lovely just not enough of them
