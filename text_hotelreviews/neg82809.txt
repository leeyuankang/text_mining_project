had absolute murders with this hotel as we had booked this for mum for her birthday and a day before she was to stay they wanted to see photo i d and the credit card that the booking was paid with by the way we actually paid it all months before the stay and said unless we produced it mum would not be allowed to stay so we actually had to pay them again only for them to refund back the payment to us after the stay does this make any sense no it doesn t will not be staying here again by the way don t expect tea or coffee in room they don t do it only if you want to pay a kings ransome for room service
