the wash hand basin in our bathroom had a great big crack nothing was done even when i mentioned it to reception the bedroom and bathroom were very small had to squeeze around the bottom of the bed to get into it and hardly any room in the bathroom to sit on the toilet squashed in between the toilet roll holder and the wash had basin if you were a large person it would have been a problem overall for the amount of money it cost to stay for two nights i was very disappointed and would never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone
