felt for the quality of the hotel the bed was not comfortable both the bed and the half bed moved in for the person were uncomfortable wish there was an option at breakfast in the restaurant for a smaller choice croissant toast cereal etc and not just the buffet or main course felt the buffet was not worth the price don t mind paying for something that is worth it
