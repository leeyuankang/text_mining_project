the noise from the air conditioning vent in my room was so bad i was unable to sleep until it sounded like a car revving and when i complained twice in the middle of the night i was told that there was nothing they could do as it was the kitchen fans they did reduce my bill by half but the stress put a damper on the whole trip the restaurant is also overpriced with limited choice and the service charge is outrageous
