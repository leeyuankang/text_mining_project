the staff were friendly but didn t try to do that extra which you d expect from the price range we had to call for more toiletries even toilet paper times as the cleaners didn t leave or notice that we needed new refill it felt like the staff were lazy because we were two young friends staying in a room i wasn t really impressed by this hotel i was very excited to stay there but i wouldn t recommend it to friends
