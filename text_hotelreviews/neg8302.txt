in relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the floor so i could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof as they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so i was happy that they moved us
