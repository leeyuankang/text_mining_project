the rooms are tiny best suited for a solo guest even for a couple with suit cases the rooms are like dorms and extremely tight to move around in the lighting is also quite dim with the windows being so deep and that makes it a challenge for getting ready doing makeup seeing outside i would stay again just in a larger room
