the bathroom floor floods somewhat as there is no shower door or lip on the floor although it is nice to see such a popular bar reception area a lot of people were taking a lot of room up on seating areas with laptop paraphernalia to the detriment of hotel guests unable to find a seat close to the bar to have a drink i do feel there needs to be a no laptop use area
