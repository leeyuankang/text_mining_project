the room was tiny for the price the room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed the window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what i d imagine a prison to have i was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room great staff but just wouldn t stay again as i wasn t comfortable in the room
