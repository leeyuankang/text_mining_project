room isn t that spacious compared to the room i previously stayed in at the hoxton at shoreditch and it was more expensive we had a late midweek meal at the hubbard and bell restaurant it wasn t that busy but staff left us waiting for ages to pay our bill we asked two different members of staff for it and could see them all standing around at the front eventually we had to get up and go to the front to pay on our way out
