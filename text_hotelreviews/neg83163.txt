rooms were nicely decorated but absolutely tiny and the service was terrible the staff in restaurant and bar were incredibly unfriendly couldn t be bothered at all the seats in the bar were all very low to the ground which meant i couldn t sit down i have a bad back a few higher hardback chairs would have been welcome while the free light in room breakfast was a nice idea the content of it wasn t really thought through yoghurt and juice should be kept refrigerated but the fridge was too small to fit them in meaning you have to eat them as soon as you wake up a pastry would be more suitable
