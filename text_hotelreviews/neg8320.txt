the bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat i had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good
