the room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel we were told we were given an upgrade i cannot imagine what we were supposed to have also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose the bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up the demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again there was very little thought put into these issues on the whole i feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn
