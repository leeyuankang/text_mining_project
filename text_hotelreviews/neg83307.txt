we had no breakfast bag in the room ready to complete for the morning so we notified reception who took down our request unfortunately our order was overlooked and we had no bag in the morning slightly disappointing good job we d taken some croissants the lobby was just full of people looking like techno zombies on their phones and laptops using the excellent free wifi which meant it was difficult to get a seat other than that no complaints
