the room was the smallest room i had ever seen it was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos the was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on it was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed
