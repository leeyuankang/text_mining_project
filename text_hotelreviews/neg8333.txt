the rooms were tiny this was a deal breaker i do not recall seeing sizes when i booked but i acknowledge they may have been listed at that time i know they are listed now because i looked it up if we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical from what i can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms the single induced claustrophobia we usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc that was impossible in this hotel
