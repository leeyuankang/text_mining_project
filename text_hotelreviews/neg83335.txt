i was charged on top of what i paid for my stay and when i asked the purpose of this extra charge staff replied so if you buy anything from us we can deduct it from this pre pay amount as it happened i only spent pounds out of that and didn t get the rest back this was not mentioned in your policy when i booked the hotel hidden charges are never a wise way of attracting customers i conduct business daily and i know the impacts of such behaviours
