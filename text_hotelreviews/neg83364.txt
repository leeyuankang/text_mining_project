we asked for an iron but were told that other guests are keeping it and hence they would not be able to lend it to us for a star hotel i should hope that it has more than one set of iron as a result we had to attend an event with wrinkled shirts and suits the reception area is always noisy and crowded with customers for the bar coffee shop the room is also much smaller than it looks in the photo
