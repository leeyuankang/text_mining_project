i had booked the room for a special occasion to celebrate my husband s birthday and i made a specific request at the time of booking for a bottle of prosecco to be in the room on arrival i phoned ahead of our arrival to check that the hotel had details of this and they confirmed that they did but this was not in the room when we arrived it was obvious it had been forgotten and we had to ask for it to be put in the room when we checked out we were still charged for the bottle being brought to our room when it should have already been in there also after we came back to the room from a night out a balloon was in the room saying happy birthday although this was a nice touch again it would have been better if this had been in the room when we arrived we were not even early checking in so there was no excuse why these finer touches had not been attended to
