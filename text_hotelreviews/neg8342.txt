our room it was the smallest room i have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose i booked a superior double room it was not a double and definitely not superior i had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom i have stayed in many hotels including in paris and this is the smallest by far when we arrived at the hotel approx there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience for the price we paid it was not value for money
