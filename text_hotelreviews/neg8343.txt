the room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking the actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at in view of all this we felt it was very overpriced
