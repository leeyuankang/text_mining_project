the room was on the floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night the room was the tiniest room that i have ever stayed in and i travel a lot to london and abroad the regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre i literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom the room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy the photographs within the booking details are misleading
