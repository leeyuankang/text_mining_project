tv was terrible remote didn t work properly i had problems with the internet when phoned down to the night staff he said i had to wait till the technical team were available in the morning when i spoke to daytime staff they explained the problem and it was a quick fix probably should have been informed when checking in parking was an issue i informed them prior to arrival i will need a parking space when i arrived there was no parking spaces so i had to park out the from of the hotel i done all that was asked of me to get a ticket through phone which cost over to find i still got a parking ticket this all would have been avoided if they accepted my request prior to booking in the elevator there is a sign for hour food service when i phoned down for this service around the guy on the desk said no its not available was very rude about it as well
