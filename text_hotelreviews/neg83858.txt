having seen other reviews it seems that issues i can across do not seem to be actioned such a toilet roll holder in a very awkward place in the small double handle on window so loose it may of come off which meant i could not lock it securely this meant due to being on the side of extractor fans it was rather noisy so even paying over for a room where you cannot sleep is rather counter productive two pairs of ear plugs provided but i cannot sleep with them in and fo not expect to wear them i should not have to the doors are heavy and heard people in and out of room all night and could hear the lift go ping all night it would be a great hotel if these things for comfort reasons were addressed as other mecures have a higher comfort level and you can sleep soundly
