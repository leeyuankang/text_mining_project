the lift was small anyway and could hold no more than people however of the cleaning staff jumped in it with me which made me worry then the lift broke considering i have recently had knee surgery no lift and the floor did not mix well we couldn t get into our room when we arrived despite having the keys redone the maid had to let us in when we did get in we found the toilet didn t flush the lady at reception did move out room which was better if you re staying at the weekend don t book to park at the hotel it s not actually at the hotel and it s cheaper to park on the street as sundays most of saturday is free
