we stayed in a small double room and paid for nights the bedroom was ridiculously small and was not fit for people my husband had to lie on the bed while i got ready and vice versa as there was not enough space for people to stand anywhere in the bedroom or bathroom at the same time most uncomfortable stay in a hotel i have experienced breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice however both mornings we had to ask for bowls as they d run out and the bacon was non existent on the morning there were hardly any tables for people so we had to sit separately from our friends all in all after this experience i would not stay in the mecure kensington again
