we sent a email regarding our room to be in a quiet location in the hotel away from lifts ect before we arrived as we had to travel from abroad when we got to our room it was opposite the lift we paid for a upgrade on our room and the extras were not in our room when we arrived also there must have been a school party at the hotel and they were on our floor and in the next room to us so they were very loud banging on doors screaming shouting ect so we complained and was able to move eventually to a different part of the hotel and we got the extras that we paid for in our room plus the manager gave us a bowl of fruit two little bottles of wine and chocolate also we had a bit of a refund as we were staying three nights plus the pictures on the internet look lovely of the hotel but a bit deceiving as the rooms and hotel are a lot smaller than what they look on the internet
