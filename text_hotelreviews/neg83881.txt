there were several rooms of disruptive guests school children on my floor each day sometimes multiple times i had to call the front desk to report door slamming running back and forth in the hall loud noise this happened on sat night until pm and began sunday morning at am the hotel staff person on sunday night said i have asked the children to be quiet but they haven t done it so there is nothing we can do i could not believe this finally i asked her to meet me on my floor in the hallway and we were going to have a conversation with the children and their teacher adult accompanying them and get this resolved so we did just that the teacher was very attentive and he did stop the noise i just wonder why the hotel staff did not take such initiative on friday saturday and sunday so frustrating and disruptive i mentioned that i was certain there was a hotel policy on unnecessary noise and disruption but she didn t respond only saying that they had asked them to be quiet and they hadn t done it so they could do nothing this saturday night staff person said she would have the manager contact me i have received no word from the manager i also told this staff person that i would have to go on social media and state what happened as i wouldn t want this to happen to anyone else and she said go ahead i don t care i think this might be the bottom line she didn t care nor did the hotel
