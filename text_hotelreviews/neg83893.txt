the room had a bad smell like the carpet was wet and did not dry properly and the room could not be changed as hotel was fully booked i order an extra large bed which i expected to come in a bigger room breakfast was not enjoyable eggs were bitty pancakes were hard and tasted doughy the only good thing i had on that menu was the green tea and orange juice the fact that my partner had to witness a person throw up at the bar area was unacceptable no free parking and the cost off the parking on the street was ridiculous right now i am currently looking for a hotel for this weekend coming as well and if i was happy mercure could have had my business
