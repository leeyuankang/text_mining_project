the room was tiny you have to turn sideways against the wall to get round to the other side of the bed acceptable for a one night stay but no longer there s no space for a suitcase the switch on my bedside lamp was broken so could only operate it by plugging unplugging it the bar didn t have the wine that we wanted on the wine list and the draft lager was awful smelled really bad serving us drinks at seemed to be a bit of an inconvenience for the staff member who told us that it wasn t her job as she was the receptionist it was adequate but i wouldn t stay here again
