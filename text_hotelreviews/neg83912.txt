air conditioning was not working and room was at night windows sealed and so uncomfortable so sleep was very disturbed hotel staff were aware within hours of arrival and it was never addressed even though i complained times in total i have a dispute with their invoice for that reason as i do not feel their services were accurately described in their remit i cannot sleep in a temp of with no air and suspect many others are the same they did advise they would move us to another room but thought a fan would suffice unfortunately blowing hot air noisily overnight was not an acceptable resolution no one responded at front desk on our final night to arrange a change of rooms the manager although we did not speak with her did offer off the final night this was not accepted as every night was affected
