i had to ask to change room because the room i was given was small dirty dusty tatty and the bathroom smelled i was given a small double even though i booked a standard double skirting board was chipped and flaking duvet cover was very old the bed was tiny and there was a stain on the throw and visible dust that had clearly been gathering for some time the room was also cold the room i changed to was cleaner with better quality bed lined and of an expected size slightly better standard but not great for a hotel in kensington paying over for one night
