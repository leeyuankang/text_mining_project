no hot water or wifi for one of the two nights we were there there is no where to park the hotel only has two parking spaces this information was not in booking com we spent lots of time moving the car as you can only park on the street you pay for four hours at a time if we had known we could have pre booked a parking spot we booked this hotel six months out so i am sure one was available when we made the booking
