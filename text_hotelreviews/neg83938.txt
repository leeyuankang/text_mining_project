the bar was not open when we returned on saturday hoping for a snack and a hot drink they could only do black coffee in the machine and a few available cakes days prior to staying the hotel took the first night payment off my credit card we were not advised of this at check in they then charged for the full stay on checkout i did not realise this until i checked my statement once home i phoned the hotel and was told that the first night would be refunded after working days i do not feel that this is acceptable practice
