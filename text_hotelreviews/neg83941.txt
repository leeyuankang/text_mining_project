we were changed on check in from the mercure kensington to mercure paddington without prior notice by email or phone even though we had an executive room it was very small we were joking on how cramped it was the train noise from the paddington station was mildly annoying the last thing was that my wife asked for a hairdryer as the built in one didn t work and had to wait more than an hour with wet hair to have it delivered all that the reception staff was able to say was we re sorry not good enough if i m paying a hefty rate to have good time in london
