first of all during my days stay times a keycard did not work and i needed to go down to reprogram it also for me the pictures in the internet looked much nicer than actually the hotel was i have stayed in many of the star hotels in london and that was so far the worst of it the room was so tight that i couldnt even lay all my bags on the floor nor move freely beside the bed and the wall this is not a star but more star hotel and i expected way more from well known hotel chain i also cant understand that if there is a tv in the room why it isnt on the wall so you can watch it straight from the bed but the tv is on a table what is on the left near the up side of bed so the only option to watch the tv is to stand aside the bed but you cant watch it while being in bed also the wind blew in from window and i couldnt close it correctly and the air heater either gave too much heat or no heat at all i assume the tunable swich did not work correctly also the bathroom was so tiny that you cant sit in a tolilet and use the facility correctly i had great expectations on that hotel an took a lot of time of booking but to be honest the room was rather disappointing
