our room was very small we had a standard double room which had about on one side of the double bed and only enough room at the foot of the bed to shuffle sideways around the small desk table against the wall had the tea tray and other items so not really any space to put anything down we considered asking about the possibility of an upgrade to a larger room but decided we could cope for the nights we were there we didn t spend much time in the room as we had planned a busy trip and the one evening we returned early we enjoyed some time in the bar lounge area so the room was adequate for our needs do check the hotel website if you are concerned about room size as there is very detailed information available before booking our main concern was the size of the bed as we re used to a big bed despite being smaller than we re used to the bed was very comfortable with the most comfortable pillows a real bonus in a small room was to have a bath shower in a very decent sized bathroom if the size of the room matters to you then certainly consider the information but please don t be put off as this is a great hotel
