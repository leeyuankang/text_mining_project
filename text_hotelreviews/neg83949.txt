check in was quick check out took a while they were busy with a group and only had one person on reception polite about the wait though space was smaller than most four star hotels night times were cold because the windows aren t double glazed and hot air con stops working in the night did not enquire about changing room because i only had one night left location is good but not great it s next to the bupa cromwell hospital a bit dreary and not generally a good vibe gloucester rd tube is about minute walk away sainsbury s is very close and a few good restaurants hit miss with the quality of service
