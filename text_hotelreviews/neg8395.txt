the first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small we relocated to room which was the same size as the first ie very small we hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost room did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after i mentioned it also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall i guess it did work
