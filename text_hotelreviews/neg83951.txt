i booked this hotel as it said it came with parking to be doubly sure i would get parking i made it a special request when i booked upon arrival in the hotel i was informed the hotel only had two spaces neither of which was available the receptionist informed us we could park on the street outside she didn t tell us that in order to do this we had to have a sack load of coins as the machine only accepted coins and at an hour this was well nigh impossible and very inconvenient especially as we had to get up earlier than intended the next morning to feed the meter i would most certainly not have booked this hotel if i knew about the parking situation and feel aggrieved that parking was advertised as a selling point when it wasn t available
