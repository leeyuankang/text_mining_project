worst hotel i have ever stayed in my entire life it has the standard of a low class hostel rooms are tiny there is no even space where to put the suitcase the walls are dirty the floor old and uncleared it s really cold all the time and no insonorisation so there is no privacy whatsoever if you want to stay in your room during the day it s even worst cause you can hear the housekeepers talking and the doors being slapped so if you want to relax or work on your laptop forget about it the tv is on the side of the bed so i don t understand how you wan use you don t been have space to use the chair they have put so you can face the tv so what was the point of putting tv anyway the worst is that they ask you a prepaid pounds and when you get into the room there is no minibar when i asked for what reason they said it is in the case i damage the room but the room is already damaged and in a terrible state the sink in the bathroom get stuck whenever you wash your hands there are plenty of hotels nearby and even ibis is far better so avoid as you can especially for the price you are paying
