definitely not star four single beds in a family room hardly big enough to swing a cat i was upgraded to this room and travelled solo still not much room for luggage i couldn t imagine a family staying here the mattresses on the single beds were the most uncomfortable i ve ever slept or sat on way too soft still i only stayed one night and checked out the next day to a more comfortable hotel
