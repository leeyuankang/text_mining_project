for starters the lift was too small for me to enter with my luggage which was nothing but a small hand carry and shoulder bag the floor rooms are quite tight and all doors are quite close to each other at times i could not make out if the door that just got shut was the next door neighbor one s or did somebody just balk into my room the room at best was very basic barely enough room to move around only a one side tabled bed and bare minimum lighting which i think is normal for london hotels however there were other things which made my life miserable starting from tv and its remote which weren t operational to attending calls i asked the staff to send some one across to my room for checking why tv wasn t working the guy who came by could not speak proper english resulting in difficulty during communication following which we found out that the remote was in operational and had to be changed it was the first time in my life that a hotel did not activate my wake up alarm despite calling them to inform about it in advance the wake up call came after minutes of the set time another first for me was that the room service personnel did not bother picking up used towels from my room after getting the room cleaned up unfortunately the air conditioning stayed very low to keep me sweating at many times upon checking the temperature it was set at degree with maximum cooling but i was mostly uncomfortable throughout the night
