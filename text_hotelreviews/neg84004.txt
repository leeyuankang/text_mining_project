our room itself although quite small despite paying extra for a spacious privilege room was nice it was however badly let down by the bathroom the worst of the problems were a shower that wouldn t stay in position i had to fix it with a business card and a supposedly clean towel that was put in our room with stains and what appeared to be chewing gum stuck to it with these major flaws in mind you start to notice smaller things that maybe wouldn t bother you otherwise the bathroom looked a bit rundown in general with spotlights loose in the roof and the taps for the shower broken away from the wall at one side though still functional given that the rest of the hotel was nice i m a bit puzzled that mercure are satisfied with poor quality bathrooms in a hotel they class as star noise inside the hotel was also an issue room doors would slam shut hard and people moving around in the hallway could be clearly heard in the room
