we took one small double room and that is really a small room i believe these small double rooms should not be allowed and do not fit a hotel because at the end is just a single room with the smallest possible double bed in the market also to walk from one side of the room to the other i had to lean on the bed because the clearance was only cms from the bed to the wall of course we called booking com and they solved the problem and upgraded us to a proper double room
