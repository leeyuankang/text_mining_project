i had the first trouble to check in because the hotel misspelled my name in their reservation system the receptionist could not find my booking even though i gave the booking number i had to wait for long time the second trouble occurred at the breakfast breakfast was included in my room rate however the room number and my name were not shown in the list i was asked to go to the reception and solve the problem by myself it would be better if one of breakfast staff handled it also the hotel address is pretty tricky it would be helpful if they say cromwell road instead of lexham gardens
