didn t like the coffee at breakfast it was too strong also didn t like the fact that in spite of paying for breakfast as part of the room booking with booking com we were told or times at breakfast by several different staff that we hadn t paid for breakfast and then after showing them the booking details and confirmation on my phone and still not being believed we had to leave the breakfast room to go and speak to the lady at reception kind of spoilt what would have been a very nice breakfast
