this hotel is by far the worst accor experience we have ever had it is certainly not up to any standard suggested by the mercure category first and foremost we checked in with a booking for a standard double room not the small room and were introduced to a tiny cramped space where one can barely move to the other side of the bed nothing close to the advertised square metres neither close in comfort to what is shown on the hotel photos upon complaining at the reception we were informed by the clerk that it was normal that all hotels cheat on their websites and only as a special treatment we would be granted an upgrade to a bigger room the bigger room was closer in size to what had been advertised which does not help the fact it felt very worn out extremely noisy we literally heard every single sound from the hall or the adjacent rooms and the bathroom was cramped and seriously lacking in cleanliness the room service kept bothering us from in the morning once even entering the room abrubtly after seconds from knocking the breakfast was o k although at minutes prior to its end the food wasn t replenished anymore which we believe is a breach of some most basic guest service rules we kept wondering how it was possible that mercure inspectors visit this hotel and still allow it to operate under the brand
