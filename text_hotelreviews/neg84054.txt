booked a small double room which was adequate but was quite small approx foot space between end of the bed and the wall in saying that room was equipped with all you would need tv tea coffee hairdryer iron ironing board ensuite hotel seemed to only have small lift for guests so certainly in the morning time there can be a wait for it
