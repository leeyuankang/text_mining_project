the room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room it was smaller than our bedroom at home the view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade i couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room the pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown the advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune i ve spent over less per night in london for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities the overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost
