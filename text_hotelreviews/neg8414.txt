the hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when i was checking in what s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident i had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service the hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us after the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred we had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway they were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time as guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless
