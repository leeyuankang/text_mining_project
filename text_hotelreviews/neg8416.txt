we booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available at the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything we booked a club room with club lounge access from booking com however we found out that the club lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility at least one of the days the lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests
