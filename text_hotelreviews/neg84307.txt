despite having stayed here many times we are never welcomed as returning guests and good clients with some exceptions the staff at the front are cold and rather officious as opposed to household and restaurant staff who are very welcoming and helpful it s a pity my other pet peeves for me pillows are too soft and i detest rain showers
