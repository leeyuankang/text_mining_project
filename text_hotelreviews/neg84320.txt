i was so disappointed with my evening meal i never complain but the steak was so tough i couldn t eat it if a waiter had come and asked before my knife and fork where placed together i would have sent it back however they offered me a free drink to compensate was it enough i didn t return the second night because of this and ate else where this was the only thing that let my stay down
