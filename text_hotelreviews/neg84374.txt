when we arrived at the property at check in time after travelling for hours to get there we were told our room wasn t ready and they would ring us when it was available so we went for a drink in the pub opposite the hotel and waited in there for hours until we went back over to the hotel and i asked how long would our room be and the receptionist told us it was ready so not only did we have to wait an extra hours over check in time we wasn t even contacted like we were told we would be this hours meant we were late for our evening plans and we didn t even get a later check out time or anything complimentary not happy about this experience
