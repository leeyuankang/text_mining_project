we arrived a little early just after and were told the room wasn t quite ready and to get a complimentary coffee whilst waiting fine but it wasn t ready until housekeeping knew we were there at so this was not acceptable especially at a so called star we were given a voucher for off lunch or off dinner to compensate not off breakfast which might have been usable we had a king room room the carpet was dirty the pillows were flat and hard and the shower was over the bath in a huge bathroom english breakfast was we didn t bother to stay for it we may have been unlucky with the service but we have stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel was probably the most disappointing on a positive note we had a lovely view over kensington palace from our room we wouldn t stay there again
