the heater is very very loud and you cannot sleep when it is on i ask the reception for a solution and they promised to fix it but they never follow up it happened every night till the last night we spoken to the night manager and he himself managed to give us a portal heater what they were able to give us from the day as i booked the room in non refundable rate for the first time even if i wanted to leave the hotel first day they charged then i stayed hoping for an improvement i had just one night sleep out of nights stay all the furnitures got old and need to be replace for a five star hotel the floor carpet is dirty and ipod doc is still suitable for iphone no body cares about you and the worse feeling is ignorance even when i wanted to talk with morning manager at the check out he told me he is going to follow up the case and email me which they send me an email few hours after i left the hotel with the note that we checked and during your stay it was all the time the room temperature but they never mentioned that if you turn on the heater for not freezing you cannot sleep because it is the noisiest the point is that i was already there and i was unsatisfied maybe i felt better if they left me an excuse note during my stay after all you will feel cold ignored stayin in a moderate facilities room it is a star hotel now it was better in the past
