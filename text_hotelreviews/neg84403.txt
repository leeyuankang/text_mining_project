there was some confusion our room size we thought we booked for adults and staff but we re only provided with a single sofa bed in our room so not big enough for two children to sleep on the room was at the back and we were woken up by the rubbish men emptying what sounded like tonnes of recycling at on a saturday morning it just wasn t a great stay i ve booked one more weekend there that will be the deciding weekend to see if we stay there again
