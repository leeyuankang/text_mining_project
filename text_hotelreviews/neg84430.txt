we booked two rooms at the hotel before arriving we were told that we could check in from when we arrived at the hotel at we were told that we could check in to one of the rooms but not the other we were then not allowed to check in to the second room until that meant that we were rushing to get to our performance in the afternoon i find it incredibly disappointing that the hotel does not offer wifi as part of the price of the room particularly as prices begin at around a night how can this be justified
