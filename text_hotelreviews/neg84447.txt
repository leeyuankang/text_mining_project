the sofa bed for such a high quality hotel was awful it was made up for us while we were out and had a massive bend in the metal bar at the foot of it the house maid could not help but know this as we saw it on entering the room so it should have been fixed we had a man come and look at it but as it was it could not be replaced due to limited staff at that time of night so he and my husband bent it back up as best they could and he said a new one would be put in the following day it was not replaced and the following night it had a printed sign on it to say no sitting on the end of the bed we were not impressed felt it was a waste of our holiday time to follow up the issue we had similar beds over our weeks of travel and they were of a much superior quality than this one not good enough for this hotel
