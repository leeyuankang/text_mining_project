the shower is a bit weird as it has no separation from the rest of the room except for curtain so it can get very wet in the toilet if you are not careful we asked for an iron and the thing that was brought was very old and bit scary to use on white tee shirts as the steam holes sputtered yellowish rusted bits when steam was on so we just gave my husband s shirt and trousers for pressing by the professionals in the hotel for pounds and it was done in half an hour the wifi is pounds a day which is pretty expensive but we were offered complimentary wifi for the whole stay because our room was not ready until pm
