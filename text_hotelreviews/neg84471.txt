had to change my room times time air condition didn t work then after days in the room they moved me out problem with water pipe moved me out in a bad way room air condition didnt work and they didnt care to fix and was tired to even talk to them hotel bar lobby small and the bar most of the time reserved you can t work or have a drink more important people reserved it than you are and no were else to work and you cant sit in the lobby and have a drink even the bar is closed you cant work in the lobby if you open your laptop to work and then you went to stretch your legs or toilet you laptop will disappear with all your stuff a security guard will remove them as its not allowed to leave your stuff in the lobby for more than seconds other wise they will take it and throw it out too expensive for this kind of service so stay away from this hotel also it needs refurbishing tv keeps hanging must plug it on off and small tvs
