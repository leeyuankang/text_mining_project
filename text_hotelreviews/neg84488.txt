the bedroom smelt of stale smoke and should have been identified by housekeeping i immediately raised the issue with reception and they sent an air spray no offer to move us to another room despite the housekeeper agreeing that the smell was unacceptable very poor customer service and as a returning lapsed guest i m unimpressed
