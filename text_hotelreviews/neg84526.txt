breakfast is very expensive and complicated when you arrive to the breakfast hall you have to wait until be seated then you have to choose between options english gbp and continental gbp and it was not clear about buffet then waiting time for tea coffee or toasts etc but food was delicious the staff was very helpfull and friendly but we had breakfast just once and they we ve decided to eat breakfast on the street near the hotel it was better and for reasonable price wifi is also expensive gbp day for this kind of hotel it should be for free they said it is because we had booking via the part booking com but
