the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above
