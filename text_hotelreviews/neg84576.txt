i booked a non smoking room as i got out of the lift onto the floor the smell of cigarette smoke hit me from the other rooms on the floor my room was clearly not a non smoking room as it smelt of cigarettes the duvet was the thinnest i have ever seen i was so cold in the night i slept in a sweater cashmere scarf with my coat on top of the duvet really shocking that a hotel of this calibre cannot provide good quality duvets i was charged for internet as i had booked through booking com later reimbursed for this
