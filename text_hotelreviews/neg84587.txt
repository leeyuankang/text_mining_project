wi fi is charged which is weird in this digital era the hotel has a business center room where you can use a computer and printer but the hotel does not have a standard for its application one day we used the computer there for free the other day the officer there wanted to charge us but we explained our reason it was for an address check in google maps so they allowed us free usage this is the first time i see a hotel where the business center is not free for hotel customers
