poor quality breakfast service no one came to the table to take an order we had to try and catch the eye of a waiter to ask for coffee ordered a pot for and it had only cups in it each food quality was not great either i ve had better breakfasts in hotels a quarter of the price they allow smoking in some of the rooms next door to no smoking rooms the smell of smoke was very strong in the corridors and would permeate into our no smoking room not pleasant even in a cheap hotel i would not expect that in a so called it is unacceptable hotel is overpriced and not delivering the service i expect from a star staff are generally unfriendly and not particularly helpful except for the doormen they were all really nice and friendly
