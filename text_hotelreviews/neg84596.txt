old hotel very poorly maintained my first had a leak from ceiling they made me change room in the middle of the night they appologized and promised they will do better next time i gave them benefit of the doubt i showed them the rate from booking com they couldn t match it and basically all they offered was a discount on breakfast for all the trouble i had i expected better from a so called hotel i booked on my own went there all i wanted was a clean and quiet room i get a broken toilet seat was about to fell disaster really and with all this they didn t even offer breakfast or anything management should change for sure it s not a nice way to treat clients
