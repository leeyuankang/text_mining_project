arrived carrying well travelled backpaks which we dropped on entering reception only to have some guy shove a card in my face telling me i m security are those your s well if he was really security he would have seen us arrive i truly feel that as we did not arrive by taxi carrying brand name luggage we were treated differently in my life i have learned not to judge a book by its cover and nor should the staff at this hotel treat us like commoners we have stayed at better classed establishments with better service and attention than was received at this one
