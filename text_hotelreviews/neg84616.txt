hotel draws on the kensington palace garden location but the room did not live up to standard expected for this high room rate per night a per hours for wifi charged for bookings made with booking com very too basic roomdecor a lac of luxury stained chair chipped off wood on bedside table tv cannot be watched from the bed but from a small uncomfortable window seat only bed had a thick plastic mattress protection which made a good night sleep uncomfortable
