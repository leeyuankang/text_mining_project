we were offered an upgrade to a deluxe room booked a superior at an additional euros per night with a balcony and coffee machine but the balcony was so small only one person could sit on it and no coffee was supplied for the machine we asked on occasions for coffee pods and ended up buying them at a super market the extra charge was not justified we could have bought a coffee machine for that we stayed nights we wish we have stuck with original booking and saved the money this has definitely affected our review of the hotel and had they taken that extra charge off we would have given more smiles very small breakfast area on morning there was no where to sit on another morning there was no food left and no one seemed interested in helping put any out so we went out we had a great breakfast for the same price elsewhere euros
