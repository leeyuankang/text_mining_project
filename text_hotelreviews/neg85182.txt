the main entrance is not easy to find and it s separated into buildings the conceiage is a very small counter the room and lobby are all very small with a old building smell poor facilities all the pictures on site are taken in wide angle it s not cost for money and there should be lots of choice is more convenience location with much better services facilities and environment i m very disappointed
