horrible staff messed up our check out bills twice charged us wrong amounts very unattentive i would not recommend this hotel to anyone also extremely small rooms for the amount they charge we could barely walk in it i thought it would be a lovely stay as per the online reviews but was very disappointed with overall staff service sorry
