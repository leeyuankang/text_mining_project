everything the room was full of flies when i got inside there was no air conditioning and since the place was hot they left the window open all very well then buy a flies screen my room was close to the elevator and the wall made a lot of noise when the elevator was functioning waking me up constantly during the night the carpet was dusty and the bathroom was in desperate need of redoing they should not call it hotel and not charge more than pounds per night i believe even hostels would be more glamorous than this
