we arrived at on a sunday evening i had specifically booked this hotel because i had stayed in other grange hotels and had great experiences and i wanted a bed room not a pull out sofa bed the description of the room and photos showed proper beds but when we arrived i found a double bed and a pull out sofa bed with an awful metal frame and no mattress when i enquirers about the discrepancy i was told i ll just finish cashing up and sort it out we also wanted something to eat and when i asked at reception i was shown a website of fast food places that will deliver to the hotel i asked if there were any restaurants nearby that would still be serving food i was told i don t really know seeing as how we couldn t go to sleep because of the lack of the bed we decided to take a short stroll to see what we could find within blocks of the hotel we found a lot of restaurants with last orders at how can front desk at a hotel not know the surrounding area customer service by the night staff was completely unacceptable overall the hotel is fairly run down and tired and it was not at all what i expected from a grange hotel
