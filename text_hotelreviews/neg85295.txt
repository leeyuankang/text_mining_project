staff weren t friendly and approachable our room was not cleaned once during our stay we asked for shampoo as there was none in our room when we checked in and still hadn t arrived by the time we left we didn t get clean cups for tea or clean towels and even ran out of toilet paper the bathroom was not cleaned upto standard and we will not be staying with a grange hotel again in my opinion this hotel is over priced and over rated
