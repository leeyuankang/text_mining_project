the hotel and room were less than that expected of a star property most of the room was old falling apart sloping floor blinds not attached to the fixings windows didn t close fully bed didn t reach the wall no headboard so had to put cushions in space upon arrival the hotel seemed to be undergoing work and this made the reception feel unwelcoming and unprofessional
