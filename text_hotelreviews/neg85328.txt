we had a room on the flr to the front of the hotel which was quite small and the floor sloped a lot from the window into the bathroom which proved to be quite hazardous as the bathroom floor was very shiny the side of the bath was high and even though we are fit it was awkward getting into the shower our biggest issue was however the noise even though the windows are double glazed and were shut the noise from the street was unbelievable and prevented us from sleeping people walking past at odd hours to the very early weekend bin lorries to the road being dug up at on saturday and sunday morning we struggled to sleep first impressions the street appears to be very elegant and quiet but this does not the case after dark
