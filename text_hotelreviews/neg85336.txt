although there are many good things about the hotel i found the check in process odd i had to confirm the rate which was written out and shown to me on a piece of paper and was then told very firmly that breakfast was not included as if i might try to claim it was it was not the most hospitable start i don t blame the receptionist it looked as if this was policy i was given a dark basement room where the grouting and sealant round the shower needed some maintenance although i was told this was an upgrade it felt as if the hotel did not know how to welcome gracefully guests who had a discount deal the hotel is swanky but the management needs to work harder to live up to the claim that this chain is for the most discerning travellers
