the temperature in the room was so high it turned my shower gel into liquid we did wonder why the window was wide open when we entered the room for the first time a bad nights sleep as you sweat through the night on top of the bed or have the window open and listen to the city go about its buisiness all night long a shame as the bed was really comfortable the staff cannot make tea the breakfast is shocking first of all it cost for two people for a bowl of serial and some fruit and the full english i had was made with the cheapest of ingredients in my opinion it was cheaper booked in advance but not much weak tea and very strong coffee which we declined to have refilled when offered
