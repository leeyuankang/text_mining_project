did not like the lower ground floor room i was allocated spacious but dirty carpet no nightstand next to the bed bed was of foldout type you would see in a student room sheets looked clean but didn t smell fresh everything looked tired with chipped paint and crappy sliding window panes which had to be opened because the room was heated to degrees celsius when i arrived no aircon
