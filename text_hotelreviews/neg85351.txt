it was a fold down bed not very comfortable no bedside tables lamps and limited power points for charging phones unless you unplug tv ones under mini bar too close to cabinet so large plugs dont fit the bed was missing a base sheet so had to call night reception to bring one the room was very warm and the only way to keep a window open was to prop it open with a drawer from the cupboard one of the window blinds was broken so unable to open maybe we were just unlucky with the room we were allocated room lower g
