breakfast was very chaotic we came down at and it was busy we were asked to wait in reception i thought we would be asked in at next available table i then noticed not long after a couple entered and did not join us realising they must have been seated we asked again and was told another five minutes when eventually seated after about fifteen minutes we were shown to a table our coffee order taken and my husband ordered toast nobody returned to take our english breakfast order my husband after a long wait started on his toast the waiter who took our coffee order had not returned the waitress who saw my husband eating his toast told us she thought the waiter had taken our order we saw people eating their full breakfast who had been seated after us we finally an hour after coming down we were served our breakfast my husband who is alergic to black pepper asked for two slices of bacon as he would not be able to eat sausages he was only given one slice also one half of tomatoe is very poor portion we did take this up at the time with the waiting staff and they were apologetic also we informed reception the evening before we checked out we were not charged for our breakfast we were offered a bottle of wine as compensation we did not think that was necessary we do think there should be some sort of extra training though for kitchen and waiting staff if you are charging for a breakfast then it should be a good one
