we usually book a delux or club room at this hotel but our funds were a bit tighter for this visit so we booked a superior standard room it was adequate for just going to bed in however the bathroom which only had a shower cubicle some have baths with built in baths our bathroom was ridiculously small no elbow room at all there was significant corrosion under the sink on the fittings and the wall was pitted beneath one of the switches in the bedroom area the heater was effective but very noisy and our window was rather drafty our room was to the rear of the hotel and by we could hear the faint sound of the tube station below the hotel even on the floor
