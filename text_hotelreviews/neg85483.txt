had trouble working out how to turn on hot water in the shower had several cold showers before imanaged to ask housekeeping how it worked i made the mistake of travelling from heathrow on the underground without water and with a large suitcase in the hot weather the tube is very hot and stuffy and became quite crowded i struggled bringing my suitcase to the hotel largely because i was dehydrated fortunately a staff member helped me as i approached the hotel
