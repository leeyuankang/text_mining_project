you come to expect reception staff to give you a very brief explanation of how to get to your room for example you ll find the elevators here go to x floor take a left etc but this was missing it s not immediately obvious that you need to scan your keycard to activate the lift either after a days flying not having to think about these things would be a nicer touch
