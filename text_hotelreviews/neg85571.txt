we had a great stay there was only two problems that we had we got refused a single shot for a g t at the main bar which is against the weights and measures act we were very disappointed i understand that their menu states that they are servings but it s illegal not to serve the single shot when we were eating our breakfast even though it was past there was over people still eating and the cleaner was vacuuming the restaurant i understand that you have to prepare the restaurant for lunch but while people are still eating i feel that it s inappropriate
