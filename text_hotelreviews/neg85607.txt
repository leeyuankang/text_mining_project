my husband made the booking i arrived earlier to my husband as he is with clients despite having id booking confirmation from my husband i was advised that i couldn t check in without him emailing the hotel told that i would need to sit in reception until he emailed but he was not contactable i was horrified never ever ever experienced such service i was advised that star hotels operate like this fact honestly stayed at many star hotels around the world fact worked in the industry for years fact star hotels provide truly inspiring service and customer friendly procedures many achieve this with ease not here patronised accused and having to hear what i can only describe as a rehearsed response over and over again i need an email i need an email had to pay a hidden room cover for insurance which gets refunded when my bank feels like it which is exactly what was said fact travelled the world worked in a very reputable travel company and still have contacts my advice stay elsewhere far far better service far less corporate procedures never ever again fine for business travel solo quick stop over hotel airport like in experience high on security and processes only
