worst hilton experience staff were quite busy when i was checking in maybe that s the reason i felt they don t have patient they offered me a room without window and charged me a large sum of money when i ask to change the same size room with window i am a solo traveller what surprised me was that they changed to a twin room rather than kingsize room at first so i had to go downstairs twice to ask them to make it right
