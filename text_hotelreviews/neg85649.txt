we stayed here for our wedding so i had left notes to inform the hotel prior upon check in i was told i would not be upgraded to the next room i asked why and i was told it was full nothing more was supplied i thought she would have offered a drink as a comp but nothing okay fair enough about later i was with my sister in law when she checked in and i thought i ll ask again just in case good thing i did the night manager immediately gave me a new room and apologised for the earlier conversation at check in so not sure why she had such an attitude anyway the wedding was the next day so we left the hotel at i was informed by my bridesmaid when she d gone back at that the room hadn t been cleaned but she d left word with reception that myself and my husband would be back that night if they could clean the room and throw in anything special that would be great well we got back at midnight the room hadn t been cleaned you d think a hotel like this would be better right the bed mattress was squeaky which implies cheap the pillows were too soft and using more didn t build any support sad to say but wouldn t go back here
