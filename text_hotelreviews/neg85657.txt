i was more than surprised to be overcharged for the room they did sort it out but they did not apologize and took the right money from my account when i wasn t in the hotel without checking with me first so tough luck if i didn t agree you can accept a corporate feel for less money but then you expect efficiency this had neither they have a lot to learn about charm and personal service when we complained that we did not have any tea bags in our room we had to ask twice before any arrived and then we were given two teabags penny wise and pound foolish we were in that hotel for days i liked it but it s the first time ever i have not left a tip
