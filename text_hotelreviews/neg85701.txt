my wife found drying her hair in the room difficult there were no mirrors in the room the only mirror was in the wardrobe and the socket in the opposite wall so i had to sit on the floor or pull the desk chair over but with no surface to put the brush products etc the coiled cable of the hairdryer was too tight to be pulled so made it very difficult to look in the mirror and style my hair small thing but annoying
