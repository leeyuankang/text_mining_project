i requested a early check in as we had a hour journey to get there on arrival i was told my room wouldn t be ready untill we arrived at am but the hotel was told of that in advance but could have another which was ready for a further bit steep considering what we payed anyway so we didn t really save anything on booking through booking com nice hotel but keep it in mind if you want to check in early you will be paying a supplement maybe i m being cynical but i m being honest
