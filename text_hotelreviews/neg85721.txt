we are a same sex couple at check in the receptionist asked us if we were ok with a double which i had booked in the first place and i said yes that s what i requested he then asked if we would prefer a twin room it made the situation really embarrassing for me as i then had to say no it was like he was dilberately fishing for information all the other staff in the hotel were very nice
