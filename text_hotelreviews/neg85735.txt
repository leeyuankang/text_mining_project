the only thing i could have found fault with on our stay was that breakfast was a little unorganised we had to queue different ends of the buffet to order the cooked items and sauces which meant by the time we sat down some items on our plate were cold that said for one of the items the chef personally delivered it to our table my point in only that surely there should be a better way of managing this perhaps order extra items at the table as you are seated and then served by the waiter waitress as i have experienced in the past in order hotels also it was very pricey each if not pre booked and if you had it made the bowls of cereal sold for at the local trendy cereal cafe for a bowl a bargain i m sure hilton would still make a very healthy profit at per head
