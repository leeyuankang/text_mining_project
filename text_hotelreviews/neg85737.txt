the fact we were only given two small milks and two teabags in room so after making a cup of tea in the evening had to go down to reception in the morning to get some more to have a cup when we woke also the price of breakfast is ridiculous at each on top of an expensive room luckily there is a lovely cafe just up the room called carlos cafe which did a lovely breakfast we were also rudely awakened at in the morning by alarms which were set off by someone in the shower apparently ruined a otherwise comfortable night
