at check in for my previous visit i was offered a voucher for a free drink although i understand that that might have been an exception i asked the staff member at check in she then asked me if that was pet of my confirmation and i didn t know she informed me that that was not the case and that she could not give me a voucher when i showed the details of the previous check in there was also no notice of a drink included in the reservation soon recon it was offer of goodwill but unfortunately although understandable it could not be granted this time it s more the tone way it was handled could have been a bit better can t plug in hairdryer in the bathroom
