we mentioned it was my wife s birthday and asked for a cot crib when we booked the hotel staff didn t know about the birthday and didn t put a cot crib in addition even though they upgraded us to a bigger room it only had a shower and not a bath which is not very convenient with a baby babies don t take showers only after we mentioned they moved us to a room with a bath they didn t supply a cot crib or an explanation as to why they didn t in past visits to hotels when we mentioned we were coming to celebrate our birthday we had something nice waiting for us in the room perhaps not a big deal but at least bother to read comments customers write you in advance we personally were disappointed by that it s worth mentioning that the complimentary soft drinks had nothing to do with the birthday in the restaurant our waitress federica hope i remember the name right was lovely staff were nice in general as well however it seemed as if the restaurant staff in general were always in some sort of rush even when the restaurant is pretty empty we did come pretty late to the restaurant on both nights but the atmosphere didn t seem quite right one of the nights we got served a totally burnt burger not sure how the chef thought this was edible but we did get a discount because of that so not much of a problem the desserts were delicious
