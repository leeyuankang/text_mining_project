well where do i start the hotel made a mistake with my rooms and insisted in was my fault even though i had an email from them confirming my stay and rooms they down graded my rooms and then refused to refund the difference i contacted bookings com and unfortunately did not get a difference in the room rate although the hotel then admitted to making a mistake the damage was done the hotel tried the best to do some service recovery offering free breakfast i travel a lot for work and all i can say is don t try and argue with customers until you are sure
