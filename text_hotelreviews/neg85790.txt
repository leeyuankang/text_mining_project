i stated in my booking request that i had booked a room as a special engagement trip and asked if anything could be arranged i called and was told something would be arranged upon arriving upon arriving i was told there was a deluxe upgrade at or another upgrade with lounge access for or so very awkward time to ask for more money when i was trying to be subtle about the engagement not the best experience upon checking in small things like slippers weren t in the room nor the complimentary water and only one bathrobe felt strange calling for each of these items as i discovered it not a smooth stay
