the hairdryer is on an extremely short spiraled cable and all plug sockets are low down so trying to dry your hair meant the plug kept coming out of the wall there is also no vanity mirror or area for use whilst drying hair applying make up the only mirrors are in the bathroom and there are no non bathroom plug sockets which is obviously key to safety but doesn t allow for styling hair in mirror whilst drying there were no cotton buds or cotton pads which i feel are standard and means you don t need to pack your own plus the only time i ve ever needed a sewing kit and non available in the room
