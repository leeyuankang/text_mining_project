wife had an issue that there were no mirrors to get ready in outside of bathroom and its a bit strange the set up with the lights we did have a maid walk in on us both naked at which wasn t great but hotel were apologetic and gave us free breakfast nothing that i would say should put you off from staying here at breakfast is a bit pricey but if u get it there is lots to eat
