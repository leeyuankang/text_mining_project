i paid extra for room with city view i was expecting a view of london skyline but i had a view of a block of flats through a small window city view means your room faces the outside of the hotel whereas non view rooms overlook an internal courtyard which in my opinion is a better view than city view i don t think city view should be used in description as it s misleading
