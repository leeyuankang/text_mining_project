we had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this
