the rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom and for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and i felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from honestly i was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to london for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this i definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small not sure if i may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a poster bed which when i purchased the superior double room i expected to get and if what i got was a superior double room i would like to see how big a suite is another point would be the view i wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however the view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better one rude female member of staff at reception see first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout london however it is here i am almost sure that i booked the hotel room and i received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff i previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing i wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the london eye or houses of parliament and the thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful
