the photos are enhanced on the internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if i m honest a bit dreary from outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of windows it needs sensitively being freshened up throughout the decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded we had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely i wouldnt stay again
