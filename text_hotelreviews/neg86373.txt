the male deputy reception manager rafael had an appalling attitude deeply upset me and offended me to the point i was annoyed i would not use hilton again because of his lack of empathy and disregard for a clients requirements rooms are tiny also and shower was dirty i was told the hotel doesn t book through booking com and any requests made via the site are not noted or actioned internet would not work on any device i had either and once again the manager was not interested and said he couldn t help this was the worst hotel experience i have had in six months
