there were two problems during my stay i paid for breakfast on saturday sunday and monday morning but was told after i had my breakfast on the table that i was not entitled to breakfast on monday morning as i had not paid and that if i wanted it it would cost saturday and sunday mornings were fine i was then asked to leave without eating anything this was so embarrassing after collecting my things and checking out i mentioned it to the staff on the front desk who told me i had paid for breakfast on monday morning and that i should have had it at this point it was too late and i left the doubletree with a really bad feeling and hungry as i had paid for something i was denied i probably wouldn t go back as a result despite its safe and clean rooms i was on the floor and it was really noisy from the noise started people banging doors and chatting in the corridor not good for jet lag or a good night s sleep
