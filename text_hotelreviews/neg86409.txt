had to wait minutes for my room as they had double booked us and even now i m not sure if it was a deluxe very small they did give us two free drinks tokens asked for guinness and well it was awful also waited minutes for two sandwiches on room service unfortunately we had to cancel as we had to leave tried to get in through the front door but was informed that we had to go round the back outside areas were full of cups and glasses and no ashtrays which is very strange for a smoking area
