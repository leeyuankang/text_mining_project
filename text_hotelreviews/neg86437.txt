the room was too cold because the heating system wasn t working we called the reception and they sent us somebody he said he could offer us a portable heater which we agreed to but afterwards he didn t show up and we had to call again to finally get it the breakfast was only ok i honestly was expecting that at least a cappucino would be included in the price of breakfast in a four star hotel but there only was not so great filter coffee and to get something better we had to order from starbucks which for me personally wasn t an option since it s really not my favourite
