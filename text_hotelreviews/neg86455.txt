i have put poor for cleanliness and comfort due to the room smelling of sewage not due to actually visual cleanliness this was perfect and beds were very comfortable it was the smell coming up from the sink so had to have the plug closed and water in to try and disguise the smell and window open not that it helped much i would be extremely surprised if we were not the first people to comment on this not what i expect from a double tree
