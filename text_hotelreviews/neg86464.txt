we were in a disabled access room so plenty of room the bathroom was more like a wet room for showering with a wheelchair however there wasn t anywhere to put toiletries in wet room bathroom apart from floor or cistern of toilet which is where the toilet roll was lying loose no toilet roll holder had to reach behind which was ok for us but may have been a problem for someone actually disabled we were advised the sink would be low it being a disabled room however it was one of the smallest sinks i ve ever encountered could not fill kettle as it would not fit otherwise hotel and room very good
