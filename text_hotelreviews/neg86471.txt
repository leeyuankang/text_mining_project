the room was super warm on arrival and the aircon was so slow the tv remote had no batteries and we waited for for someone to help us the towels were old and crusty and the bed sheets had stains for per night it was a very over priced hotel should of offered us some form of apologise ridiculously priced starbucks and the breakfast in the morning was horrid no food stocked up the tables a mess and not wiped and the waitress took over half an hour to deliver my eggs my partner had already eaten his breakfast by the time my eggs arrived to the table overall we won t ever recommend or go back to the hotel
