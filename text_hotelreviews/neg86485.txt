when we arrived very late after our flight we just wanted to shower but there were no toiletries in our room not even hand soap we had to call the desk and wait for a while before they were brought to us and nobody said sorry about that then our wash basin sink had a very bad drainage problem so it took so long to drain and was very inconvenient also a couple of towels had black spots on them
