overall a poor experience at this hotel was not told about card deposit when booking online told the receptionist i did not have right card with me and that i planned to come back he called me on the room phone to reiterate which i thought that was out of order went out and left the free to clean sign on the door handle but the room was not services upon my return was expecting a higher standard from this hotel
