the alarm had been set for by the previous guest so woke me up very early on the first night of our stay and again on the second but couldn t figure out how to stop it this time so snooze went of times before i managed to achieve this so may i suggest that when a guest vacates a room your cleaners could clear the alarms as routine when making up a room for a new guest
