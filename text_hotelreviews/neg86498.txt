just make sure that you get a room at one of the the floors if you are staying here with the intention of relaxing and sleeping they rent out the ground floor to events that play really loud music untill i had to complain once wait for nothing to happen call a second time and demand that they provided a new room for us as it was impossible to sleep they did find us a new room but getting out of bed to pack and move to a different room at midnight disapointed
