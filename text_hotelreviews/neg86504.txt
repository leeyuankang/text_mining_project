the location was awful the building is hideous looks like an old office block the staff did not look very happy we were never asked at any time how our room or stay was going on arrival i tried to engage with the receptionist telling her about our journey and where we had come from she looked at me like i was demented this was at on a sunday night no one was rushed off there feet on departure we were not asked any questions at all about our stay room visit no small talk even tho i was the only one at the desk then it does appear to have a lot of eastern europeans on the staff it was not a nice stay the only guarantee is i will never cross the door of this place again fed up being promised the earth by booking web sites and getting poor accommodation our pets have more personal space than we were afforded in this hotel poor customer service
