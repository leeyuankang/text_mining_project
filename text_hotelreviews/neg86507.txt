bit annoying when unable to check in at for check in and a queue to re join at to see if there is a room available yet we attended for a local event at wembley and were frustrated we were late as a result this must be a common occurrence due to this hotel s location and we booked due to good check in time and so would be v helpful if check in was quicker and definitely available at busy street with traffic
