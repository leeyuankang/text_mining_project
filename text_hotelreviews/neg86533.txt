the staff were unhelpful and not very friendly we are not from around the area so asked for help regarding travel to wembley and were only told about getting a taxi no other options told so we had to seek the information ourselves i was very angry that someone complained about having to pay for parking and so they were given it free of charge when i had to pay surely this is not fair i also was not happy that when we arrived late on in the evening the man who served us at reception said to a colleague something about not having a room which made me worry after a short while we were given a room which was clearly for a disabled customer as there was no bath the sink was very low down so hard to use i felt as though we were just shoved in a room and been forgotten about also despite putting the sign on our door to not disturb us we were woken up at by the cleaner walking straight in overall we were not impressed and would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone i am very disappointed and would appreciate an email regarding the issues raised please
