the hotel rooms are quite small they were clean but in need of decoration the entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate we didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on different floors we booked these rooms over months in advance we were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed i would not rate this hotel as a star it s a in my opinion
