felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped i would not of paid the price we did for the room if i had seen it before hand i feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of would never use this chain of hotels again
