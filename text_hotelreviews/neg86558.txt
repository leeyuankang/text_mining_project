the eggs at breakfast were cold did not have any toast as there were too many people waiting would prefer to have toast served at the table the tea at breakfast was rather horrid not hot enough poured from a thermos teapot individual pot of tea at the table would be much better did not bother with the hotel car park as it is much cheaper to park on the road just outside parking in the hotel car park should be free for guests staying
