the room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really the window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy but my main gripe is that on arriving i was told i have to provide a credit card i didn t have the same card on me as i booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount when i got home i noticed that i had been charged twice and i phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take days for the money to be returned to my account it would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues
