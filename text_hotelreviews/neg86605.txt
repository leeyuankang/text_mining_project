at i was woken by a massive argument in the room below and then by conversations just outside the hotel by hotel residents not the hotel s fault but the noises continued even at and shortly after the noise from the north circular kicked off the windows weren t very sound proof at all i was also in a room which had a door to enable the size of the accommodation to be increased frankly at times it was like having someone else in the room especially the next morning when the resident was clearing his throat for the best part of an hour if i stay again i will insist on a room at the back with no adjoining room capability
