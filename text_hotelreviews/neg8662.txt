the room was absolutely tiny the smallest i ve ever stayed in my boyfriend is and they put us in a room in under the eaves the night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested mtv was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or star status we were also not informed of the renovation works being done the whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas the building work outside woke us up at about this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough our stay was not that of a four star hotel
