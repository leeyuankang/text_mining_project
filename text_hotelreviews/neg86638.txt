the room though very well appointed was erm a bit compact but i had no problem with it ordered a sandwich in bar at after they theoretically closed service at they served me so good service that they did provide the sandwich the bad bit was that the bread wasn t fresh and sandwich had been made for sometime and not covered not so bad that i couldn t eat it but not really very good for the outrageous price good that they immediately canceled the charge for the sandwich upon my complaining service can t be faulted there
