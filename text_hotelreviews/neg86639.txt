this let down the rest of the very good stay the two room services meals on both evenings of our stay were only luke warm and the toast of the panini which was actually only sliced bread was not properly toasted it was disappointing we did not take this up at the time because it was late and we needed to eat and sleep rugby world cup was tiring we did mention at check out and were offered a free coffee
