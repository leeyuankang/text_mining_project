we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark the rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins however the rooms we moved to in the basement and were much more spacious
