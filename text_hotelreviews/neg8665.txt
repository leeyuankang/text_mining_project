when we arrive the hotel we rooms for nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about months in advance we were very disappointed it was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station
