we were first shown room which was so small it should only be listed as a single certainly not as a double but we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better so i cannot fault the service the bathrooms are fabulous best i have ever seen however the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas the bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there we came back in at around pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area others came in later and had to stand unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed which is a shame as it is a beautiful building all in all a nice stay but not a great one
