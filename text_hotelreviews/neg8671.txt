the only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed so we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate the bathroom was small but had a bath the room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best they never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter the check in process was a pain we arrived at so minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready that was ok and we decided to wait in the hall no one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after minutes i had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else when we finally got the key minutes later we had to wait another minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for london
