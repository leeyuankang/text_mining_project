wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel on arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the tvs were shut down with no signal on the screen totally dissapointed i made sure staff where aware on our last morning i took it upon myself when i got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since september had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing avoid
