booked in october for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in january it was around cheaper staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom back of bathroom door was very dirty very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel
