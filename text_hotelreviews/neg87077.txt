restaurant and food options are very poor for such a nice place staff has a good attitude but has not the experience nor the reactivty of a star hotel we went to have dinner on the tapar bar on the terrace they had no more meat left and it is supposed to be a grill bbq tapas bar the service was also very slow and unorganized drinks come after the dishes i ask for an ash tray and the waiter points me the next table and says you got it there anyway with some simple training and internal organsation everything can be resolved the place is really nice and great things to offer considering its location
