my boyfriend and i wanted to spend a special christmas in london and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish london hotel the room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised it was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the s or something the breakfast was pounds per person which is ridiculous the staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare the bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks overall i was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel our room looked straight out of a motel and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move this was not a supposedly a star grand royale hotel i will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in london for the amount we paid we expected a lot more its not as advertised
