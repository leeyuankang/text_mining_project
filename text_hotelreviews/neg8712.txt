the place was nothing like the picture on the website we requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket after they put it together we didn t fit the room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable i didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but i regret not spending more ando going to a better place
