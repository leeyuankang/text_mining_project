we stayed in room no view at all in that room in fact the windows are small but there s nothing to look at anyway any room on the left side of the hallway will not have a view at all the room was very small the bed was not comfortable our room wasn t cleaned everyday actually it was only cleaned twice in days also just about all of the tv channels were in french we brought our apple tv with us just in case that happened but the wifi was horrible so it kept cutting out last but certainly not least there was a fee of euros for a late checkout plus a prorated fee for the time we were late checkout is at we thought checkout was at at we received a call from the lady at the front desk i informed her i didn t know what time checkout was we d be right down we got downstairs at and we were charged a late fee plus a prorated fee for every late hour so it s a charge on top of a charge i have never been charged for a late checkout i was very upset
