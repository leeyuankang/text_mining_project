our room was on the street side where traffic people returning from parties etc caused unslept nights due to huge noise our room was a suite with two rooms but with only one real and small window therefore the room is not very light bathroom would require a lot more attention there is only one hook for towels but the room can hold people the room would need more small tables or something that you can place you small items onto we also felt disappointed as the pictures from web site showed nicer view than you finally got from that one window you couldn t really see the eiffel tower at all
