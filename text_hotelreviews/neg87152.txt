the exterior of the hotel didn t look like the picture it was in fact an old run down looking building but that s perhaps paris for you we wanted to keep the room for more hours on the day we was leaving but the hotel wanted half a days rate which was this was extortionate i requested an eiffel tower view which i was supposed to pay extra for but the view was of the tip of the eiffel tower and not the full view of the tower as advertised we in fact got a view of the railway line i was not charged for this view though but i would have refused to pay for it if i was in fact charged whilst inside this hotel was lovely i don t think the hotel reflected the price at all i could have got a bigger and slightly more luxurious hotel for the same price or perhaps a little bit more
