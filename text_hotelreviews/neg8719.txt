we didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the metropolitan hotel this was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day in addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the grand royale the sister hotel did not meet our expectations either when we returned to the grand royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room all in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in london for two nights
