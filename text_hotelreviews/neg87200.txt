the express check out form was not delivered to my room i had to check out at the counter a lady in glasses said to me that i had to pay pounds for the dinner on my first night which i checked in very late about ten at night i never had this kind of experience before with the hilton i said that was not possible and i didn t had any service on my first night she still insisted that i had to pay because she had the data in the computer that i ordered foods to my room i asked her the time of the order she is very rude without the answer but asked me back what time that i checked in this is a liitle thing that made me annoyed i asked for the signed bill which usually had to attached with the client s receipt or port folio when you stayed at the good governance hotel her answer was no there was not if i want to see it i have to wait for she had to go downstairs and bra bra but if you are in hurry you have to pay this until our investigtion is finished which i can not tell you definitely how long it would take i just want you to consider and see how this is going on by asking the lady at the front desk but this is not polite and i found that the system is in bad shape for hilton you should never ask the hilton honour clients to pay without showing their signed bills thank you for your consideration than sura
