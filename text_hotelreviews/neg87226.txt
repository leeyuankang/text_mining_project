we got upgraded to a bigger which is great but the extra sofa bed wasn t meant for sleeping luckily we had a king size bed and we all had to sleep in the bed together all of us the housekeeping tried to bring an extra bed sheet to put on the sofa but still not fit to sleep due to the old spring sofa bed hopefully the extra bed will be changed else for a family of would be a bit of challenge to stay or share together
