the noisiest room i ve ever stayed in the room was overlooking the station and whilst we were expecting some train noise we didn t bargain on the incessant rumbling scraping noises from a waste recycling plant next to the railway sidings which seemed to be going all through the night when i complained the next morning the receptionist stated she had been told about this before but thought the plant should only be operational for one hour during the night i managed to get very little sleep because of the noise and this was despite the background noise of the air conditioning fan which we had on full blast to try and drown out the racket
