i have stayed in double tree hotels a few times and this one unfortunately let the side down a little the room was good but the floor was a little dirty and the shower and bathroom had the signs of a quick rinse rather than a thorough clean the breakfast was a little lack lustre and not much choice for the money you pay i would expect a little more attention to detail a bit more finesse and certainly a really clean room in addition the website informs you that on a premier king deluxe you will have a mini bar and a fridge no mini bar and the fridge was as warm as the room was
