staff gave an unapproachable unhappy vibe lack of information presented to you on check in breakfast only served until was in contact with the help desk multiple times in advance of booking who were helpful in providing me assurance of an early check in due to an event i was attending but when i arrived at the hotel the woman on reception was very blunt and said that no request had been notified and told me to come back at to check in i returned at around to the help of a male receptionist who was very helpful and provided me with another room that was available
