on our first night we asked the sour faced barman if food was available without speaking he looked at his watch and then threw a couple of menus down on the bar we took them to a seating area and were chatting and looking at the menus i briefly went to the toilet and when i came back my friend told me the barman had taken the menus away i saw a member of staff serving people with big plates of food so enquired to her if food was still available her reply was food finished one minute ago so the attitude of the bar staff and lack of basic communication got our weekend break off to a very poor start we went to bed hungry after travelling all day is that how a four star hotel operates it was very embarrassing as my friend was visiting from abroad and had been travelling all day yet they allowed east european prostitutes to bring bags of smelly mcdonalds into the bar and eat them there without buying any drinks
