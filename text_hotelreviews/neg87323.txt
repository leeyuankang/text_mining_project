the shower in the room was blocked and being at the end of the corridor every temperature change took minutes room this meant i nearly scalded then froze my old daughter when we thought that was sorted she ended up in floods of tears because water quickly began to flood the floor maintenance came quickly but none of us wanted to use the shower after that then the air conditioning could not be turned off it repeatedly reset to far warmer than suited us and the noise when i tried to get it to cool the room made it hard to sleep i was going to call down again but the kids were extremely tired by this time and didn t want another person in the room with us all in night clothes furthermore they charged me twice for an adult breakfast when only myself and one child were eating and offered no concession for the previous night s issues this was an expensive stay as a treat for the kids and i wish i d booked somewhere cheaper i stay in london for business regularly and thoroughly believe had i been in my suit and heels i would have been treating significantly better
