wellllll there were issues with the room it was a warm day and i wanted to turn the air conditioning on i would set it and it would return to degrees c then i tried to open the window and though there was a sign that it just tilted in for safety purposed i thought at least some air would be nice it would not open not matter what i did a workman came and adjusted the air and it was fine but it was exceedingly loud luckily in this case i wear hearing aids made it tolerable when i slept he then started repairing the window but after about a half hour or so and installing some hardware he sort of gave up to work on it in the future my toilet was running for while but straightened itself out after i was away for a while housekeeping accidentally turned off my bedside table and i had to get someone up to show me how to restore it i assumed the black buttons were decorative i had tried pushing them down but it seemed they worked by tipping them the only other issue i had and i assume this is a british construction issue because i found it elsewhere i nearly tripped on the high marble doorstep to the bathroom
