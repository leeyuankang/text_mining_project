wifi was difficult to log into the extra camp bed in our room was very uncomfortable and noisy the room was too small for it my friend and i travelled with my year old daughter and so booked a family room but i feel this kind of booking requires a larger room not just a regular double with a camp bed inserted in the corner there was very little room to move about
