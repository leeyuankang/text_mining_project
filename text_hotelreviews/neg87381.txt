when arrived for checking in the staff member was very rude with attitude the staff member slammed our room key on the side and we got left to our own devices we also got asked for a deposit which we never got told about until arrival a little later in my partner and i went to the bar to order a few drinks there was three staff members behind the bar but yet it took five minutes for them to actually acknowledge us overall i was disappointed with the stay as it was a surprise getaway for my partners birthday
