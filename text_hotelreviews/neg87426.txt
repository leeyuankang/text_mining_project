front desk staff was incompetent and inefficient i booked a txin room and paid upon arrival my friend was staying an extra night so this was arranged the night of the and she gave them her card for securing the reservation for the additional night i learned from her that whe she was checking out she was told that she needed to pay over as i had not paid pathetic the room also only had toiletries for person i was unimpressed by the lack of professsionalism and attention this is not service typical of a double tree nor of a hilton hotel
