the resturant was far too small to accommodate guests i you were practically sat on each other reception weren t partially helpful we had to spend on night with an unmade spare bed which was unacceptable pillows and sheets were not the best not very comfortable even compared to premier inn i wouldn t stay again or partially go out of my way to tell ppl out the hotel
