i don t agree with taking off our credit card which cannot be offset against our extras bill the last time we stayed in a doubletree hilton in london they took off per guest and it was a pending transaction against my credit card for weeks after midnight you cannot use cash at the bar card only small things but issues that can niggle breakfast was ok but if i d had to pay each extra for it i d not have been too happy it was adequate nice fresh omelette just ok cup of tea my favourite part of breakfast normally
