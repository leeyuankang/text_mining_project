breakfast felt crowded although we were able to be seated quickly we think it was because the tables were close together and when getting our food at the buffet there was not a lot of room also ideally they need a better way to cross the road from the station to the front entrance there is a cross walk but farther down in the wrong direction of the station so you have to loop back but this is being picky
