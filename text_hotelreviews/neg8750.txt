work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were tiny very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room there was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos the cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests the staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic they did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price
