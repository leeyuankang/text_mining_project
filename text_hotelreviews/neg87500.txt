i did not like the very cold room i was assigned to i called reception who dispatched a maintenenace staff member who vacuumed the air filter which was totally clogged this did help the air flow to a large extent but did not increase the temperature to a comfortable are all of your air filters as filthy as this was it is a health issue as you will realise i have not rated the cleanliness of the room as the room itself was all right and the housekeeper should not be held responsibel for the state of the filthy air conditioner
