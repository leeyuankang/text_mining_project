no twin rooms for the disabled reservations did not contact me to say they could not honour my special request for a walk in shower so they booked a normal room so had to share a bed with my friend in the disabled room heating not working in the disabled room allocated the other disabled room smelled of smoke so we could not stay in that so we were moved to an executive room instead but there was work being carried out right next to the room so there was banging clanging all day from early morning
