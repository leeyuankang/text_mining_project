restaurant staff very unprofessional upon finishing our course set menu meal we requested the bill when we checked the bill it was incorrect we pointed out this mistake it was corrected when we received the second bill we again noticied another minor mistake on the charge for our deserts i e an additional as a matter of principle we brought this to the attention of the same waitress who started arguing with us about the choice of desert we had ordered and size she had not taken our desert order and we advised her she was incorrect as we had ordered the desert off the set menu to avoid further annoyance and stress we settled the bill it was very dissapointing to be treated this way especially as we were staying in the hotel and spending lots of money there during our stay
