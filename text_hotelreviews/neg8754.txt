the value for place is absolutely ridiculous the price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received i would give this hotel minus just for the location the hotel charged mi pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for i have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details
