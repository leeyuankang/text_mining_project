room service was pretty poor with dinner they forgot to bring an ordered beer then returned with the wrong one fair enough not a big issue however breakfast arrived but just after leaving the hotel chap realised that the food delivered was for a different room so returned to take it away and return with our food about minutes later missing the toast again in isolation not a big deal but with mistakes on both our requests for room service it wasn t impressive and less so considering charge applied for the service
