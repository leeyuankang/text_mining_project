the taking of an extra from my bank account which still hasn t been returned this was not explained at the booking stage when i mentioned this to the employee on reception she told me it was only frozen and would immediately be put back into my account on checking out this hasn t happened as yet and there may be various business reasons for this however being told prior to booking and also that it would take days for the money to reappear in my account is negligent particularly at this time of year when most people s finances are stretched and i choose for ethical reasons not to use credits cards etc
