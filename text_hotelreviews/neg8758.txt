grand royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard we had to ask to switch rooms as the tv didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed this hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates
