this property is way overpriced for what you get especially the breakfast one of the front desk managers completely darkened our whole stay there she was particularly rude and sarcastic regarding some travel problems we were having she offered no solution literally talked back to me did not even treat me with basic sensitivity nor as a customer whose satisfaction was important she seemed to have no regard for the fact that she herself is a public representative of the hilton but rather she acted as though she was doing me a favor by just being there even there are of hotels to choose from i will never go back there or recommend this property and i may never choose hilton again because of giulya
