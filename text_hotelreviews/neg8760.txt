it was the worst experience i reached there am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem they have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room they never contacted us or phoned to say anything moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy ac which we couldn t use to heat the room so it ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed
