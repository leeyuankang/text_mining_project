we booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and i had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than macdonalds restaurant there were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests
