the window in our room was broken and couldn t be opened the televisions sound kept going up and down a couple of things at breakfast although i feel it was due to a particular member of staff who on the first morning forgot about our poached eggs and by the time we got them they were more like hard boiled the second morning he completely forgot about the pot of tea and when we did get it there wasn t any milk by this time our breakfast was finished
