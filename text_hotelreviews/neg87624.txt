the mattress was not as great as we imagined it would be for the standards of this worldwide known hotel the sink in the bathroom was clogged since we arrived and we thought the cleaner is going to take care of it the following morning but for days nothing changed and we didn t tell at the reception desk as every time there was few people waiting the bedroom was a bit too small in our opinion so quite disappointing for the price we paid we are not sure to come back even though the location is great
