lock on bedroom door was broken exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc at checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite the room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available the upgrade was clearly a con we d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset the family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos the bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture it lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the windows the beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double when we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my beer tab from the bill my wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated no restaurant or room service we were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked staff were pleasant enough
