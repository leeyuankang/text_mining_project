we got upgraded to a club room lord knows what standard is like room almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value bar closed at and breakfast was a whopping each we didn t have it
