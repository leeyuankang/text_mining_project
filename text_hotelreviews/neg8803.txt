arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready ok so they had a problem won t hold that against them asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and i had upgraded to a so called club room taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny frankly if i hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre i would have found somewhere else the bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard the room was very small and there was no natural light windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area we were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but i don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller just labelling the door club room is meaningless my basic beef is that i paid extra for what i considered was a very basic room didn t have breakfast there after checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could i gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied sadly would not stay again booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience
