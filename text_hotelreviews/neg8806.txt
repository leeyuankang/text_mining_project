a huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration i booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with british charm and character what i discovered when i arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room this was not disclosed when i booked and i wouldn t have reserved if i had known in advance they requested full payment on my credit card when i checked in and i regret agreeing to that as i should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere so if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed
