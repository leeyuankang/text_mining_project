price is bit high for the size of the room per say but considering its located in only minutes from oxford street and its right next to hyde park its quite nice pricing they should have resupplied water on the second day as well no fridge available in the room no slippers provided breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical english style and it is rather subjective matter
