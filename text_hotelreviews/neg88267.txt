for the price this hotel is not good value for money the rooms are small and the decor rather gaudy unfortunately there was so much road work going on around the hotel that it made getting about almost impossible and while this isn t the hotel s fault it did colour our impressions of the hotel s location while the staff were pleasant enough the breakfast was ordinary and not what i would have expected for the price
