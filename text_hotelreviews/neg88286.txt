i like to crack my windows and smokers would gather under my windows and so i had to close them again till they were gone i am advocating even a non smoking policy for open air public areas i was overall stunned with the great numbers of smoking persons everywhere in london horrible like being in egypt i travel a lot in us so maybe i am a bit brainwashed plus as a doctor i have made it my lifelong mission to discourage all people from smoking
