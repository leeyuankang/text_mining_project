poor heating in the room i cannot remember the room number but it was on the same level as the bee terrace we had maintenance look into the problem with it being fixed but it was still cold in the room also there were little moths flying in the room the parking cost for two nights overall not worth the money there are too many other places just book in advance months for other places as they all seem to book up quickly
