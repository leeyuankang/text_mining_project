i had booked online and was informed i could pay at the property the hotel debited my account on the friday prior to my stay on the sunday which i wasn t overly concerned with as i had no plans to cancel on checking in they asked for the balance of the room i explained that the money had already been debited from account and i was told that it was just to hold the room and i would need to pay again so in theory i have paid twice for the room i have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within days but this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again
