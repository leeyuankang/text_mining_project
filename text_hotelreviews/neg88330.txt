we have been coming to the st ermins hotel for years well before it became a marriott and lost most of its unique character all references to its long history as an important building in westminster at the history of its name the redesign by an undoubtedly modern designer who designs uncomfortable tables and chairs throughout the hotel but this is not the best we checked in at in the morning and the receptionist not english with a bad command of the language told us we would have to wait note was travelling with a lady of years so we had lunch and returned to the reception only to find out they had reallocated the ground floor rooms with easy acces and a walk in shower which had been expressly reserved months prior to someone else the manager then attempted to offer another hotel in london we declined so after another hours wait they gave us two very uncomfortable and tiny box rooms at the back of the hotel not acceptable so i complained and had to wait a further hour and they found us two other rooms adjacent with a shower but not on the grond floor for the year old lady not appropriate much too much walking as it was as far away from the lifts as it could have been we got into these rooms at pm madame was by this time exhausted the manager was completely useless and simply said he was sorry the service throughout the stay was dreadful with staff who barely speak english and management completely incompetent we received no apology from the management in a note or letter to madame the standards at this hotel have sunken a dreadful stay we will not be repeating
