not so much didn t like but small details of consideration perhaps baked beans mushrooms and either friend or poached eggs to be available as part of the buffet breakfast would seem better value for money access to a full english breakfast as well as a continental one given the hotel is located in our capital staff were friendly and helpful although i have zero complaints one or two could people could ve been more willingly helpful and enthusiastic by asking if we needed any city maps wake up calls or personal requirements on arrival would just give it that outstanding rather than good in this area
