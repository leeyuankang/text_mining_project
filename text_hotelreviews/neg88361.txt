my room on the floor was adjacent to an air conditioning heating unit that emitted a loud irritating humming noise all night when i opened the window hoping to let some of the sound escape there was another even larger unit in the courtyard making an even louder noise i expect some city noise traffic people but this was dreadful i left the next day because this was unacceptable and when you consider high cost of the room you do expect to be able to sleep
