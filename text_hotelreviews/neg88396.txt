we booked an executive double for nights and asked for a room in a quiet location either over the entrance cul de sac or one of the other courtyards but when we got there we found that the only room available at was a disabled room and even that wasn t available for another hour when we checked in there were or other couples also waiting for rooms the room was dismally dark with no lighting whatsoever in the sofa seating area and in addition the ensuite door would not close and its fan would not switch off when we complained they said maintenance would fix it but all they could achieve was the door they offered us a change of room the next day at by a timestamped letter left in the room but we had gone out for the day by then and it was way too late by the time we returned
