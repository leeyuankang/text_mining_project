asked for a room with a view and not a brick wall due to other reviews i had read got a room with no view a spiral emergency staircase with a wall behind it couldn t even see the sky and had to go downstairs to front door to do a weather check every morning couldn t open the blinds in case anyone was using the staircase and the windows wouldn t open so permanently in a darkish room very claustrophobic presume this is because we booked through booking com and got the room cheaper but it was still a night room only
