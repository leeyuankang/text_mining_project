the hotel charged phone calls i was sure we didn t make i called my roommate to verify and indeed she didn t call anybody we have been refunded straightaway however i was so curious and decided to call the phone number which they supposed we called and found out that it was their own restaurant i have previously contacted in internal call for reservation so make sure to verify your bill if you call the caxton grill even on internal call they might charge you
