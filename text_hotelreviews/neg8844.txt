they claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking they said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called grand royale and equally good but sent us off to shaftesbury hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night the second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room that hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast after much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the grand royale it appears that the grand royale london hyde park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel in my opinion they are confidence tricksters one guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason the hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms since i was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night they killed the joy and ruined our holiday
