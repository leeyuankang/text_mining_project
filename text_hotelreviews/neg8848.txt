we were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and i told them but never cleaned it the bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off
