my requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room i booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom
