the door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe the bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving up the side of the bed we had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this i refused to pay any extra as i couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms
