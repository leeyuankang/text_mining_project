the staff was rude the air blew cool the first night but warm the second night the temperature outside was not low enough for heat when my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit i didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money i paid the staff needs more training don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place
