when we arrive after a long day we were told that i had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room we informed we would have to pay for both rooms until i spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms but got sorted in the end also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads
