the walls are very thin and we were constantly disturbed by people walking past stomping in the room above at creaky floorboards and especially the group of people in the reception area until at least loudly having drinks i would have thought the hotel either would ask them to leave or have some way of containing the sound the hotel did give us a refund for the inconvenience but it ruined a good night s sleep my general feeling of the place was that although it sells itself as boutique and yes it s very well presented tidy clean and the staff were wonderful it just didn t have the quirkiness i imagined for a romantic weekend especially at that price it s a very expensive area too the room was awkwardly laid out in an l shape with a sharp corner jutting out right next to the bed this made it difficult to squeeze by with your suitcase and made it difficult and a bit annoying to get ready to go out the mirror above the desk dresser is placed too high my partner is average height and couldn t see her face properly in the mirror when doing her hair and makeup and this is the only place where she could plug in a hairdryer
