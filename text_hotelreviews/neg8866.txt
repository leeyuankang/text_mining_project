book the club room which didn t feel like one the first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held separate rooms the room was not well furnished despite the price paid one side of the mattress has collapsed i called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long before i could address the change of my room i was told that it was the last room and i can t make any changes i was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap when i came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night thank god for the curtains the room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint i was too tired and upset to even request for another room change
