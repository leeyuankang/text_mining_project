on our first evening which was a sunday and coincided with the election of the new french president who was about to party at the louvre right in front of our hotel we decided to have a quiet dinner in our lovely suite as most local restaurants appeared to be closed despite specifying clearly to room service on the phone that we wanted parmesan cheese with our pesto pasta and some bread to accompany the other fish dish which should in any case be normal practice it arrived without both the waiter had to go back and get them which meant that in the meantime our meal became rather cold which spoiled it somewhat the quality of the food was good however some of the restaurant bar staff need to be better trained we had lunch one hot day in the nearly empty bar and it took them around minutes just to bring us an iced tea while the bar girls appeared to be just chatting amongst themselves in the meantime
