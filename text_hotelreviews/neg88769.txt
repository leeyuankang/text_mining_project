we booked a junior suite and the size of the bedroom was very small it wasn t the same suite as shown on booking com at all we also requested a king size bed and we had two twin beds pushed together which then separated when we slept on it so my partner and i had to sleep on the twin beds with a gap between us due to falling down the gap it hurt my lower back we made a complaint on checking out and we are still waiting for the manager to come back to us
