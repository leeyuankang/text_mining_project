we had emailed the hotel of our late arrival so they knew we were travelling from the usa on a flight that was delayed for almost hours we were so were parched and when we got to our room we saw there was no water left out for us so we took one from the mini bar when we checked out i saw that they charged me euros for the water so excessive ridiculous really for a small bottle of water the next two nights they left bottled water for us on the nightstand
