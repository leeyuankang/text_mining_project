we selected to stay at the regina for our last four nights after a month stay in france we had high expectations since this is a star hotel but sadly we were extremely disappointed it was a really sad end to an otherwise amazing time in paris and france when we arrived the room was nice but in a very poor location there was no view and the noise level from the hotel staff was outrageous on one day we counted ten times hotel staff slammed doors outside our room there was constant noise from the hallway from staff and from outside our room with things clanging crashing we might have been near the hotel bar or restaurant it was not acceptable there was no hot water in the shower in our room when we arrived we called the front desk twice to get someone to look at it the night manager checked it and confirmed it was broken we were offered a smaller room on a lower floor in a less desirable location for the same price no less or wait until morning to have it fixed we thought the offer was pretty ridiculous so we opted to have it repaired in the morning we were told someone would arrive between to fix it no one showed up so at we called and someone finally showed up at about he got it to work but only minimally so we were not offered another room or any discount on our room the water was lukewarm at best with no water pressure whatsoever the staff were polite but very slow to respond we had to call four times to get towels and when they arrived at our room they did still did not have what we requested they constantly entered our room even when the light outside our room was red indicating we wanted privacy and did not want our room serviced when the green light indicating service was wanted no one showed up we had to call to request service we called to complain about the noise and the fact that the shower was still not functioning properly
