communication with regards to room service and breakfast choices were limited with room service but we were not advised of this on arrival or what the procedure was for breakfast one of the breakfast staff female was not friendly and did not make us feel welcome in the breakfast room which spolit it for us we had to ask for cutlery plates and a few of the items to be replenished which they did not do and breakfast on a sunday finishes at dead on the staff opened the hotpots turned them off and started clearing up this was not in my opinion very proffessional especially as we had already complained about lack of replenishing
