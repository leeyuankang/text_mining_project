we both drink english breakfast tea and the one teabag we received was never replaced over four days we found it a bit much that we were meant to pay for any extra teabags really petty and disappointing for a lovely hotel we also found the duvet far too hot and honestly never had a very good nights sleep i would suggest a sheet and easily washable light blanket much healthier and pleasant especially in summer
