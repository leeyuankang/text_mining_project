but after we left i receive a mail for later charge for mini bar i wrote back to the reception and asked them to clarify what i have taken from the mini bar but three days pasted there was no answer it is just euro and i can pay for the five star hotel suite also in term of honest i shall never deny my expense how could i deny this euro upon check out thus i think that is very impolite and rude for the hotel to charge me later and can not provide the facts which leads to a very bad experience
