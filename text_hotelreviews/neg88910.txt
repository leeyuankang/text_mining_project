i bought pairs of shoes empty boxes and one shoe remained in the bag the cleaner threw away the entire bag thinking it was rubbish but it included one new shoe the cleaner should have verified if this was rubbish management was very nice to reimburse me for the shoes and were sorry for the inconvenience
