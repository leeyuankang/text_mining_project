on arrival we were met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work they said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in mins an hour and half later we were still waiting i asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in they agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small tv didn t have a remote to operate it either it definatley was not a four star room or experience we had to que mins to get into the breakfast room when we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt they clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times worst hotel experience for us for a long time shame as we were there for my wife s birthday
