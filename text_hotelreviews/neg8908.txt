we were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel after explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in hyde park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal when we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card this meant that i was now down for a bill next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past all through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception i can safely say i do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main
