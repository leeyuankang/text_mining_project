when i arrived after days of travelling i was told that my room would only be ready in hours and that i should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale the rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had in london
