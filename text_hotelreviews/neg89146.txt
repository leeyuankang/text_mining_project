even though the room was prepaid the staff asked for my credit card fair enough as most hotels do this to guarantee payment for extras however mecure took euros from my account they said it was a preauthorisation and no money would be taken but it was not sure when the money will be refunded but very disappointed as it was part of my holiday money and leaves me short also be aware that you will pay bank commission charges won t use the hotel again ever
