not being able to sleep that s what i don t like it s am as i m writing this i thought it the room would cool down since i returned at and have had the window open there is no way of controlling the temperature in the room the ac is off as its winter and outside the air temp is about degrees c in the room its positively tropical still i can put up with noise coming from the street it a fusion of general road traffic people and train station related noise cars passing close by and the odd truck backing up people wandering past shouting and general saturday night drunks shouting if i could stop the hot air blowing into the room i could close the window and stop the noise i can t though even with the window open its still too hot anyway i ve spent years in the tropics so i m used to the heat i ve just had a cold shower and that s helped the last time i did this was in a hut on an island in the philippines i just rang the service quality the phone in my room directed me to the nice man told me that i was winter and cold outside so of course there s no ac i told him that it wasn t ac i needed really just no forced hot air that i can t stop i asked him if there was anything he could do as i was going to write a review and hopefully inform people who might want to avoid being transported to the tropics he said no nothing i m seriously considering leaving the room and sleeping in the train station next door with the homeless people i probably won t because i ve paid for breakfast and may have trouble getting that money back i m sure when temperatures are locally controllable and the windows can be shut this will e okay but so far i can only say okay as without wanting to sound like moaner there are other issues that may bother other people
