even though the room was fully prepayed they charged me additional euros at the arrival as it was explained it s in case i use anything additional during my stay and after my departure they will be returned to my bank account be careful it s euros for person for every night of your stay as of now it s been nearly three weeks and money still not returned to my bank account personally i am never again staying in another mercury hotel because of this policy and i honestly am scared to think what can happen if for example additional euros are blocked on my card for more than three weeks you can be left without any money during your trip if you are on budget the staff was very unhelpfull as money was blocked on the card without any normal explanation and even though i was talking before my stay via e mail with the hotel s reception aka do i need to pay anything else the asnwer was only breakfasts if you want them nowhere not on the booking com not on the hotel s website not anywhere is mentioned that they are blocking additional euros for each person for every night of your stay conclusion if you are a guest from out of france and on a budget trip do not stay here there are other hotels near this train station without any guarantee blockings it s more expensive than you think
