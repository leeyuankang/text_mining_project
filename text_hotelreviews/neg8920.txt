poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts i would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise the neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until we could hear everything clearly from the floor with the window closed narrow corridors difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom expensive breakfast so many good cafes in min walking distance
