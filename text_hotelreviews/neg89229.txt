our room was at the smoker floor and we are not smokers at all when i told that to the reception the guy told me yes normal because you did not mention in your booking reservation that you are not a smoker i find this simply amazing and i was completely not aware that this kind of practice reserving an entire floor for the smokers was still existing especially in paris the service and the rooms are clearly not at the level of a especially considering the price we pay for with the breakfast which was just ok
