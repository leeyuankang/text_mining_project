having received confirmation from booking com that i had booked a twin room i discovered on arrival that the room we were allocated was made up as a double when i asked for the beds to be split i was told we would have to move to another room this i did but i had to move my own bags despite by then being close to being late for a theatre matinee at no time was an apology offered for the nuisance and waste of time of this error or carelessness all i got was a bland multi purpose smile by the staff on reception
