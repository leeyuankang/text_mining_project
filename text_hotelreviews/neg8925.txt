i had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but i took a chance i had requested and early check in and we arrived very early upon arrival i was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me i quickly went into defense mode and told them that i had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it she called and told them i had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready they kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said i was high priority to get in our room we returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited while waiting i heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests i kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in we did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room club room was what it was called it was in the basement but clean and nice we had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit tea and hot chocolate upon checkout two of us left early and one remained i stopped at desk and said that one person remained and i wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything assured we were paid up when last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning she replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast we weren t charged the hotel made things right by my reservation but i am not sure i would stay again most of the staff was very nice and helpful
