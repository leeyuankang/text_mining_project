the rooms are too small its basically a star motel initially when we arrived we were informed of the non availabilty of double beds inspite of the fact that we specifically booked for double beds on the upper floors ahead of time imagine sleeping with a friend in a small bed after hours of travelling on the train we begged of course and they relented afterwards the bedframes were moving and we had a view of a ledge littered with cigarette butts of the first floor roof the hallway smells musty breakfast of euros is not worth it better take your breakfast someplace else
