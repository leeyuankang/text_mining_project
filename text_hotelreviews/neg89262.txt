the bedroom was very small in fact the smallest we have stayed in for a long time there were paper cups for coffee and a very basic bathroom even though this was said to be a superior room strangely there was a huge flat screen tv and a nespresso machine for coffee but we didn t use either of them there were insufficient staff at breakfast so tables were not cleared very fast and items on the breakfast bar not replaced quickly
