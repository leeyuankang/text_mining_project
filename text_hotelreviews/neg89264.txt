many thing i did not like among them the following they charged me euro per day as a guarantee though the hotel policy as shown in booking com says nothing about that the reception lady insisted to charge this ridicules amount the hotel did not pay attention to our special request and we had to wait for more than hrs to get our room the reception lady was so rude and informed us that the check in time is at and not as stated in booking com she blamed booking com for the inaccurate information upon our arrival to the room we were shocked by the miserable doubled bed we got two single beds closed to each other with out any joint when you sleep on this doubled bed it is very likely to fall down in the middle of the gab which would be created and the stuff has no respect to the guest privacy our room was crashed twice by the hotel stuff while we were resting there with out our permission the hotel does not look like a stars hotel it lacked any facility of which qualifies this property to be ranked as a stars hotel they have no porter
