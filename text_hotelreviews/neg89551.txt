i was stuck in the elevator for minutes until the rescue service arrives to the hotel i had to attend to a business meeting and i arrived one hour late a star hotel should have a faster rescue service trying to compensate this problem the hotel did not charge my breakfast in addition the hotel furniture was rather old and the double room actually was an small room at most with two beds and no space left for anything else in summary i would have expected more comfort and quality from a star hotel
