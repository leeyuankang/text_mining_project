when we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels minutes away the boiler had broken in the hotel they did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem they also had us sign a paper committing us to full night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move we were then transported at p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full night stay without inspection of the room or area at that hour we had no choice but to make the payment we were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a minute rail ride away we asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request we called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels we then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location around p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel although i was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an year old child the room was tiny much much smaller than most small european rooms worse yet it was filthy dirty the carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled the courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside we have pictures to support this description it was shocking that we were not released from the reservation we have used booking com in the past but never again they should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment
