they overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink i saw this because i dropped a soap the shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean i would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel i ve ever stayed at
