i couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road the entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out after a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall absolutely disgusted at our treatment
