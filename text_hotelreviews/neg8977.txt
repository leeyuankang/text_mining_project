on arrival i was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available although i asked for another room i was told there wasn t one that i would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard when i got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one i d paid for and was cheaper per night i asked to be transferred back to the hotel i d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic this all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time fridge would be handy
