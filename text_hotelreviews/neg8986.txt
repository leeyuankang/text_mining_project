to be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish we arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty my husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving we had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow i am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary
