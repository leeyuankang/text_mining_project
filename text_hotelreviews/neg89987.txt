it stated there was parking on website which was not correct and coming there unloading and checking in was harassed by the police for parking right in front by the door on private property he wanted to ticket us in a foreign car and when we tried to park on the street both meters on this actual street are broken and didnt work then upon departure again moved the car out front check out and load the bags in the car theres many since were on a long trip and the police put a ticket on our car the woman at the front desk went out to speak to them and it seemed pointless but she said they said to tear it up so she did but i do hope our rental car co in spain doesn t receive this ticket and we get charged for this so besides this and not having a luggage trolley everything inside the hotel was the best ever
