even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably no remediation possible toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests some were empty some partially used checkout at after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time having paid over for night stay this is somewhat disappointing service at breakfast was very poor shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done
