i did not quite realise the location was in the red light area but when a day later after i booked in march i tried to change i was refused my fault for not realising booking com regs but months in advance after only day booked i felt unfair parking was for nights so beware the rooms were set as a madames boudoir and a little on the shabby side fortunately my sons aged saw the funny side beds comfortable enough and rooms cool staff english speaking and friendly
