due to the nature of the area there were one or two less savoury characters floating about it s also quite noisey at night we were woken up by voices on the street in the rooms the lamp shades were flimsy paper mache the edge of the desk was peeling breaking off and there were splatters on the material wall paper probably nothing sinister i think it s quite difficult to clean material walls and is probably remembrance of a good night out i d say it s more of a star hotel than star to be honest the wifi could only connect if we sat on the corner of the bath definitely wasn t available throughout the room
