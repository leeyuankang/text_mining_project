approaching the hotel from pigalle metro station you see a large sign saying villa royale atop a building and a few doors at the bottom of that building directly below the sign as i went into those doors i am told that this is not the hotel just a cafe the actual entrance to the hotel is around the corner opening the door to the hotel which is a very heavy door there is no immediate sign of reception just some chairs and paintings i had no idea where to go until a worker walked past and took me to the reception a tiny thing not bigger than a schooldesk i checked in fine but i was rather surprised that every single time i leave the hotel i have to give the key back to the reception staff and they will give it back to me upon my return after coming back from a days activities i go to reception to get my key back from a person i had not met before and all i had to do was say the room number and he gave me the key to the room this begs the question of could anyone saunter into that hotel and ask for any room key and they d get it there were literally no checks and this made me a tiny bit worried about my belongings when i was out and about no complaints about the room but if you want to be extra picky it was a small gap between the bed and the wardrobe so for people who are slightly larger it may prove a problem also one of the wardrobe doors opens less than halfway because of the bed
