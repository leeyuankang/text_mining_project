the location was both good and bad right next to pigalle sex shops and a large nightclub also lots of traffic night i slept great but the next i had to put in earplugs the windows do block out a lot of noise but you will still notice the area is very lively and noisy especially if you are not used to it at home a few little detals that would maybe improve the total impression of the hotel like a few missing buttons in the elevator velvet wall that could be replaced deposit upon arrival of maybe it s just in case there are damages to the room not sure either way i don t understand why we have to pay a deposit upon arrival since the room has already been paid for by credit card non refundable on booking com
