they stuck us in the basement for for nights they could not give us at least first floor the wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week i could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day the desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything i had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi they advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising cost pounds to get to the airport all they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby the women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the usa forgetaboutit
