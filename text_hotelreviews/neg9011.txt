the room was supposed to be a superior double room it wasn t at all the window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned you could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed for this price not including breakfast the hotel was very unsatisfactory a terrible cheek i would definitely want some money back i would never go to this hotel again they are cheats
