they blocked euros on credit card at check in which was more than the cost of our stay then they charged the cost of stay in addition to the blocked amount it s been two days since check out and they still haven t unblocked this amount today we called the property and we had great difficulty getting the staff to understand and acknowledge the problem they were unhelpful and showed no interest in solving our problem what they said was something along the lines of this is how we operate we cannot say when we will unblock it it will be at least a few weeks we will definitely be avoiding this hotel chain in the future
