reception staff are friendly and helpful but cleaning staff are not all surfaces in our room had dust for the entire stay we didn t complain waiting to see when it would be cleaned we even drew a line on the dust to be visible it was never cleaned and the cleaning staff were just rude whenever we would sleep in and put the do not disturb sign they would vacuum our threshold banging the vacuum cleaner onto our door for mins just so that they finish all the cleaning at am the handy smartphone they give is horrible it s slow works half the time and has a short battery life hours or so with usage or attempt at usage to be accurate
