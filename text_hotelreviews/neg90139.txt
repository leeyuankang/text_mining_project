a few suggestions to improve the bathroom from being more form over substance if you want your guests to recycle the bath towels for being kind to the environment please at least provide towel hooks for hanging the used towels the water pressure for the shower is not strong enough hence it takes a long time to wash my hair the floor should be heated as the small radiator is not effective at all the wash basin is made of wrong material which slows the flow of the water and resulted residuals constantly left behind which is extremely unpleasant
