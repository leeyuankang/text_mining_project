for the price of for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when i complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast also the photos of a superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed there is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed we won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money i will go with the budget option next time
