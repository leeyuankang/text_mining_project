the so called superior double room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated club room and not a superior room also we checked in at hr and returned at hr to be told that there was a minimum of a hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available we also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered
