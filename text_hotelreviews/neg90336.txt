the abruptness of some of the breakfast staff some of the serving staff were very helpful and kind the front of house however was quite rude in her approach the area around the hotel doesn t feel particularly safe with a young child there were quote a few homeless people taking refuge beside the entrance and to the right of the hotel on the steps between the main train station and the hotel entrance it put me on edge a little and the smells were fairly unpleasant
