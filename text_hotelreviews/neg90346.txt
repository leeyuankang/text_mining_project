initially the window in our room opened without a catch or lock and our toddler could very easily have fallen out the sofa was just below it so easy to climb up to it they moved us to another room though when we raised this concern also and no fault of the hotel unfortunately the square outside the hotel seems to be used by homeless people drinking so it often stank and was pretty unsavoury to walk through not unsafe particularly but unhygienic
