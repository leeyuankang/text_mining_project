i would love to see some sort of service whereby travellers heading to gare de lyon with heavy bags especially older women like myself could avail themselves of a porter or some help to get from the hotel to the train station as it is difficult to manage luggage along the street and up stairs etc perhaps a porter service that could be booked on line at the time of the hotel reservation just a thought
