first of all i should say that i m a genius member of booking com and in the hotel s features i read that they offer hours early and late check in and check out respectively but when i arrived to hotel and i was extremely exhausted they told me they do not know any thing about it and i stayed almost hours in lobby for my room secondly i paid cash and i paid all the price of the hotel in check in and they took a guaranty fee as usual but i was in other hotels also parisian hotels and i m aware of guaranty fee they charged me for nights rooms it s so much thirdly the reception forgot to give me back my exchange money times and always i was like i think you should give me moreover the range of breakfast options was not too much compared to the hotel s stars generally speaking i was in at least novotel hotels but it s the worst
