we paid extra to get an executive room with that came with a coffee pod machine and free mini bar i was looking forward after a long day of travelling to check into the room and have a couple of relaxing drinks once in the room i find the mini bar consists of one small can of warm beer fridge dosnt get turned on until after you enter the room a few waters and a couple of soft drinks no other alcohol besides the warm beer so i got the warm beer and the wife had a glass of warm water we were disapointed there was enough milk for coffee each and you had to drink that out of a cheap little plastic disposable cup executive room my ass we have stayed in cheap hotels in the past but they at least had a coffee glass ceramic cup bed was very hard and uncomfortable not worth the money
