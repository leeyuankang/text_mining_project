not a safe place to stay because the hotel is next to the train station a lot of interested characters hang around the hotel we also saw them walking trough the hotel and looking around at night and security guy didn t do nothing about it when you walk out the hotel in the morning the whole area stinks of urine it was discussing also there was an incident while we were there which could of been avoided if the staff listen when we told them about it near the kids game room there was a guy acting strange and he had a bag full of medication we are talking a big clear garbage bag we told the staff about it and the response was ahh yeah we know about him he paid for his room earlier today but he still hasn t gone up to his room we might give him his money back and ask him to leave when we reported this it was around nothing was done but then the guy started popping pills down his throat and sniffing what ever drugs he had he also started taking his clothes of immediately we informed the staff what is happening and then they decided to take him to his room not long after that we heard screaming but then it stop we knew it was him later when we returned to our room at midnight we heard screaming again but this time it was a female screaming and calling for help because it was so close to our room we opened the door to see what it is going on and we saw him coming out a room with no clothes on just in his underwear his face was all bruised we called reception and asked for help after we noticed that there were more people out of their rooms we got out of our room to see what is going on it turns out that the same guy was out of his room and obviously under the influence of drugs wondering around until a lady came out of the lift and he followed her to the room where she was going and forced his way in
