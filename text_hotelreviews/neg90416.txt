i booked this hotel months before my arrival i saw that there is an option to bring one child under years old with no extra cost the option is still mentioned on booking website i mentioned on the invitation that we are a family of since we booked a room for and i would like to use the option to have kids using the existing bed set exactly what is mentioned on the hotel page on booking com we arrived on in the morning and the staff was not willing to give me a key unless i will pay for extra room double cost i told them that the kids are sleeping and they asked them to give me at least the key for the first room that i ve already paid just to send them to sleep and we can continue the conversation but they said no way and there is a clear message from the manager that i need to pay for extra room before i can use the first room i felt like a hostage and at the end i gave them my credit card just to be able to send my kids to sleep the staff also mentioned that they told booking that i cannot get a room and booking told them that it s ok but no one informed me they both forgot the customer till now neither the hotel or booking provided me the name or time that they informed me about that i m still shocked from the bad service that i got from both the staff and manager that didn t have me any solution and just want my money on top of all that they room was prepaid and they didn t gave me any option for refund super bad service which made the overall experience bad
