the pool was freezing i mean freezing my son wouldn t get in and the changing rooms had dirty towels dumped all over them also being right next to the lobby means you have to go to the pool in your shorts and walk past everyone checking in the room staff were friendly but they were very keen to have us out of the rooms by to clean them the car park is not for the faint of heart as it s a tricky ride in and is expensive but after all this the location is awful you walk out to the street where the tramps relieve themselves it stinks and is at the other end of paris from the majority of the attractions eiffel tower away for example yes it s a novotel but it is pricey for what it is
