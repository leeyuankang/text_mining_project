the room was very small for a double the bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed there was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use the bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it this should not be classed as a star hotel in my opinion the reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests
