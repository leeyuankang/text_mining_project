had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable
