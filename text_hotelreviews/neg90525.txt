when i booked the hotel with booking com in the house rules section it stated that up to children can stay free of charge when using existing bedding i have booked a room with a queen bed and sofa bed upon check in with my family of adults children i was told that there is a maximum of persons for the booked room even though during the booking process there was no selection for another room type i was forced into getting an additional room for nights even though i had a printed page of the house rules stating up to children stay free of charge when using existing bedding i have stayed in numerous novotel hotels around the world and have never had a problem when checking in as it has always stated that up to children stay free of charge when using existing bedding booking com have since changed their house rules for this hotel which makes it even worse in general the hotel was good but the issue with having to pay for an additional room for nights have left a very bad taste in my mouth i would certainly think again about using novotel in the future after this
