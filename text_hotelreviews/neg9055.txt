on the day we were to check in i missed a call at letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in paddington for our entire stay having googled this boiler issue i found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler upon arrival at the hotel i was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel i asked if there was a member of management i could speak to about this matter i expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that i had chosen to stay i also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that i had found i was told that this was just something that happened to the hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time after causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest however i was happy that my original booking had then been honoured
