booked rooms double deluxe room had obviously had smokers in next room damp then settled for last room very small not sure where deluxe was also booked other deluxe double rooms which were allocated to our colleagues when we arrived as they informed us of room numbers when colleagues arrived their rooms apparently had no hot water then rooms were locked and then had been given to other people they ended up in tiny single rooms not what we paid for they made us late for a very important appointment it seemed like this group of hotels were shipping people in and out of sister hotels not at all happy
