that is possibly the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel and i have stayed in a few and we were upgraded to a larger room i really didn t think you could cram a shower bath and toilet and basin into but they managed it it was nice and clean but it was absolutely tiny and given the cost isn t cheap it is a big let down from the main part of the hotel
