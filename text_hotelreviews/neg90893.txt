it says it s a star hotel but it feels more like a stars the rooms are tiny the to had no brush trash can and no isolation cold and loud all the time the shower door didn t fit so i couldn t close it there was only a small plastic shower gel the rooms were extremely loud to the point we thought people were trying to enter our room when guests would go back to the rooms next door the bed and overall space was very small
