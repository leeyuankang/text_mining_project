the main elevator was out of service we had to use the very small elevator we stayed on level and we had to climb up the stairs due to the back up elevator only served to the floor in the email we were informed that we would be given free soft drinks but we got only items instead until my first check out one of the male staff needed to be more friendly and he was a bit defensive when i asked him politely about my inconvenience his answer was ok but the way he answered was not ok
