the restaurant service and food at the breakfast and when we had a late lunch were below average the room had no charm or character it smelled like mold there was the metro noise that was heard all the time the wifi coverage was bad and kept on getting cut the a c did not work and they had to send someone to fix it twice the carpets are ugly in stairs and corridors of the hotel the bathroom is really old and of cheap quality the hotel is large and impersonal it is a three star hotel in a building that once hosted a grand hotel no coffee in the room no extra amenities or personal touch
