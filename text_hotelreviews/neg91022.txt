closet area was rather small and had to ask for rolling rack with additional hangers but we did a huge amount of shopping king bed took up most of the room but not unlike any other hotel rooms could be updated a bit better however bookings com really screwed up we extended our stay bookings com said they made the airline changes and they billed us but never made changes with the airline hours before flight we had to contact airline directly and on the phone for hours bookings com wouldn t take care of the problem expeditiously had to repay for premier class seats with the airline but we did get reimbursed later bookings com has a lot to learn about customer service in an urgent situation
