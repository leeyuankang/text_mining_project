the only thing that i felt was a little overrated was the restaurant downstairs cafe de la paix i ordered a medium steak and it came our tough and still purple and it came with a brick of the driest potato au gratin ever it was awful there are many amazing places to eat in the area i recommend walking through this restaurant but saving your money and eating somewhere else
