the building was built in the s and it is well maintained the metro is extremely close however i believe that being an intercontinental hotel there is no harm in combining the existing nice old architecture with some modern amenities to be more specific the rooms are spacious but they need some modernisation for example the doors and windows should be changed in the bathroom the shower should be also replaced with some modern mixer taps the water pressure in the shower is very poor the hot cold water mixing isn t functioning properly the vanity unit is poor the toilette is spacious but there are no bidets as for the cabinet inside the room during our stay one of the cabinet doors fell down luckily my elder son years was opening it and not my younger years old son anyway we called the reception and they strongly apologised and fixed it we even received an apology letter from the guest relations and also a complementary basket of fruits but again it could have been dangerous anyway as i rated the staff earlier in general they are extremely friendly and very helpful hence i hope that the management of the hotel takes my constructive remarks into consideration because as i mentioned before the hotel has really a great location and very nice and helpful staff
