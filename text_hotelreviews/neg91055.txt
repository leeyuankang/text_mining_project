caf de la paix refused to accommodate us on sunday at because the staff had screened off one small section of the restaurant to serve and could not be bothered to serve the two of us hotel guests anywhere else in the huge premises they were very rude with the exception of the waiter i first asked for help who ran up and down asking his manager and those running the caf at the door for help everyone let him down i had to walk off in the end i chose the hotel partly to try caf de la paix on the grounds that it was open all day and was very disappointed reception gave us a billing room number after checkout time so we could settle our account in one go around but the waiter in the wintergarden taking the bill would not listen to me and said this was not a room number i told him to check with reception but he was rude and did not apologise
