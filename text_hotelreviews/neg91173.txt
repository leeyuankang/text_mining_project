the only negative i can pick out about the hotel is that during our stay the hotel was having a lot of work done this was not mentioned prior to booking the hotel this meant most days there was a lot of noise being made by diy men who were carrying out work on the hotel and even meant access to the lift was cut off for a short period of time also the view from our room window was pointless because of scaffolding being in the way upon checking out from the hotel on our last day we arrived in reception to see the whole of the walls and ceiling being ripped out and re done as well for such a nice hotel it seemed that it was either brand new and not finished or having a lot of refurbishment done this however was the only negative
