booking com mentioned the room was but for some reasons i was given a room in the corner and it s not when i mentioned it i was offered to change to another room but since i had unpacked already i could not be bothered i paid the price for this room because i needed a bigger room i find it odd that without any mentioning i m just given a smaller room also the hotel was under renovation which was not clearly stated in booking com
