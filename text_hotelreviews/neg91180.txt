we had been told the roof terrasse was closed due to renovation but not that the space on floor were regular occupied by workers who made rather much noise from am to pm every day considering thar the hotel was hardly filled we could not understand why the hotal had placed us at this upper floor as close as possible to the workers and the noise wonder if this was why we had booked via booking com cannot refrain from thinking that the hotel range us different from their direct customers despite we even had a h honor membercard in hand rgs jens
