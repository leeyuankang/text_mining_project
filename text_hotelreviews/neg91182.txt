i didn t like the hidden charge for breakfast off the menu the room was booked as a gift to include breakfast but when booking it wasn t clear that breakfast only included the buffet and that anything off the menu was chargeable also as the roof terrace was a selling point we were a little disappointed that it was closed for refurbishment
