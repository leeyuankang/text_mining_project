the trendy cosmopolitan styling wasn t really to my liking its a bit edgy and dynamic with its podium concierge desk and open plan nightclub type hotel bar area i really prefer a hotel to be more relaxing comfortable and homely a bit overpriced compared to comparable hotels in the same area i would stay there again but it wouldn t be my first choice
