reception staff were rude and not very helpful there were renovations were happening which we weren t warned about prior to our stay and we were woken sunday morning by drilling we paid for breakfast only to be told we had only got continental and had to pay a supplement for anything hot we tried to have a drink in the bar only to be ignored by a flirtatious barman who was more interested in giving cocktail lessons to a group of ladies overall really not worth the hefty price tag
