very deceptive there was no spa or gym facilities and the beautiful roof terrace bar which features in all the pictures and was the main reason we chose this hotel was closed for renovations but it never said this there seemed to be a lot of hoarding up inside the hotel for building renovation work ongoing i feel hotels should have to let you know when there is work ongoing as it s a real turn off when going for a leisure break away from the madness of every day life
