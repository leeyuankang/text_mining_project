as regulars at this hotel we were highly embarrassed when we recently stayed with family at the hotel we had bragged that the hotel was a fantastic find which they were all going to love how wrong rooms weren t allocated among our party correctly far too expensive for size and standard of rooms hotel needs a refurb rooms are shabby breakfast wasn t to normal standard cheap produce we had mentioned it was my mum s and so they kindly left birthday chocolates in one of the rooms but it the wrong room surely its the hotels job to know which guests are in which rooms we had hoped for views over the square like we normally have but only one room could see a glimpse and to top it off our bathroom floor flooded as the shower doesn t have a suitable draining system considering we are regulars at the hotel and we booked well in advance i had expected a lot more we certainly would t even entertain the thought of staying here again don t book keep looking there are far superior hotels in london
