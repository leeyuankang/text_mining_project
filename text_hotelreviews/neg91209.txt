value for money way off even though it was a great price for the location it was still per night and for that amount of money i expect at least not to hear my next door neighbours chatting at oclock at night they were not shouting or arguing but the sound insulation of my room was worse than the one you find at a chicken shed i suppose i expect a bathroom finished to good standard a socket to charge my phone close to bed and working wifi wifi was actually not working for most of the time and when it did it was too slow bathroom was poorly finished with damaged tiles poorly repaired as well and plastic part of toilet seat partially broken not what you expect from a hotel with hilton as part of its name disappointed with the room i assume it does not reflect the image of the rest of the hotel but i did not get a lot for my weekend accommodation i have stayed at much better rooms costing of this one
