internet service was extremely frustrating as it kept kicking in and out during entire stay when i found out i could have booked for over less a night i was subjected to a barrage of mumbo jumbo well practiced to confuse and frustrate few of the staff if any are native english speaking which added to the confusion the roof top viewing area was closed which was not known until arrival all in all there is no good reason to stay there as i feel it lacks too much that you want in a visit to england
