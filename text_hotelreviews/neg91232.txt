i didn t think the room was good value for money i paid for a room with no view its all very well charging for the location but if the guest can t see the reason for the location i think that should be reflected in the price the walls were lined with the wires for the light fittings but there was absolutely no attempt to make them blend in which made the decor very ugly the television had basic freeview i have stayed in cheaper places that offer sky at the very least the bathroom was lovely apart for the fact that the sink was enormous so it took ages to fill
