the v bar is a different company and they refused to bring a coffee up from the main hotel i pay money for the hotel and i am happy to pay for a cup of coffee i was expected to fetch my own coffee down to the main concourse and then up in the lifts not what i would expect from a hilton hotel music in v bar and the lifts repetitive and too modern for clientele v bar prices very inflated even for london also booking com should make it clear on internet bookings that your head office is in china a lot of confusion was caused at booking in due to t he fact that my address was down as a chinese mansion staff not very good at dealing with this issue
