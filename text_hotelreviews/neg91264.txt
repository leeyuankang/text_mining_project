i ve stayed in this hotel several times during about years and i loved it earlier it was my favorite in london unfortunately i have to say that they are just not trying anymore some things are starting to look and feel like in a star hotel the hotel is still nice but not worth the money anymore wifi is a joke it basically does not function at all
