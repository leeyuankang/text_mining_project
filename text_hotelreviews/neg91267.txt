the hotel had a facade of scaffold and sheeting meaning the room felt dark with no view from the window the much advertised roof top bar was closed and we were not informed of any of this at the time of booking our room had a adjoining door that had no sound proofing and we could hear the guys next door clearly giggling and chatting the bar area was dark and felt dull with no atmosphere at all its such a shame for what should be a lovely looking hotel it was poor however i guess this was all mostly due to the referbishment works
