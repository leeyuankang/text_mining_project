i booked as a surprise gift for my my daughter and her partner for one night what clinched the decision to book at the trafalgar was the view from the rooftop garden most disappointed when me daughter told me it was closed this really should have been mentioned on website unless i missed it which is quite possible otherwise everything ok thank you
