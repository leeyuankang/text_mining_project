staff that don t speak english well seems to be the trend in london that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms had a room on fl which is reached via elevator to the and then a snakey passage with steps anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic the closet so small that days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries those we had to lay on the suitcase rest the desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner it could have used a mini fridge underneath the last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed these were beds smaller than a double and hard as rock i ordered an extra comforter to place on top it helped somewhat
