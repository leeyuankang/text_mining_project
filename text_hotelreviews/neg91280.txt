i didn t like the fact that when we booked we wasn t informed that the whole building was covered in scaffolding and white sheets this meant that the view from our first room of trafalgar square was blocked and we just looked at scaffolding would have been nice to have been told when we booked as the whole reason we booked was for the lovely views and the roof top bar which may i add was out of use too
