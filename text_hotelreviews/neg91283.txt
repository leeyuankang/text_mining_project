initially we couldn t find the hotel and then realised its because it was the one covered up in scaffolding boarding and plastic sheeting meaning the kerb appeal was gone whilst i understand the need for improvements to be made it would have been nice if perhaps the hotel could have called or emailed us just to let us know about the works so we were at the very least expecting them down points were no view because of the scaffolding and we couldn t open the window for fresh air on our arrival day everything was clean but on day the maid must have been having an off day as dirty glasses and cups were not swapped coffee was not refilled bed was made up but not very well and bathroom sink had not been wiped around we had mornings worth of breakfasts there was a good choice on all days but only was great day the scrambled eggs were chalky and lacked taste day i was waiting minutes for my poached eggs and bacon when it still hasn t arrived i went to the chef to check he hadn t forgotten he told me he had done them and given them to me i think i would have remembered eating my breakfast another disappointment was regarding the vista bar with the great view this to me was the selling point of the hotel and it was the wonderful photos showing the bar that made me book i booked through booking com and paid immediately with no refund option so imagine my disappointment when i checked the reviews on trip advisor early january to see it was closed for winter really the pictures should not be used to advertise this and there should certainly be a warning on all the sites they sell through that this is a seasonal bar
