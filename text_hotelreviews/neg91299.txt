although i was a single business traveler i was put in a room with an interconnecting door to a family with small children this was not sound proofed and i could not work due to the noise at night i was woken up by the father snoring the bed was uncomfortable hairs in around the sink heating aircon sounded like an aircraft taking off this was the worst hotel room i have stayed in for years and i managed very little sleep
