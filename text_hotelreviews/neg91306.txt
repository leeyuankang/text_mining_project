this hotel is obviously focused on the downstairs bar and roof terrace bar not staying guests as a result of the bar the reception is squeezed in the hallway anyone off the street going to the roof bar can access the room areas and as we found out set off fire alarms at midnight hallways are very dark including breakfast area when you want it bright and airy no breakfast in room option no cooked breakfast and a condescending message as to why not message we are managing you and have decided you ll eat healthy no ventilation in rooms so big smell of damp furniture smelled of wet dogs moved rooms and the same after air freshener had worn off great staff and location but terrible hotel for a night
