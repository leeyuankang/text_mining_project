the room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk the windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room moreover the air con didn t heat the room either the furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere the shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel i don t understand why people rate it so high i will not come back definitely not stars in my opinion
