i specifically booked this hotel for the vista bar on the first day we sent our food back and on the night the power went off to the heaters so we couldn t stay on our second day they closed it at for a private party of which we were not informed when i challenged this with hotel management they stated it is a destination bar and not owned by the hilton this is not the impression they give on the website and use is as a marketing tool overall extremely disappointed in the reaction of the staff and the service in the main bar a waiter spilled a glass of wine which resulted in a small measure he served it anyway without topping it up not good
