the only hotel on my trip through europe and uk that did not provide free wifi i pointed out to the girl on reception it was advertised as free wifi on booking com and she very reluctantly gave me a password to use in the downstairs bar area only but she was not very nuce about it at all my room also overlooked the office block very close next door so i could not open the curtains in my room for privacy reasons
