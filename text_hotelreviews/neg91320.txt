we booked this hotel for the rooftop bar expecting a nice chilled drink looking over the square we went up before going to bed only to be met with a private party in section of roof with a view then were sat in middle of roof with no view at all drinks also seemed overly expensive which i wouldn t have minded had we had a decent view it all seemed very pretentious and not what we expected at all
