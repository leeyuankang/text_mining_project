well given it wasn t the hotel i booked i can t really say much about it despite having booked days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy i was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in london hotels i realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms it happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that i stay in
