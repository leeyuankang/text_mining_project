the condition of the hotel fell far far below four star class and i m amazed they ve retained this rating if they have the corridors were tired with door frames marked by years of trollies banging into them the room was blessed with a noisy antiquated air conditioner dirty wall a carpet with scorch marks from an iron and a small double with an old mattress not worth the money even in such a good location
