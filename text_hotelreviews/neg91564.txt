hotel lobby is reasonably clean and well maintained but the hotel corridors look shabby and the rooms a bit tired the carpet in our room was not in good condition the bed was very uncomfortable as were the pillows the curtain was so thin it let in all the light with sunrise at am this meant a very early wake up a renovation of the hotel interiors is overdue
