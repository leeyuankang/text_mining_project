the hotel is in need of an over haul we knew not to expect too much from this hotel having read previous reviews and chose this hotel based on price and location if you can over look the following you can manage to stay here windows required two of us to try and open we managed space for fresh air curtain will open with some difficulty toilet often times required flushes to work we mentioned this to staff and it didn t come as a surprise we did require help turning on tv as they are set up strangely and require you push numbers into remote to work staff kindly came to room to help but could have easily been avoided with instructions for guests woodwork is damaged throughout the hotel the bed was soft for my liking we had just come from differing places in paris where the beds were very comfortable this may be a matter of taste seemed to be dust dirt build up around the edges of room
