staff were harassed poorly trained and grumpy with only one notable exception i asked for a strong coffee in the morning this was refused twice and when i asked again if it may be possible to have a stronger coffee the coffee served was the colour of weak tea the waitress brought me a sachet of nescafe and told me i could tip it into the cup the evening receptionist was too busy slamming down telephones and was extremely harassed and angry when i arrived the morning receptionist made up for it by being very understanding and arranging for a refund for my breakfast
