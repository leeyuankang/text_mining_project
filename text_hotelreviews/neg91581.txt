not customer oriented very bad service ordered some room service the bar called me later on to say that my card wasn t pre authorized and therefore i had to prepare some cash upon explaining that no one asked me to pre authorize my card and that i didn t have any cash left they replied that i should come down to pay with my card and hang up on me i needed a pair of scissors but no one at reception or at the bar would have one to lend i emailed to enquire whether i could check in earlier but no one ever reply back
