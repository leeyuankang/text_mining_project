when we arrived for breakfast the restaurant was full they asked us to wait and then sat people that arrived after us first there was no consideration when we sat down for the full english breakfast there was no bacon no scrambled eggs no fried eggs no hash brown the only thing that they had in plenty was mushrooms and tomatoes the staff were not organised and were rude at breakfast which was a shame as all the other staff were very pleasant
