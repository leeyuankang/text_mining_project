we had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure this was true as soon as we arrived they tried to do it i needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took minutes in giving as a room i think this is not very professional my husband also confirmed months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it we also ask for an additional blanket on sunday and we needed to call twice to front desk in order they brought it we had it after almost hour
