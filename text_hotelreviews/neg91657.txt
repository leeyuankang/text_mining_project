the hot water system had broken down and we had no hot water in our room for the duration of our stay therefore no baths or showers taken the staff were very apologetic and gave us a discount on our booking apparently the hotel were waiting for a part for the boiler nobody mentioned this to us when we checked in it only came to light when we complained the hotel would benefit from a refurbishment
