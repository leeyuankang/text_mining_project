thought it would be a real treat to stay there but it wasnt excellent location but a tired looking place needs updating and a good clean the lifts were scruffy and curtains were hanging off the rail in reception not a good welcome the toilet in the room was without windows or fan so you could just smell the loo the whole time heating not working so a small portable radiator was placed there just disappointed i would never stay there again cost a lot of money spend your money elsewhere
