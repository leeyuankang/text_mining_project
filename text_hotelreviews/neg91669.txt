the staff on the evening when we had something to eat was a bit frosty when ordering our food the hotel is nice just it s appearance could do with being updated the room was pleasant the plunger in the sink wasn t working so we reported that breakfast room was small we didn t feel comfortable as everyone was very close when sitting at a table reception area was also used for breakfast
