the room had been cleaned but was old musty and still felt dirty shabby the bathroom was shambolic you had to climb over the toilet which didn t flush adequately to get into the shower a large person would not have been able to do this the sink water did not run away for ages and you could not pop up the plug sufficiently at breakfast the staff only were so overworked and they ran out of clean cups not their finest hour
