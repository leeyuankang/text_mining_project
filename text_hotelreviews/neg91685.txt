it needs refurbishment now without heating in london with degrees was problem i got cold and two days i am out of the office they had a small additional rediator just to mention that i had an oil to apply for my moist ache and when i tried it was frozen like a cream this is unecceptable if they new that they have problem they should change our room if was general they should supply all rooms with bigger this is an excuse especially when you stay one night i asked the lady and she said they had problem so i do not care i could say the same that i have problem and i cannot pay them the heating is the most important next step is to claim my money from booking and i will do that
