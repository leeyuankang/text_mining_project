i must have been given one of the older rooms which needed refurbishment room on entering the room i noticed a portable electric heater which should have rang alarm bells i didn t have time to speak to reception to ask for another room as i had to depart quickly for an evening function once back to the hotel and during my sleep i awoke feeling cold and had to put an extra blanket on the bed even with the electric heater on full the room was freezing the bathroom extract fan was so powerful and noisy it was pulling high volumes of cold air through the leaky window adjacent to the bed making it draughty the repeated noise of the nearby lift through the early hours didn t help either poor hot water pressure and flow in the bathroom topped off the experience other than that the staff were friendly and breakfast was good avoid room if you re offered it
