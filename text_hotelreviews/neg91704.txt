the room was small and had received what must of been a very basic clean so it was quite dirty in the corners and dusty throughout generally very old decor greatly in need of investment to update it odd perfumed scent attempted to mask the old smell in the room when we first walked in the heating didn t work properly so they had a little heater on full blast when we arrived it must of been running all day as the room was like a sauna the mattress was unbelievable uncomfortable with broken springs in places the bedding was clean but didn t smell fresh like they d been through a very hot wash thousands of times but never replaced all in all a hotel where the staff are great but let down hugely by lack of investment and proper cleaning
