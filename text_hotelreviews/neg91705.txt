this was not a hotel as advertised although clean the rooms were a joke to stay in a very cramped dated not centrally heated room is ridiculous furniture is strained and battered plug sockets are un useable being located so low to counter tops not leaving enough space for cables we had to unplug our only heater to charge phones leaving the room freezing i would give this hotel a star max and wouldnt pay more than per night
