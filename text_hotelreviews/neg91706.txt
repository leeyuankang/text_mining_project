a we had to change our room times before we got one that was even close to being habitable b first room carpet torn and heavily stained the bed linen appeared to have been used before c bedroom the mattress was old and the edges were only deep and broken down it was also very stained with blood and bodily fluids no proper mattress protector and the four pillows were thin and old d throughout our stay we spoke to the head of housekeeping a number of times regarding the quality of the rooms and she informed us that almost all the rooms were in this condition it was only thanks to her intervention that we finally were moved to a room that was satisfactory e the hotel was tatty and run down in appearance our understanding from your website that this hotel has a star rating sadly this is not the case f since we selected this hotel on the basis that we were booking star accommodation we are prepared to pay the full price for the two nights where the room was satisfactory however we feel that a full refund for the three previous nights would be appropriate g the above were the main issues more listed below duvets wafer thin odd cups chipped bathrobe one for people unfinished furniture in room no doors on armoire all paintwork chipped and damaged peeling wallpaper etc etc photographs are available if required we look forward to your early response john and jan summerfield
