what didnt we like most things to start with beds were by far the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept in it felt as if it was falling apart and for that reason very noisey both myself and colleague shared a twin room heating was broken freezing cold night only working plugs in the room how are business people meant to work carpets were really dirty also which is very off putting huge draft through the window made our night totally horrific it was freezing made sense why there was a portable heater in the room which was useless pillows were falling apart i had to sleep my head on a blanket we were also awoken to the bin men right outside our window at am for a solid minutes for cheaper i could have stayed at the millenium hotel just down the road which is by far much more superior and also much better value for money its not even a cheap hotel to warrant having such bad qualities
