we had a fuse blow in the room causing the lighting to fail completely apart from socket lighting we phoned reception and some mins later a porter arrived with a light bulb he realised it was the fuse problem saying he could not do it we were left to get ready with no lighting which consisted of showering then hair drying and makeup to be done hence no one returned to fix the fuse i reported it once again to reception when booking out of hotel to which she replied she would get someone to look at it to which i replied well that s not going to help us now is it
