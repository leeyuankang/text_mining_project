xmas tree looked awrful walking down park lane at other hotels there trees were gorgeous don t think it would have coat to much to have a really nice xmas tree in reception would have made such a difference only other point was the staff from the hilton hotel at night they seems to use the area at the front of your hotel to have a smoke and a chat it goes no on and off throughout the night emptying the bins was not really a problem but did wake us up
