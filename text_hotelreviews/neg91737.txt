the hotel was lovely and the staff extremely friendly and helpful the only thing that let it down was the fact the the room was very tired and desperately in need of work there were marks on the wallpaper the skirting boards were completely covered with scrapes and very large scratches and the lamp shades were badly damaged with holes and rips in nearly all of them everything else about our stay and the hotel was wonderful
