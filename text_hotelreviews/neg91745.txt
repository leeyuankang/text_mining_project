the hotel is completely run down and booking com should have had something of note on this fact displayed on the listing i booked the most expensive room on the site there were available at time i booked i went most expensive because the picture and description let me believe it was the best room at the hotel very far from it the room was a dump it was very old and dingy what pissed me off was that i was charged when for more i could have stayed at the hilton in a better room management absolutely would not adjust my pricing to reflect the standard dumpy room rate of instead they offered to move me to a bigger room which i agreed to and they did natalie the manager on duty at the time could not have been more professional she did her best to reason with me and to liaise with their corporate office natalie was a star my recommendation don t stay at this hotel seriously for a bit more stay at the hilton if price is an issue anyway you should not be looking at rooms in mayfair
