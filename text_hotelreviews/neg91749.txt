receptionist offered a discount on the breakfast if we paid at check in after that it was not available however if you booked a room directly on the hotel site a complimentary breakfast was included in a lower price than booking com the rooms are filthy they put a queen size bed in a room large enough for a twin bed and call this deluxe the staff is surly what is to like about this place the establishment overrates its accommodations we reserved a deluxe room the first room we had was sub standard and filthy we requested a change to a deluxe room and were moved to a slightly better room both rooms were very low end when we requested a rate adjustment for the difference between deluxe and standard a difference of pounds they gave us a pound courtesy rebate hardly a sufficient adjustment they admitted to the low quality but did nothing about properly adjusting the rates booking com responded to correspondence daily requesting copies of the bill then copies of my credit card statement and then finally refusing to do anything unless i provided photos of the room beware of booking com and this hotel also take photos of everything questionable
