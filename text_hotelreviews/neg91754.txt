a real radiator in the room room one connected to the central heating would have been nice there was a broken sort of heating unit under the window heavier curtains that actually close to block off the window in addition to the thin blind would be good too i appreciate i was in a single room and these are often overlooked by hotels as if we do not matter but to be up in the roof space in a poky room with a tiny electric oil fired radiator plugged in well i think you can do better the duvet was as thin as a pancake and not at all warm i needed the towelling bathrobe on top of my bed and a jumper to sleep in the radiator was plugged into the only useable socket in the room this is because the other sockets are placed so low down you cannot get a plug into them without damaging the flex so for charging phones using a laptop i had to unplug my only heating source plus at in the morning the shower was not hot enough
