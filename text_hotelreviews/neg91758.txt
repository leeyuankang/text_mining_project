staff were not friendly on check in the welcome was poor staff going about their business not really acknowledging a new customer but simply processing us taking our money and the departure staff were not interested how the stay had been they also allowed other guests to interrupt rather than ensuring that our departure was efficiently sorted out before dealing with them we didn t have breakfast but it didn t look worth per person seemed excessive even for london although check out was from the housekeeping staff were knocking on the door to see when we were leaving bed wasn t comfy and pillows flat as pancakes neither my daughter nor i slept well we wouldn t chose this hotel again
