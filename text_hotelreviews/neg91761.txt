the room was very small it was not very clean there were marks on the bedding as you entered the room the frayed carpet i caught my foot in there was very little interaction from staff they only spoke to take my payment told me nothing about breakfast the facilities and didn t make me feel welcome at all the room was old and cold and i was disturbed in the morning by my bell ringing asking if i had reported my heater not working i hadn t reported it but anyway in summary i don t think i have ever stayed somewhere before and not had a friendly welcome or any information just the simple things although the room sink and toilet could of been cleaned better as itvx
