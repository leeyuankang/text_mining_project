the hotel is very dated the whole hotel is dirty the rooms are gloomy we had to move room once as the first room smelt really bad the second room was not much better but we just had to get on with it as they would not refund us our money so we could go somewhere else the staff are rude and not bothered in customer service the breakfast is for dry bacon and dry beans i would never stay here again and don t recommend anyone too there are much cheaper better hotels wish i would of read the review first i am not a person to complain about silly things but this really is a joke
