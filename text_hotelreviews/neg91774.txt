breakfast was cold limited variety and empty when we arrived at staff were not helpful they were cold and everything felt like a chore for them moody is a word i would use for one of them it was not worth each the bed was horrible felt every spring the room was not what we thought from the pictures on the site but felt like a fair size we were front facing so the blue light outside came on at night and our curtain had a few pegs missing so had gaps of light the staff at front desk were not forthcoming or helpful somewhat rude answering the phone whilst speaking to us
