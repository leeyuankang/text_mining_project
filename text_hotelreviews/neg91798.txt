check in not great didn t take my card so caused problems when trying to order room service key card stopped working halfway through stay lifts were fairly temperamental which meant going up and down three flights of stairs most the time ac unit in the room was incredibly loud which meant you couldn t sleep with it running just lots of niggles caused by a lack of attention to detail really and below par service not really what you d expect from such a great location would be hesitant to book again
