issues at check in resolved ultimately a good stay had booked twin rooms but none were available on the day we were allocated super king size rooms which luckily for our group of girls was suitable disappointed by this as there were available twin rooms at the time of booking which is why we chose this hotel the rate was the same the receptionist sent bottles of wine to one room as an apology we appreciated this gesture were happy with the rooms given but would have preferred the combinations we had booked well in advance
