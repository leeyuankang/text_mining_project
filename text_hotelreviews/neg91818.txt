the room was small tired peeling paint and dull colours the safe did not work and was told by reception we know about that thanks for telling us but they did make alternative provision on arrival there was a breakfast offer which we took up to be told the next day by the man on reception we had not his very poor response was to say that the offer was only available if booked on arrival which we had and that as he had no record we had not had to make a bit of a fuss which at least the restaurant manager understood what i was saying the man on reception has no understanding of customer service
