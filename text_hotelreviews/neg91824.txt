the staff and management was rude and extremely unhelpful we paid for accommodation on bookings com when we got to the hotel they made us pay again so we paid double accommodation the reception lady was the rudest and most unfriendly person we have ever come across the tap in the bathroom was broken the plug was broken the room was tiny the air conditioning was broken there was a portable aircon that was put in the room by the window in essence the window had to stay open the entire night and we could not get any sleep as we could hear all the noise from the street with the window being open park lane mews hotel was the most expensive in the area did not include breakfast whenever we asked for assistance everyone treated us badly and made us feel like we are a problem to them this is without a doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed at and i do not recommend this hotel to anyone
