receptionist seemed a little concerned that we had such a cheap rate from booking com and reminded us that it would be over next time we wanted to stay the room was very small very basic and quite tired the bed springs were coming through the mattress so was quite an uncomfortable night arrived for breakfast mins before they stopped serving and instead of a good morning we were informed that we had minutes left she seemed annoyed that we had arrived towards the end of service and that she wouldn t be able to clear down as early as she d hoped poured us both cold coffee and because english wasn t her native tongue it was quite difficult to get it changed quite an unpleasant experience all round really and wouldn t go back
