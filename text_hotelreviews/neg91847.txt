on arrival at the hotel it was apparent that the standard of hygiene was below that you would expect from the prices of the facility the corridors were smelling of tobacco where guests had clearly been smoking indoors when we got to the room myself and my wife were uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning the very old air conditioning in the room had a damp smell that was reminiscent of drainage system the poor climate control was further hampered by the window being screwed closed breakfast was equally disappointing and the response from the staff was typical of the experience i would not stay in this hotel again and nor would i recommend it to friends
