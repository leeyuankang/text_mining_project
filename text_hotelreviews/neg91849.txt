the hotel looks quite tired and could do with being updated i paid for one night my friend booked shortly before me and paid for two nights she had breakfast included i was advised that i required to pay for breakfast i informed a member of staff that all i wanted was tea and toast she then required to speak to her colleague who in turn required to speak to someone else this took some time so by the time she informed me i could pay for tea and toast only my friends had finished their breakfast no discretion was used by the staff and i left the hotel hungry not great customer service
