can t expect every hotel to be perfect in every way although i agree with other guest s reviews the decor should have been changed a long time ago not sure how good the double glazing is a great location and the hotel was reasonably priced for the centre of london overall a good hotel experience but it could have been a great experience with a few tweaks and a focus on decor
