the internet service went down in the evening before i left several phone calls to the front desk were met with the response that the router had been reset only after about three hours did they acknowledge that the service was not functioning nor was it restored prior to my departure thus it was not functioning for the final of my stay this was aggravating because i could accomplish no work and there was no solution to be had by the hotel the staff apologized but i know it was out of their hands and in the hands of the cable company who was on sight as i departed
