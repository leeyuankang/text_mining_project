the staff couldn t be bothered to help our first encounter on entering the hotel was a young woman who said reception s not my job talk to him the second encounter was no better with the receptionist telling us his day was about to get better because his shift was nearly over he gave us electronic keys and we had to ask where the room was because the receptionist hadn t said on entering the room a double accessible room we found the bed was pushed against the wall and was far from accessible there was mould growing on the walls the paper was hanging off the wall under the window and the carpet was frayed and dirty we returned to reception to ask if there was a more suitable room available and were told i am not authorised to move rooms you ll have to speak to the next person who come onto reception needless to say we were disappointed as this was a birthday treat and whilst we were not paying the full rate we would have expected better service from a mayfair hotel
