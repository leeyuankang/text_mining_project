cheapest in the area for a reason unfortunately was still far too much for a cramped room with a tiny double bed and a shower that s shorter than me the shabby look i can deal with but the staff staring at us while we were waiting for friends in the reception bar area was a bit off the breakfast tasted of dust but i imagine it s difficult to find fresh ingredients when you re in central london i guess all of the other establishments have scooped them up shouldn t moan as that was included in the price and service at breakfast again reminded us that it was cheap
