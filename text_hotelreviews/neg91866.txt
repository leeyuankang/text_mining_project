the hotel needs a revamp and a damn good clean the reception gives you a sense of gradure and then beyond that it s stuck in the s with dirty worn out furniture and carpets the room was disgusting the carpet was dirty and ill fitted with peeling wall paper and the valance was stained and disgusting the toilet didn t even flush wasted and the breakfast was equally awful the cooked breakfast was dripping in fat and then i asked for porridge that wasn t inc in the price and i was told i had to pay sadly that was equally awful so i left hungry and totally disappointed why didn t i complain the staff s english wasn t t good and i didn t speak their native tongue a truly awful hotel that is masked on this web page by the posh name and location
