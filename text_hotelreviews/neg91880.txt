breakfast and service at breakfast wasn t great felt very disorganised and hectic room was small very dated and bed was poor quality particularly the pillows which were very thin everything about the room was a bit cheap we couldn t open our window either we got this room on a deal but if we had paid full price i think we would have asked for a partial refund really not up to standard and definitely not stars
