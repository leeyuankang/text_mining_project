hotel pictures must be old as hotel looks battered it really is in desperate need of a refurb expensive for the standard of bedroom accommodation look around before choosing to stay here as it really is disappointing and not good representation of value for money rooms are small bathrooms not full size general cleanliness poor i did not take my shoes off in bedroom as carpet was so dirty had room not been just a crash pad then i would have complained bedroom furnishings so dated and bashed looks like a run down b b noisy too guests coming in at all times yes i know it s a hotel paper thin walls and located near lift avoid receptionist was not very inviting i must have interrupted her conversion with her colleague to check in prepare for a short stroll to nearest tube when i requested a taxi at reception i was told to walk to the hilton hotel wish i d stayed at the hilton returned to hotel around midnight straight in past night manager who did not even look at me i could have been anyone going into lift breakfast was busy and although looked ok selection all needed replenishing and had to keep asking the waitresses who were so busy for items so i would not stay here again or recommend don t be mislead by the pictures glad that i was solo as embarassed hotel was not my usual standards
