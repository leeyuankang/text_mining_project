had to wait minutes to be checked in no receptionist then was given a room where the lights didn t work and was next to a lift on my booking i had put a request for a room not next to the lift rooms are tired and dated bed very uncomfortable and room was very cold i have stayed here several times before and the only reason i come back is the location if i could find somewhere else i wouldn t come back having said that the staff are friendly enough
