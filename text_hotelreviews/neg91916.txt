got into a dirty bed full of stale breadcrumbs and fingernail clippings at at night they moved the room straight away and the receptionist saw it and was really embarrassed when spoke to the management the next day they weren t bothered at all and said they d look into it and call back but nothing they could do they never called back really poor service and completely inexperienced and such a shame given what a great location this is
