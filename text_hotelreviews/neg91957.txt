i would not stay here our room was so small you could not swing a cat in it there was no space to put our bags and as the bed was pushed against the wall i had to climb over the furniture to get to it the room was designed for a disabled person but there is no way a disabled person would have been able to move in this room or manage a wheelchair or walking frame in the bathroom we had to pay an extra pounds for an upgrade
