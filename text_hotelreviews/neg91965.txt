the only thing that i thought needed improving was the telephone in my room no matter how i tried i could not get it to work or to let me even phone home when i went downstairs to tell the staff this they told me that they could get this done for fifty pounds sterling this was my only complaint but i was not going to pay fifty pounds to get a phone call to my wife at home apart from this no other problems a good hotel indeed
