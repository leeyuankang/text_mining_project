very very unhelpful rude staff one lady and a man during the check in two visitors in front of us were treated badly without any respect not very well to us either even though they know that we are british couple next morning whilst waiting for check out they were found to be unhelpful to another visitor who was waiting for breakfast a long time the breakfast was a joke we will never stay there again very expensive to stay even in london standard the worn out room was just enough for the double bed we almost have to dive into the bed
