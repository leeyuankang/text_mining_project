rooms were in a shabby and very run down state beds were basic and bathroom barely adequate this hotel has plummeted in standard in the last years when we stayed here last it was the hilton mews and it was a very high standard small hotel small is fine when quality is good the breakfast was most disappointing a very basic one star buffet with poor quality food when i last stayed here a very high quality english breakfast was served from the kitchen i don t mind a buffet if it is a high standard but this was rubbish
