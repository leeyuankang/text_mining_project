i arrived after a long journey keen to get into my room no one at all on duty in reception the restaurant manager did phone for someone but no one responded and i was left hanging around for over minutes until the receptionist finally arrived no apology for keeping me waiting just he was dealing with a guest clearly they do not have sufficient staff on duty if they leave reception every time a guest needs something after this bad start i spent a comfortable night and the girl on reception in the morning was far more pleasant the evening staff let the place down
