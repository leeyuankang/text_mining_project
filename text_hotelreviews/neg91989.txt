poorly fitted out and shabby rooms the rooms i booked were heavily discounted evidently because i am a genius booker i have a feeling that these rooms are always at a discount so booking com are being disingenuous the full room tariff was for a double for which i paid i can t believe the room we stayed in was worth at any time
