i felt that the service was perfunctory at best the barman was unwelcoming the champagne was flat and i had to ask to get the usual crisps or olives with the glass of champagne i ordered continental breakfast which cost with a room service charge i m used to spending that for a good hotel s breakfast but it was poor one patty of flora rather than butter and grapefruit juice made from concentrate for a hilton hotel on park lane albeit the mews property rather than the major hotel that is damned poor i would not stay there again an american tourist or any other tourist to the hotel would be very disappointed i also felt that had i been a man in a suit in the bar ordering champagne that the service would have been better
