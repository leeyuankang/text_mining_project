where do we start the fact that the toilet did not work we reported this and when out for the evening to find that when we got back the toilet was still the same offered a double room check it out to find that this room on the ground floor was like a drive through with the traffic outside only room left was a twin but even this toilet was bordering on the not working the noise outside into the wee small hours didn t help so got a could of hrs sleep for for the night and the lack of comfort it was a bit much it would have been nice to have been offered a discount but this was not forth comming we don t complain but we feel we have to for other customers looking at this hotel it was nice to get home for a good nights sleep
