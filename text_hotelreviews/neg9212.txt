i was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that i would have to be accommodated in a sister property there was mild surprise i had not received prior informatio but that did not ring true i politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised i needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point i had booked in inverness terrace because that was where i wanted to be this was poor stuff and i would like your comments as the booking agents you have always served me well in the past moira lawson
