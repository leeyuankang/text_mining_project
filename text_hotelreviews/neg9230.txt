tiny rooms and unfortunately i had an unpleasant case with staff on reception my friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left so after spending minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them i didnt expect that this could happen in london
