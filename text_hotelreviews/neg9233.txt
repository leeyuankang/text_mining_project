i booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom the sink was so small why bother when i leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me what idiot designed that love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable the bathroom could have been made metre wider and had a decent wash basin puts me off staying again
