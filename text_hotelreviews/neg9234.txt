old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night draughts could also be felt coming through the windows the hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself
