there seemed to be huge communication difficulties we asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve i lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double by this time it was about the receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast at breakfast we asked for coffee teas and fruit tea we got coffee and two fruit teas when i pointed out the mistake we were brought more tea at this point we gave up and my daughter and i shared the tea when we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it not good we very nearly missed the train all in all it was quite tiresome
