the rooms were small and very tired all needs refurbishment my initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed the quilt was too small for the bed and i could hear people talking asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated have stayed in better hotels in london for less
