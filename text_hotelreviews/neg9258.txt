the bedroom was really cold and had single glazing apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning that wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room our room was at the front of the hotel and i had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny the bedroom door couldn t even open fully
