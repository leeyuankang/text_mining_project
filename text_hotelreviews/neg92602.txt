i was very much looking forward to staying at the ship inn but there is so much wrong with the hotel part of this property i was really disappointed my room had one of the most uncomfortable beds i have slept on for decades re the bathroom there were already items in the bathroom bin when i entered the room the spare toilet roll was a partially used roll and the shower sliding doors did not close properly the bathroom was overall clean but the shower cubicle could do with a good scrub as there is quite a bit of limescale re the room itself the sockets on one side of the room did not work the tv remote control did not work and half of the commands on the tv itself didn t either it was full of dust under the side lamp by the bed the kettle did not switch itself off when boiling water and the milk was past is use by date definitely overpriced for the quality of accommodation provided
