i know london prices are expensive but it did seem a bit expensive for just a night although the price of the full breakfast was reasonable i did not have it so no knowledge of quality i suggest chucking in a free cup of coffee and a croissant would make it feel better value at little cost to the provider the entrance off mare st was a bit daunting along a short dark alley with an inebriated chap sitting on the step at the door of the pub but in fact it was not a problem the stairs up to the rooms were a bit tatty but the room itself was fine
