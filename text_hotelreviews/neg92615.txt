when i entered the room i found it extremely small and the heating was full on tried opening the window to sleep better and not suffocate the room was right above the pub s entrance and the noise of people smocking and laughing right under my window was impossible beside i slept very badly all night once the street noise settled down the noise started behind my door either people coming back late or leaving early the sound of squeaking wooden floor was intolerable and kept me awake since am my single bed was so soft and springy it felt like sleeping on a bouncy castle to finalise i was asked to check out at although most hotels let you use the room until midday totally disappointed to be most honest with you the chap at the reception was friendly enough but never gave me the internet code and was working from behind the bar during football night so i could hardly hear what he was telling me
