what they call a superior double room is a box room i wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room we put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room as we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order how many other people have they tried this on it s value for money if you re not messed around
