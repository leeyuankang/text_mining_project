nothing other than the fire smoke alarm going off at which was out of the hotels control however the time it took to let us know if it was a real fire or a test should have been quicker we had to work out for ourselves procedures should probably be checked to mitigate any other risk in the future however would definitely recommend even if it meant burning in my bed
