booking information held by venue stated that i was not expected until the day after i had booked and family room i had reserved was not available for the an available double room was given instead fortunately my son who was to share the room with me was delayed until breakfast time so the fact that it was a double room was fortuitously not an issue i was given a partial refund for the smaller room
