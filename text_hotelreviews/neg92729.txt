the photos advertised on the pages showed nice vintage bath tubs what i didn t know was that there were only a select few rooms that had them the shower rooms i had in my room were good but i was expecting a bath tub i asked reception and they said that it should have been stated in the requests section during the booking at least i know for next time some of the lighting for say the dressing table was obscure and difficult to find
