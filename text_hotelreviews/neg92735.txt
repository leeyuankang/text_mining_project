the rooms could have been cleaner especially the carpet and bathrooms which looked as if they needed more of a deep clean to get the showers and grout sparkling the sink in our room was also cracked our tv didn t work and despite telling them on the first day that it wasn t working it wasn t fixed parking was very limited so we had to leave our car on the street one night and move it before which wasn t ideal the staff at the desk whilst friendly didn t seem to know how much breakfast cost as it wasn t included in our rate and we were simply told to go and ask at the bar we ate there on the second evening and whilst by two boys enjoyed their kids meals which were reasonably priced i had a salad which was awful no dressing fatty meat etc the bar area could also have done with a clean the tables and bar had a lot of drink spills which nobody seemed to be bothered about and we had to ask them to clean our table before we sat down we would also have liked to have gone to sit in the lounge area which looked really nice but it had been booked by a private party so we weren t able to use it the downstairs entrance from the car park staff entrance could also have done with a really good clean not a great first impression the garden was huge and would have been nice to have sat in but again looked rather neglected the most disappointing thing was that none of the staff asked us how our stay was or if we d enjoyed our meals etc
