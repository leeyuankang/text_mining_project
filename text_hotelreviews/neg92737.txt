the bathroom was huge which was great until we saw the shower curtin we haven t seen a shower curtin since the early s not only was it ugly but the bottom of the curtin appeared to have yellow urine stains on it and mould it needs to be bleached or thrown out there was no bar fridge which was extremely frustrating there was a little cooler box sitting on the desk which could hold no more than a few cans of soda the restaurant was over priced breakfast made us laugh as it was pounds for a few bland cereals a couple of small cakes and one piece of toast when checking out we asked the man at reception to organise a taxi for us instead he called a chauffeur company next door to the hotel i can t remember the name which was frustrating as a taxi would have been much cheaper when it comes time to pay the chauffeur we are told cash only which is fantastic when all we had were our credit and debit cards
