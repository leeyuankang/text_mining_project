location of our room was not the best room at the entrance of the corridor leading to all rooms so constant opening and closing of door outside our room and clients that are less thoughtful than others in how much noise they make disturbing your sleep which is never good i would also comment that there were quite a few marks on the walls and not sure what they were but several were higher up the wall near the tv so really not sure how that had happened after being served what seemed like a nice breakfast bap the tomato sauce bottle exploded upon opening it all over my face and glasses and fresh clean t shirt which i was less than happy with and the contents of the sauce bottle looked like fizzy tomato sauce which was very unappetising to be honest i did report it and whilst a couple of staff were surprised to hear it their apologies seemed pretty disingenuous to me unfortunately the damage was done already and it really did put a dampener on the morning i didn t feel the breakfast layout was the best either and it certainly wasn t overly clear as to where the milk was kept and upon returning to my seat and asking we were informed that the milk was kept in a large metal bowl on the bar along with the juices that were kept there too it could do with being a little clearer for my mind
