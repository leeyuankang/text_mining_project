the hotel no longer has the swimming pool facility contract with the local spa but this is not reflected in partnered booking site deals this loss of facility did not change the price and nor did it bother the manager that i had specifically chosen a hotel with this facility to find out on the day of arrival with a nonchalant approach that the contract no longer exists i would have chosen a different hotel closer to the centre with a built in pool for less money
