unprofessional staff at breakfast put us on the spot and kept hammering on about whether we allready paid for breakfast or not we didn t due to a misunderstanding when booking so they kept on hammering the issue until i settled it with reception we appreciate a tranquile atmosphere when just out of bed not the kind of borderline harassement we experienced here the breakfast wasn t even worth it
