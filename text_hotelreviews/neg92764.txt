it was a hot weekend aprox degrees and our room was in the sun for the majority of the day but the air conditioning room temp unit wasn t great and as such we were quite hot throughout the night can t be helped though except maybe an upgrade to the temp control and shouldn t complain when we got to spend the weekend at such a lovely hotel in the sunshine
