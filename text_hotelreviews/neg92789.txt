it was extremely dirty everywhere in the room the most expensive room in the hotel in the bathroom the floor was like in public toilet there was a trash and hairs among our clean towels it seemed that house keepers made cleaning by our new towels and left them for us in the bedroom everything starting from bed covers to curtains was stained unfortunately we had to leave the hotel earlier than had planned
