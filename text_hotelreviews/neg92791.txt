the hotel was experiencing heating problems which they said as been all winter however we had no heating and was freezing which made the stay unpleasant we notified the staff who gave us a plug in heater but didn t do much didn t have heat coming off so was left very cold with a year old this was booked for my birthday and liked refit was a roll bath but couldn t use this has the bath was freezing quite disappointed i feel hotel should tell the guest so we could of been aware and had the option of cancelling
