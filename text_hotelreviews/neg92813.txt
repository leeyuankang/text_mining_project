though the neighbourhood of ealing is nice it is a bit of trip from the hotel to the city you either have to walk minutes to ealing broadway to take the underground or take the overground back to ealing broadway from west ealing station which is the next stop and right across the road the district and city line will get you to the city in roughly minutes still that is very doable and as for the hotel itself no complaints whatsoever
