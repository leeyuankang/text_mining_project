while the bedrooms were very clean the downstairs not so much tables were always very tacky as if they hadn t been washed thoroughly weren t given clean cutlery for each course at night had to keep cutlery from starter to use on main course breakfast menu was very good but horrified when we came down to breakfast one morning to find the seat we were going to sit in was completely covered in dog hair which means hair could very easily get into the food in ireland dogs are not allowed in eating places unless it s a guide dog and that should be the case in all eating establishments
