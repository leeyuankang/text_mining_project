at the bar no eye contact with customers as they have to look at the touch screen till they just can t ask what you want pour it serve it and take the money they are unable to take more than one order at a time and keep asking for one sec when given a task at breakfast they were understaffed in the area for food at there were no breakfast bowls for cereal no yoghurt and or no pastries left teething problems i think it was the same in the kent public house also always going to til first before pouring and serving a pint touchscreens are great for education not in hostelry and hotel businesses
