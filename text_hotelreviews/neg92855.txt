we were told that the bar and restaurant were being refurbished as we weren t eating or drinking there that wasn t a problem for us however they lied it was also the function room lobby and garden as well being refurbished we basically walked into a building site i even had to wipe dust off the counter annoyed that i had to pay to spend a night with a baby in a building site my temper wasn t tempered when we arrived for breakfast in the function room or should i say the highway for builders the hotel didn t even have a high chair for the baby thoroughly disappointed and a waste of money
