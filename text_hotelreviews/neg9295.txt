i think this may be a london wide problem and i also have good hearing but i could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning the room could have been a bit cleaner i think the turn around is very busy there seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish i expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a london hotel and there was a slight mix up with our room but the manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time i return to london any points i didn t like are simply little things
