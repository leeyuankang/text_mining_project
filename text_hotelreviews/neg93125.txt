the bed was a standard double not as pictured on booking com certainly not extra large the bath was also not as pictured the spa package i booked was not written down and was unavailable the spa staff were unaware a promotion was even on the small pool at the spa was so tiny and dirty that it had jets to swim against which would have been great but they didn t work people were playing loud music and video chatting on their phones in the spa but when i mentioned this to staff i was told they don t have a no phone policy the masseur was nowhere near qualified or skilled enough for the price charged ok for a college graduate freebie massage but i was pleased when it was over which was less than the hour i had paid for wish i d asked for a discount in the spa for poor massage and broken facilities we ended up leaving early and didn t go back the next morning
