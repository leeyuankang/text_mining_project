the wifi was a problem peak hours imposible to use it the waiting time is too long to load a simple page not even talking about videos it would always throw your device out of the wifi if you re not using it iphones or ipads which is very annoying don t know if it s just our problem everything was up to date but i think that since it s a hotel of such level needs to have a very powerful equipement to provide with great wifi the cleaning can definetly be improved for a hotel removing white residue from the tap or any other bathroom equipment comes without saying as well as mopping the floor everyday or at least vacuum cleaning to remove the hair from the tile when needed there is no charger in the bathroom for the hairdryer that they provide so i had to dry it in the bedroom but then a lot of dust fell of the ceiling or the cupboard that was very unpleasant especially for a person with asthma maybe instead of changing the sheets everyday they should improve the general cleaning of the room it is more of a neutral note but the phone that is given is not that useful it s a bit slow hotspot doesn t really work and during our week long stay we only used it once
