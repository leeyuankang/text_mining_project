the only thing we didn t like which made us unhappy was the taxi cab which took us to airport from hotel however it s not related to hotel directly but as the hotel booked the taxi for us it would be better they consider taxi organisation sending good mannered drivers for hotel guests the taxi driver scammed us and shouted on us was very bad experience
