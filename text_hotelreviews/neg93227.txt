toilet would not stop refilling staff seemed to be very aware of issue as they were able to immediately without calling a plumber rectify the issue by going in to the hallway and fiddling with the cistern not ideal when you have to go in the middle of the night then have to call staff to fix the toilet each time you flush genius perks booking says you can check out hours later the hotel says the latest you can check out is which is only hour later than normal checkout they said if you want to check out later than that they will charge extra we had booked this hotel specifically for the late checkout as we were going to get ready in the hotel to attend an afternoon black tie event i insisted on the pm check out and was told to check again in the morning to see if that was possible again in the morning we were told we had to vacate by in the end the staff made an exception and allowed us to check out at but to be honest i would expect that if booking give you a perk for being a top customer this should be cleared with and honoured by the hotel i also made a mention of the request to check out late on my booking the hotel claimed they hadn t received that
