the only issue i had was that as i booked through booking com on the day of my stay a pending transaction for the room was taken from my account to guarantee my booking upon arrival i then had use the chip and machine to pay however this seemed to debit a different transaction whilst leaving one pending causing a double charge the hotel advised they had cancelled the pending one however this would take days to show back on my available balance
