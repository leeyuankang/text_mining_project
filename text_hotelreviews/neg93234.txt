only criticism is the room did not have a window which was rather a shame but as everything else was great we didn t complain overall lovely room but a window is something i like in a room i am a little claustrophobic and i would of liked a bath rather than a shower but these are little things which did not take away from the fantastic hotel the montcalm is maybe this is something that could be asked in checkin what is your preference
