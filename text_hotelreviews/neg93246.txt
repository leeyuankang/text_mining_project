i ve stayed at a lot of hotels in london at least once a week when i saw a deal on this one i figured i d give it a go maybe because it was a deal and i didn t pay top price i was given a shoe box room who knows it was at the end of the corridor near the staff lift and stores while the staff where lovely and the bed was comfortable it just wasn t worth the normal price tag so many other way better hotels around breakfast was ok overall it s just ok disappointed really
