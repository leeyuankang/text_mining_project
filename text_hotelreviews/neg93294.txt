the carpet in the room looked old and of need of a cleaning and vacuuming i didn t like the over priced dinner in the restaurant i ordered the lamb chop and it was lacking flavor and the vegetables were raw and under cooked it didn t not warrant the pound cost i didn t like that i had to wait mins to get my vehicle from vallet parking because of the delay i missed my ferry back to france
