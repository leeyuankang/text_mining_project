the room was dark and dingy and stank like smoke the room had single glazed windows making it extremely loud felt like cars were drinking straight through the room the room was bright but also stank of smoke and we were told all these rooms were non smoking extremely hard to believe as each time we left and came back the smell got worse no amount of spray or fresh air can get rid of that
