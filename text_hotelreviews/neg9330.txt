i think the guy working in the bar feb night around has some problem i ordered for the drink but he only served to other customers and i asked twice for the drink again he only said if you just sit down there i will bring up the drink and then i just left after mins waiting and wasting since he has been serving other customers continually but not to me the bar was not even busy at all
