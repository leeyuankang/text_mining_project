when we arrived we were sent to another hotel because of some rooms being out of order we didn t like this since the other hotel was of a lower standard the room was tiny and the breakfast wasn t very good especially the coffee was bad just not what we booked but on the next day we went back to the grande royal to tell them of our dissatisfaction and they offered us an upgraded room and free breakfast for the rest of our stay we really appreciated this gesture thank you very much
