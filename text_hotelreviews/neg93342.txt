room was below ground level small and hot yes it had all the usual bits and pieces and was no means bad but there are may much better at the price food and drink a bit over priced especially breakfast the staff tend to just watch you and chat to each other rather than help but not rude i have stayed a couple of times and yes it is ok but there is better at this price range
