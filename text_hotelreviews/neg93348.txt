the room we booked was a delux double we got a tiny room facing a wall and with a small bed after complaining to a very courteous and friendly staff we got free breakfast as apology and upgraded to a junior suite the following day what they called a junior suite was a normal size room facing the front of the building three issues a this is not a star hotel b their room description is misleading c breakfast was mediocre
