firstly i would like to say that my husband and i are very relaxed and grateful people and i think this may have been the first time i have left a negative review we are very blessed to travel often with work and i always review the hotels we stay in on our arrival we were shown around our room by a lovely lady but at the end of our little tour she asked us to put a positive review on trip advisor as the hotel isn t doing that well at the moment when you spend quite a bit of money on a hotel thats the last thing you want to hear it all seemed fine to me until i checked the mini bar where a number of items were half eaten drunk and the wine glasses smelt of fresh wine which made us think they had just had a rinse in the sink i was not impressed thats what i expect when i go camping with teenagers not in a star hotel the staff were very embarrassed and four door bell calls later the issue was sorted out by a very flustered lady i also went out for most of the day and pressed the button for the room to be made up and hopefully the mini bar to be restocked but when i can home in the evening this had not happened it made me feel like this hotel did not put much value on the basic expectations and i definatly didn t feel like this was a special trip as i had planned it to be also they lost out on us helping ourselves to some yummy mini bar options
