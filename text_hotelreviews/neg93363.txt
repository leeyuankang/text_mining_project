a wake up alarm that was inbuilt in the room and which i had not set or touched at all went off at which totally ruined my entire nights sleep and the following day this was completely avoidable the hotel should ensure that this doesn t happen i complained to the duty manager and all she suggested was an upgrade next time and a complimentary breakfast next time which would not be sufficient to persuade me to return added to that when i turned the shower on i and the bathroom were quite fiercely and unexpectedly soaked as the cleaner had left one of the shower heads facing out the main thing guests want when staying away is a good nights sleep and value for money this hotel failed to get the basics right
