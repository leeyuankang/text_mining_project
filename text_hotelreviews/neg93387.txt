the breakfast buffet gets depleted and replacing items just takes way too long even all the fruit juices run out and take mins to replace other items just don t get replaced unless you ask even an hour or two before breakfast completes the club room offering is a bit stingy i have asked for lemon slices to be provided before tonics were run out on my first evening and despite asking were never replenished during the hour i was in there the drinks glasses are small feels like portion control my advice as a world traveller is don t see your club room as a expense control exercise when guests are paying several hundred pounds for their room to gain access see it as a way to wow your customers i know some of the best club rooms around the world and i seek them out when booking quite a small proportion of guests actually bother to use club rooms so treat the ones that do
