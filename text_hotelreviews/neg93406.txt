the only thing that could be improved for us was the breakfast experience i don t know if you were short staffed that morning but more staff required to clear tables and ensure tables relayed our table had no butter no jam marmalade and we asked for more toast but it never arrived the bacon was not of the quality we would have expected it didn t spoil our trip at all and we will stay again but worth looking at the breakfast management
