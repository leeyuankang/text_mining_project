housekeeping staff were nice but did not have boundaries they walked into the room a couple of times even though we had the do not disturb light on the cleanliness was terrible the cleaning products included a bucket with small cleaning products in it and that was all it was definitely not suitable to clean the room properly i also noticed that during our weeks in the hotel the carpet floors were not vacuumed once there was hair and dust collecting in the corners and under the desk they also kept returning the already used towels the ones i d leave in the bathtub back they did not change the towels until i purposely threw them on the bathroom s floor and spilled some water on them the overall cleanliness of the room made me feel as though it was a or star hotel the bed and pillows were uncomfortable
