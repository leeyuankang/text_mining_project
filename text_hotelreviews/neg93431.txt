we had gone out for the night and someone had come in and left shower products on our bed and took away the cushions from our bed this isn t a problem but a warning to the customers that this would happen would of been nice or even bring the products while we was still in the room the other thing is the price of parking i understand its london but at least the hotel should give their staying customers some sort of discount the price of things in the room should also be adjusted e g for a handful of haribo sweets
