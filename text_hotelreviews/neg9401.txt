wifi service is very poor and you have to log in every time they mixed up our breakfast order twice placed us in the basement despite my request to be in upper foors it was very noisy the room service was very poor they were using the towels to clean the washroom floors and the bed sheets were not changed despite having stains on it this is the first hotel i experience in my life that they don t have a scale to weigh our luggage
