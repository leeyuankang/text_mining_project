on our second night some neighbours across the road from the hotel had a party until with people out in the street and loud music literally all night the police came but no one stopped the party i don t know if this happens often but sure didn t get any sleep it s mind blowing to think the police couldn t stop the party the behaviour didn t fit in with the look of the area
