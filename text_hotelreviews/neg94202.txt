our room was very small and there was a funny smell in the bathroom when we arrived like drains we reported the smell and this was fixed quite quickly although it did keep coming back during our stay our room was incredibly hot but we were unable to turn the radiator down on the second day of our stay there was no hot water so we had to keep boiling the kettle to fill up the bath with hot water the carpet along the side of the dressing table wasn t clean there was even a hair band on the floor left by a previous guest and the area behind the curtain was quite dirty as well
