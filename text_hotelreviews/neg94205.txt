the whole hotel s management and organization due to an incident some sort of an emergency case of some other guests there was no room for me in the beginning the hotel tried to find me another hotel but i disagreed because that would have been too far away from my parents the other option was to put me in a very very tine cabin maybe cabin with a bunk bed which was a blatant joke for the first night also without a refund after i ve protested hard against those conditions they finally agreed to find me a solution what outraged me most was that people couples got a double bed room after my arrival and my check in hour before that was totally in my opinion not ok and not a correct way how to deal with clients in the end i had to stay for one night in some sort of submarine room and for my night they finally upgraded me to a junior suite room it was in total overprized especially after we had to deal with so many issues incident after my parents had arrived the hotel staff gave them a room somewhere in the basement it was very dark smelly and the balcony view was facing directly to some sort of backyard outward flow full of rats do not get this room if you have booked a double bed room i d highly recommend you not to stay there my dad had explicitly called booking com and the hotel in advance in order not to get a room in the basement because he already read some bad reviews about that certain room from other hotel guests and yet they gave them exactly that room the whole situation was already very tense and we became more and more angry combined with disappointment we were very close to file a legal complaint to either booking com or some other sort of legal actions in the end one receptionist italian guy agreed to upgrade me to a junior suite room a change for my parent s room and one free breakfast for all of us
