the bathroom was so hot from the heat produced by the towel rail i was told by reception that someone would come to my room to have a look at it but was asked in the meantime to turn the fan on but it was noisy and didn t reduce the heat that much likewise the temperature of the water was very hot even on the lowest setting the bathroom itself was clean and there were clean towels every day
