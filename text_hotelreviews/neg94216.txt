the first day we were put up on the floor club room which didn t meet the expectations at all later on the day on our request we were shifted to the floor which was a better room however coffee tea machine wasn t provided in the room as mentioned on the website they ran out of slippers and hot water wasn t coming in the toilets for days and heating was not working in the toilet but the staff is very friendly and goes out of the way to accommodate their guests requirements
