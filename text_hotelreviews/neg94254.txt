the restaurant staff was inefficient slow and untrained order pancakes for breakfast and they were microwave reheated and over cooked asked the reception to find us a taxi after waiting for minutes and asking times of the eta of the car finally arrived a car that charged us to go mile when i told the driver that we have paid gbp for the same trip he told me that it was a special service working for the hotel i was not informed when i asked them to book that it was nothing else than a black cab very disappointing
