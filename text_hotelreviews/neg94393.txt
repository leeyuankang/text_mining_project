beware the tub upon exiting my tub after showering i discovered the material in the bottom of the tub to prevent falls had been worn down and was of no use as a result with the left foot part way out of the tub my right foot slipped on the slippery tub base resulting in my falling hard again the sides and bottom of the tub i was lucky to not have hit my head the tub was narrow and had very tall sides and because the tub was wet after the shower and no traction it took almost minutes to find a way to get out of the tub i was alone in the room very very scary i am not a young person and a month later i am still recovering from strains sprains bruises pain etc resulting from the fall they did offer to change me to a room with a regular shower nice offer for another day but did not help for the fall already taken
