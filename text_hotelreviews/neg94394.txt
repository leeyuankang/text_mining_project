the only problem we had was eating breakfast at the restaurant our breakfast was not included with the room we didn t want the buffet that was person we wanted to order from the a la cart menu we were able to do so but felt forgotten in the corner and had to wait a long time for service also had to track down the bill we didn t go back the rest of the week i m sure it would have been a better experience if we had the breakfast included option
