the room smelled really musky the first day but the odor went away after we aired the room the service was appalling especially for a hotel of this category nobody helped us with the luggage the waiters did not understand english nor did they know the difference between a macchiato and a latte the concierge was often missing smoking a cigarette the food at the restaurant was just ok nothing impressive despite the publicity of the hotel taunting it as one of the best in london and the service was again painfully slow despite the fact that there were not that many customers finally the breakfast buffet had a lot to be desired with regard to fruits they were either previously frozen or in preserve it was especially to be regretted that they substituted real berries when they are excellent in england from previously frozen ones the shower door did not close properly so the bathroom got flooded any time we took a shower we dried it with the towels mercifully there is a great tower warmer that dried the towels relatively quickly the bathroom is a little crumpled and there is not much room around the sink for toilettries
