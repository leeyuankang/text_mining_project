this is an esthetically pleasing hotel on the surface however perhaps due to the age of the building it lacks the comfort factor found in more contemporary hotels rooms have limited storage area and amenities such as coffee are stored away and awkward to access bathrooms are small and a more substantial shower curtain would have been able to withstand the draft resulting in less water on the floor upon arrival while waiting for our room to be readied we had a couple of drinks in the bar the cost was pounds the hotel adds a service charge service in general was adequate but hardly star except for the doormen who were to a man courteous and very helpful this hotel represents itself as star hotel and it would seem they rely on their excellent location and outward attractiveness to merit this rating a better value for the price will be sought next time
