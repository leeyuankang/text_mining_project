we were very disappointed it took over hours to get our luggage to our room and this was after asking times where the luggage was the bathroom was fine but the separate shower was not working there was a shower over the bath but this was not practical as water escaped over the side of the bath it was not pointed out to us on check in that we had to request the turndown service which was why when we got back to the room little bugs had entered as the windows were left open on check out my wife and i waited with our luggage at the lifts my wife managed to squeeze into one of the lifts to get down to reception to pay the bill i was left waiting to get the lift with the luggage it took more than minutes to have access to a lift we looked forward to staying at horseguards and we were let down
