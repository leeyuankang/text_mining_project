we were surprised and disappointed to find that the room we had booked on the basis that it had an interior view in actual fact had no view at all the windows are opaque room that should not be acceptable at this price in a london city centre hotel the room we upgraded to was very pleasant but i have to say did not make up for the unsuitable first offering
