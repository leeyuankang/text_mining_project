i didn t like being told that my complimentary mini bar was going to be restocked daily and it never was restocked i had to call each time and then was told it is only done every other day and it still was never restocked i didn t like that they gave me body soap instead of shampoo on more than one occasion i wasn t a big fan of the restaurant i didn t like that room service selection was limited i didn t like that my room telephone didn t work so when i would call down to the front desk or try to order room service i couldn t i told them at the desk about it and it was never addressed seemed i just had to call and call to get anything done or go down to the front desk to get answers over all it was a nice central hotel for the money corinthia hotel is across the street and looked fabulous and had two wonderful places to eat i will be looking into this hotel for any future visits
