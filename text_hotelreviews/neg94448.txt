disappointed with the room was expecting much better from a establishment the room size was extremely small and the decor was quite dated the bathroom was also looking quite tired i wouldn t expect a luxury hotel to have a plastic shower curtain we were kept awake until the early hours by a wedding that was being hosted in the hotel although we were provided with a complimentary breakfast to apologise i felt that this was very disappointing considering the price of the room there was basic free provisions water and coke in the mini bar but nothing else was provided the bathroom toiletries were elemis but limited compared to other establishments
