you can only provide a star experience when every aspect of the service offered is star in my opinion the management of the royal horseguards hotel falls short in the one thing they should excel in ensure their staff has the eye for detail or their guests for that matter needed to offer a star experience there were some happy exceptions like the man who served us afternoon tea but generally staff seemed too busy with things that didn t matter to their guests rather disappointing
