room was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good i am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile
