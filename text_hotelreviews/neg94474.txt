the bathroom definitely needed to have a makeover the tiles in the shower were actually coming off as you showered the tap on the basin was also very loose breakfast was way too expensive for what you got i ve had better breakfasts elsewhere that were a lot cheaper you also had to eat quick on account of the food being cold you do get complimentary mini bar but what you actually get is free water and a bag of crisps hardly worth saying complimentary minibar you should say free bottles of water it would be more accurate i wouldn t say the hotel was any more than a hotel
