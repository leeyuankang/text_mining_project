room was a small room which did not seem to us to be within the range of room we purchased as represented on the website when the washbasin was used shaving hairs gurgled up we contacted reception the maintenance engineer attended quickly and advised that this was a major problem we are surprised that this problem had not been noted before had there not been the washbasin problem we would not have complained about the room as the receptionist indicated that the hotel was very busy but we would not have used the hotel again
