i didn t like that i selected a city view room and only had a view of the hotel across the street i could see the embankment underground station as well but very little of the city itself from my room i was not overly impressed with the comfort of the bed it was ok but i expected better the tv located inside the shower didn t work but i wasn t going to use it anyway
