we had booked rooms well in advance and requested that rooms had a walk in shower for my mum and mum in law also that all of the rooms were on the same floor when we arrived only room had a walk in shower and it was on the floor while the rest of the group was on the floor the lady checking us in was completely unsympathetic to why this was a problem when traveling with an older relative this is the second time in a row we have had an issue with the rooms i will think twice before i book to stay in this hotel again
