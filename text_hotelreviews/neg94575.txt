the housekeeping was very lacking out of nights we got turndown service once two days we returned to the room a pm and the room had not been cleaned i made coffee in the room and the next day it was not replenished you rarely could call housekeeping and get anyone to answer messages were left with housekeeping but you did not get what you had asked for very disappointing
