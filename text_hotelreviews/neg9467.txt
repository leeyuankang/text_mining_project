i m not usually one to write reviews but i am that unhappy and feel i need to warn people about how awful it is upon arrival the foyer was impressive it s a very beautiful building with art on the ceilings but unfortunately the rooms were a very different story the duvet cover had a big yellow stain on it so we had to ask for a clean one but when we tried to call down to reception the buttons on the phone had been pushed in so we couldn t use it and we didn t even get an apology there were dirty marks all up the walls and curtains we ordered an english breakfast with tea but the tea never arrived the gap between the wall and one side of the bed was about so no space to move our view was of other rooms at we were packing to leave when a member of staff just barged in despite check out being at not happy at all with this hotel especially as we paid a lot of money we would not stay here again
