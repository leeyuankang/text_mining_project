we may just have picked a very busy weekend the staff seemed overwhelmed with the volume of guests i had to collect my luggage from reception having been told it was being brought up and as i had an appointment to get to eventually i had to go get it myself i also had to wait hours for my room to be ready i did arrive early but had already asked for an early check in i am being very picky but there were a few little niggles that shouldn t be there in a star hotel
