breakfast staff didn t clear our table so used plates sat there and the table was very small nobody showed us where everything was laid out so for a moment we didnt know there was more till we went exploring in the next room bathroom this is what dropped our rating as it affected our comfort it seemed the people before us checled out late so cleaning was done in a hurry there were hairs stuck on the shower curtain and on the windowsill it made for a very uncomfortable bath time even after the hairs were cleaned out the following day i had an elastic band that snapped whes trying to tie up a bag in the morning it fell on yhe carpet and we were late so we rushed off returned in the evening room had been cleaned but elastic band was lying on yhe same spot on the carpet this hotel could be so much more than it is
