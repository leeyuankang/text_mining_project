there was an offer by the hotel on booking com when i chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date thinking i was wrong i repeated the process but again the same result so i ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date i called the hotel but they told me that i have to call booking com i called booking com but they told me i have to call the hotel what a trap
