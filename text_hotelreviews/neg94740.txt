i booked a deluxe room for a weekend half a year beforehand and asked a room with a nice view on the river we spent only nights in the hotel on our arrival we were given a room with a view on the roofs no spectacular view at all the room so small it was more like a cupboard the next day we were moved to another room with a view on the river the view was marvelous but the size of the room left much to be desired the biggest disappointment was our dinner at the restaurant at the hotel i ordered rib eye medium when i got it it was with blood the meat was nice and soft though i don t know what went wrong but next day i had a great problem with digestion we had to spend the whole afternoon and saturday evening in the hotel the next day was a torture to me as well and we came to london only for a weekend the weekend was ruined happily enough i could see london from my bed next time i will consider another hotel
