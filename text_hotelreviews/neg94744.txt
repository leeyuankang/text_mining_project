not a bad experience really just a quirk the heated towel rails are mounted very high on the wall and i could not reach the towels had to stand on the toilet to pull the towels down and lay them out elsewhere i contacted housekeeping and they put the towels on the counter one day but he other days the message apparently was missed overlooked so back up on the toilet seat to get the towels if one is average height or taller no problem but i m tall and it was inconvenient
