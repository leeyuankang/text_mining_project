the advertised docking systems for music either needs updating or at least removing from any advertising in neither of the two rooms we stayed in did it work however the most accommodating staff ensured that this issue was satisfactorily remedied during our stay being able to play my taste in music is an important issue for me but i do appreciate that it may not be equally important for other travellers
