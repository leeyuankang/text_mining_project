very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move the room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy it felt a like living in a basement furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps if your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it at that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already
