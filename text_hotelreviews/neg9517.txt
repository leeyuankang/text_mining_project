when i booked the room through booking com i thought i was going to have the superior room on arrival i was given the club room box the shower was so tight i was not able to turn round it was that tight the wardrobe was in the worst place by the door which was not helpful on entering the room i thought the cost of the room was expensive as it was not the room i had booked with booking com
