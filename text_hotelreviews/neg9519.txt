the room was really quite small but for per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location there was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc and the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until i covered it with a towel also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in there was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time
