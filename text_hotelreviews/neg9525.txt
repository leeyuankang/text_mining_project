against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best m as a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long a final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there
