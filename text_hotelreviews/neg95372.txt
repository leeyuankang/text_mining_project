it was one of the hottest days in the summer in london and there was no air flow through the room due to having a very small window i called down to reception and they brought up a jug of iced water but there was no fan in the room and the overnight concierge could not bring a spare one to us so we had a very uncomfortable nights sleep a great shame as providing a simple fan would have made our stay perfect
