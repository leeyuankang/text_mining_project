it was unfortunate that there was a heatwave in london at the time the first room was in the roof i e very hot no a c so asked to move to a room with a c this meant a move from a superior room to an executive room which meant more money but got a free upgrade in the end the only difference was the a c and size of bed the a c didn t work properly got that fixed and all was well the second night the executive room was disappointing in that it was small and dark
