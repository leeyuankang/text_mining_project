our room was tiny we had absolutely no room to change and kept getting in each other s way we had to move things out of the way to get to anything dire very disappointed lighting was poor for hair and makeup noise from the building site next door was loud from first thing in the morning most definitely not value for the price we were charged would not recommend for the above reasons
