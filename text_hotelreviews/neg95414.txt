upon arrival we were greeted and told we were too early to check in which we knew anyway we then didn t check in until as we were in the city all day we were given a room on the lower level which was below ground our room was actually situated right next to the kitchen and restaurant which was very noisy at the following morning as we were on the bottom level you could clearly hear the tube trains running underneath throughout the night our bed was also a pull out bed in a hotel which cost for one night we slept in a pull out bed overall awful experience for a hotel that we were expecting to be extremely nice
