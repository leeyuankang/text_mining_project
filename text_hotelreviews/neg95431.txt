the noise underground i asked via email not to be located around the between ground as i was scared to hear the underground see previous comments unfortunately they gave us a room and we could hear the underground from the room i was really disappointed it is really a pity because the room is super nice but for the price we paid hearing the underground every minute is really not normal they should at least verify with the client if it is okay
