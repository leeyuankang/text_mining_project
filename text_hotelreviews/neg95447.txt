rooms did not have air conditioning so we were far too hot even with windows open and two fans going all night i guess this is because it is an older property with thick walls felt like the heating was on full blast some rooms did have air con so if you go in the summer make sure you request it on the booking form we didn t as i don t usually like air con and don t mind the heat but this was unbearable probably great in the winter
