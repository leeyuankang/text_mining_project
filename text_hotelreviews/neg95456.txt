i would say that the hotel was slightly expensive for what you get though i stayed in a basement room and so there was little to no natural light our bed was extremely comfortable but it did clearly retract into the wall and so the pillows had a tendency to fall down the back of the bed which was less than ideal when trying to sleep factoring in the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the stay and that the additional charge for breakfast was extortionate we decided to eat elsewhere which was a shame as the restaurant menu looked fairly nice
