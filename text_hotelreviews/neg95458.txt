our stay at the fitzrovia was a frustrating one we booked a double room and initially the toilet did not work we called down and the staff instructed us how to fix it and later that evening the toilet was completely broken the next morning we were woken up to construction with no heads up about it we contacted the front desk in the morning regarding the toilet and construction and kindly asked to change rooms they told us to come down and they would sort it out once we came down we talked to the reception who told us we wouldn t be able to change rooms until at least an hour later this was after the took our room key for the room we had we explained to them that this was all very incovienent as we had literally woken up and headed right downstairs the reception then asked us if we had nothing else to do until our room was ready honestly this was insulting we are entitled to stay in our hotel room all day if we wanted to we asked about breakfast and the lady told us we could pay we sat in the lobby where we asked for a glass of water which did not come until over an hour later our room was ready the room we changed into was pretty much the same thing we emailed the manager of the hotel regarding this whole ordeal as the service was truly horrible we felt unappreciated unwelcomed and uncomfortable something that should not happen at a four star hotel the hotel manager called our room and then proceeded to apologise and said how she notices we were interested in the breakfast i am actually appalled i did not send an email to get a free breakfast but to ensure this service does not happen to any other guest very insulting the hotel itself is fine but the service is questionable will not be coming back
