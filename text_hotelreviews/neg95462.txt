we had a triple room booked we were given a fold out bed which was not fit for purpose it was a small fold out bed which was not long enough to accommodate an average height person and once you laid on it your bottom nearly touched the floor i would not accept this at a bed and breakfast never mind a four star hotel it took me an hour and minutes to sort this out which made me miss an event i was due to attend early afternoon i am still chasing them up as i requested a reduction in room rate however they said they needed to speak to booking com on monday so i would have to pay full rate and they would then consider a refund after speaking to yourselves i asked that the manager call me on monday to discuss the awful experience and they did not call me i had to call them and they said they are still reviewing and don t know when they can come back to me i insisted i be given a date by which they call me back so they agreed to end of day wednesday in addition to the bed the room was very tired broken handles on bedside cabinet and stained wall lights as well as air conditioning vents in the ceiling caked with dust i would urge you to inspect this property as it really does not come up to standard it was not stated in the booking com website that the third bed may be a pull out camp bed which is what they are now claiming as of yesterday however when i complained on arrival they said that they were fully booked and that was all they could offer the communal corridors are over heated and feel like a sauna
