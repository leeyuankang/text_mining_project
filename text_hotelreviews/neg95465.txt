checking in was slow because of computer problems so we were upgraded to an executive room but the bathroom light didn t work there so we had to move again but were back in an ordinary room i think also the kettle was in a cupboard with a flap down door and in one room it fell on my husband s hand and in the second room it fell on my head a design fault i fancy we mentioned this when we left
