the room was incredibly noisy all night i had booked this as part of my parents wedding anniversary weekend i d emailed the hotel or times previous to their arrival to explain why they were staying the hotel assured me they would take extra care of them and make it special they didn t and there was no acknowledgement of their anniversary i would expect more care from a establishment
