considering this was titled as a superior double room priced at to start with my thoughts were if this is supposed to be a superior room don t think i d like to stay in a standard room really didn t feel that it was worth the money luckily i only ended up paying it was a fold out double bed there were old stains on the pillow where the room was situated felt as though i was in the service quarters a very scruffy building at the very back of my room was my view from my window if i have a choice next time i don t think i would stay there again
