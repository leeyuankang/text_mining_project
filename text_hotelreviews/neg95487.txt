the first room i was checked into room has a pull down double bed and no bedside lights just very bright overhead room lights this is clearly an old storage room that has been put into service not acceptable as a room to sleep in when paying over per night even in london with no breakfast felt like someone s closet overlooked airconditioning units and service pipes outside next room they placed me in was a bit dusty and you could clearly hear the tube line underground near by every minutes and the noise from the internal hour bar but i was too tired by that time to care sharp the next morning jackhammers on the next door wall next door building made everything in the room rattle and the noise was unacceptable levels without ear protection i called the manager into the room to experience the sound she admitted that she did not realise it was so bad they honestly should not be allowed to use that room while the construction takes place next door i had work to prepare for a meeting that morning the manager showed me their business centre which is a closet sized room with one monitor and a printer but was occupied for hours in the main lobby there are couches but with cleaners vacuuming at they moved me to a third room that night while i was out at work this was at the other end of the building upstairs it was cold but ok i could hear the jackhammers again at the next morning but they were a manageable sound level although outside bin collections etc were very noisy the hotel is in a lovely old building but it is clear that the owners do not care at all about their guest s comfort there is a lot of internal and external noise and the old rooms have not been properly soundprrofed the bedding carpets curtains are old and dusty the bathrooms that i used had broken shower slides and shower heads that were not very good
