so disgusting that they didnt change the sheets should have thought that a star hotel would put on clean sheets especially because we asked for it by hanging the sign on the door please make up the room even though the hotel wasnt fully booked they gave us a bad room just above the tube so i had trouble sleeping and was woken up early both saturday and sunday not really what i expected for the price and a star hotel
