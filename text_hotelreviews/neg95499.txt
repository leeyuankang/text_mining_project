small room with very bad soundproofing we were able to hear the conversations happening in the corridor or even in the room next to us we had neighbours very noisy there was no system of air circulation but a small window that could be opened only for a few centimeters breakfast is not worth its price for the same place you can have good quality food outside a fews blocks from the hotel bread and viennoiserie were dry not many choice there is a heating issue room was cold but corridor very hot should fix that
