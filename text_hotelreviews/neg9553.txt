we arrived at royale hotel at hyde park where they took my payment for the room it was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in paddington they paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in mins however we were made to wait mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be the hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable
