room far too hot even on a moderately warm day small window locked in position that only allowed a few inches of opening and made the small room feel very claustrophobic as well as hot electric fan provided and used constantly but fans don t really cool the room comfortably if there is no air conditioning it should not be allowed for hotels to lock windows in a semi closed position this one thing ruined my stay and i would only go back in winter
