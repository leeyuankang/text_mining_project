upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted she told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked we did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small when entering the room i immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls my partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat i turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so i ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust after informing the front desk and upon return to our room i was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned i decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath i had to annoyingly fiddle with it then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until i forced it to pull back out on my first night i had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out i proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided after i finished writing i turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration we looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at however we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed my partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish
