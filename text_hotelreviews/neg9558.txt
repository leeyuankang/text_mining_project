do not order room service we ordered two panini s in the evening one cheese chicken and the other cheese pepperoni this was to come with a side salad and crisps this was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy however when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side it looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived i took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look i said i have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh i dont know how a panini should look i dont eat them this wasnt really the response i was hoping for so just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed
