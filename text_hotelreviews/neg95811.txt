i was charged euro more at checkout than was stated on my booking when i questioned it the receptionist looked flustered and said she didn t know why and made me look like an idiot i paid anyway because my taxi was waiting i am following this up with booking com i asked for a room with a view and got one facing a wall but they changed it to a street view after i asked housekeeping didn t bother to clean any dirty glasses or my sheets the bathroom sink leaked onto the floor be careful how you get out of bed because you may hit your head on the wall it s that cramped at either side of the bed ask for a street view it s more vibrant and the windows cut out all noise
