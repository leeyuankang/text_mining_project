a little more interaction with you on arrival my first visit to paris from australia so was keen to know things they were simply focused on getting me processed rather than suggesting anything this is quite a normal french approach so ask questions room did not have a corkscrew or any cutlery or wine glasses you can get by asking at the desk and be prepared all wine has corks unlike australia remember to book at least in advance for transport shuttle to the airport difficult and expensive cost euros to get a taxi shuttle was euros and was a good service
