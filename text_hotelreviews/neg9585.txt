although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window if this was the upgrade i dread to think what our original room would have been like for a star hotel and the amount we paid i would not have expected any of these things
