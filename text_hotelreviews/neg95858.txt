the room was extremely small and we were there with a baby and the baby crib took all the space on the floor the hotel was very empty so really surpriced that they didn t give us a bigger room to give id a better experience we go to paris once or twice a year and have stayed at the same hotel for the past years and this was the first time we tried a new hotel
