upon arrival we had to wait minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our suitcases up the stairs into the reception area we had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of people one of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other we asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it we had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets we found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair we accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet they gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room when we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday my card was overcharged by when i had checked out when i rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank when i called my bank they had given me preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it the manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank they are highly unprofessional and i will never ever stay at this hotel again it is appauling and disgusting
