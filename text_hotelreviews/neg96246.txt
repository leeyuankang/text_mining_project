a few things firstly i asked for half pints of heineken at the bar and was told it would cost i handed over my card and the waitress took it over to the other side of the bar did contactless without asking and actually charged me i later found out she was messing around with my card and chatting to people she even dropped it down the side of the till at one point so i ve actually cancelled my card just in case the other issue was i was woken up at by water pouring through the air conditioning room i had to put towels down and obviously it wasn t ideal when i mentioned this when i checked out the girl didn t really seem bothered they were far more pleasant and friendly on check in
