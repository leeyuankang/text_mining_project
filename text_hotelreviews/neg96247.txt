the toilet and shower were positioned within a glass cubicle with coated glass the lighting depth and colour could be changed which is a fun feature but i would suggest that if you were a little shy of natural ablutions this is not the space for you possibly a little too intimate maybe that s an english thing maybe worth checking to see if all rooms are the same the sink was positioned in the main room area it sounds odd but it does work the shower provided good pressure and hot water
