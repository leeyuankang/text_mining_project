you couldn t open the window in the room so it felt like there was a lack of natural air which is something that i am personally not keen on however every thing else was great so it didn t take away from the enjoyment although i might think twice if i was staying in london for more than a couple of nights also just one small point for couples maybe more for new couples the loo and shower is just an kind of pod in the room so not a proper bath room so perhaps a bit close for comfort if you are travelling with someone you are not completely at ease with
