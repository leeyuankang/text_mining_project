the room was quite small but perfectly formed would have liked some room at window side of bed also no space to walk around the bed also no baths a bath would have been nice after a day of sightseeing also didn t like the sight of a white ceramic dish with a ceramic gun sitting in it too threatening an icon for such a welcoming hotel
