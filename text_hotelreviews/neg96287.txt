as a primarily single traveller woman retired i have noticed over the last years of solo travel the lack of customer service offered by young women primarily wait staff as in bar or restaurant staff in this night stay i encountered different women working in the bar and different men working in the bar i usually have a pre dinner prosecco and a post dinner prosecco or tea as well as morning coffee i was served times at the bar four were positive as in acknowledge me even when serving someone else men and woman the other three were no one else being served but a she can wait attitude no greeting and surly service i am a pleasant person and i am not interested in chatting with wait staff about my day just want to place my order and be provided with wait service the last service that i received after attending the theatre made me realize that i am unwilling to remain silent if a man treated me in the manner in which the young woman served my after theatre prosecco i would have said he was a misogynist i concluded the young woman took exception to the fact that i am a white older woman i was not greeted the woman reluctantly left her conversation with another client at the bar who was young and male and halfway through his beverage poured the glass of prosecco did not fill the glass regarded me intently and took my payment all without speaking one word although two other women had provided surly service none had provided me with service without speaking a word i already knew the cost of the beverage and had my cash payment ready got it ready while i was waiting for service i was feet from the other customer and did not ask to be served i made eye contact with the wait staff and waited i made a complaint the next morning giving the time of my purchase to the front desk staff who apologized and expressed concern unfortunately i did not bother to read the name tag
