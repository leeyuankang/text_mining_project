the pod style room room was functional but small although not a problem for one night main issue though was the bed although very big and comfortable it literally took up one whole side of the room so the person sleeping on the inside had to climb over the other to get out we managed ok but obviously this could be problem for some people hence the only reason i have marked it down on comfort obviously they may not all be like this so would ask also although there were cold drinks and snacks on the house which was nice it is always good to have tea and coffee making facilities although don t think there would have been room
