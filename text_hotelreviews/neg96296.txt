room very small and cramped bed squashed against wall which wasn t ideal for getting in and out of bed it felt like being in a tiny caravan our city view was a view of the rooms opposite so needed to keep blind down for privacy hence making the room dark hardly any staff around very minimalistic no tea and coffee facilities in room although a mini bar with a few very strange drinks that were not to our liking the bathroom was a toilet and shower in a cubicle which wasn t very private and the basin was in the bedroom very bizarre hotel and not certainly worth the money
