if you are looking for spacious rooms with good facilities then this is not the hotel for you the room was very small indeed the room is the width of the bed and the toilet and shower facilities were behind a glass screen door rather than in a separate bathroom space was at such a premium that the sink was actually in the bedroom there was no room to store suitcases other than on the floor and no enclosed clothes hanging space merely a clothes rail with very limited hanging space on arriving in our room we found that there are no tea coffee facilities a major omission but there is a fridge stocked with a limited range of soft drinks however the fridge was not working and we reported this to a member of staff to no avail many of the innovative features in the room are operated through an ipad blinds temperature lights tv but the tablet would not hold its charge indeed after an all day charge it was still holding less than a charge which meant that it lasted barely a few hours before it needed recharging making it almost useless this is not a hotel that i would stay in again
