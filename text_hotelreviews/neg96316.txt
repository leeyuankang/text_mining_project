we were at the front of the hotel on a low floor and it was really noisy you could hear everything outside and even though it was a sunday night it sounded like building works were going on all night they did offer us to change room but by then our baby was asleep and waking her to move would have been even more trouble rooms are very small and beds not great if there are of you as one of you has to climb over the other to get out of bed
