the rooms are very small i booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one i had there was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed the fire alarm went off at not the hotel s fault but the following night i was kept awake by faulty door chimes which i couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club
