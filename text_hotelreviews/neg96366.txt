the control of all the lights and blinds using the ipad was heavily over engineered it proved impossible for us to switch on one or two of the lights without using the ipad although there were wall switches i could switch lights off physically but not on there was only a single bed side light which meant that one of us could read at night but not the other for some reason it was also impossible to switch off the aircon so there was a cool breeze blowing over us all night even with the temperature set at a maximum perhaps this was a fault with the equipment
