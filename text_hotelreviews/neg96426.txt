the impressions made by the website arrival into the lobby public areas set you up for high expectations unfortunately it falls flat once you head upstairs the corridors are dark dusty despite a hoover being left in the corridor with the cables all over the floor causing a porential trip hazzard further disappointed in the bedroom a small box with a platform bed surrounded on sides by walls glass up one end no space to walk around so you have to clamber up over the bed the way it is set up there is only one bedside light no windows to open you have to keep the blinds curtains down for privacy causing more of a claustrophobic feeling the shower unit is more like a steam room as soon as you take a shower causing the toilet paper towels to become damp cold water dripping from the roof on top of this the room had not been dusted properly with dust on the glass shelves mirror the room was not at all inviting or enticing to stay in no matter how much gadgetry there is oh check your docking station when cleaning the room so that the ipad is charged enough to operate the room facilities
