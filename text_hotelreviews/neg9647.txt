deluxe double was a very small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on floor so when i was in shower i nearly hit my head on ceiling and i m only foot there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however i would rate this a star
