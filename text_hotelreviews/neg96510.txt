i d like the food to be charged per plate rather then salad v hot becasue i like salad with my small portion of hot food but the good news is they charged me a basic anyway which was kind but i felt like i couldn t ask them to do that the next time so i ate out instead i d also like an option to make the room cooler than degrees
