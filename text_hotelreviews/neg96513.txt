my only complaint would be you can t switch off the damn acs in the room the ac would be working all night while i would be sleeping and my sinuses weren t the happy campers the staff offered to cover the ac vent with paper such a major architectural flaw the reason why the ac doesn t switch off is because the windows don t open the reason why the windows don t open is because the bed is right against the glass window and the architect didn t think people would ever want natural ventilation this really bugged me considering i was on holiday and the last thing i wanted to do was get sick in london and deal with sinus medication and headaches
