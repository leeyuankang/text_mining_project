where do i begin i am confused as to the glowing online reviews of this hotel the website photos are very misleading yes the lobby is all trendy and hipster chic but a bit gimmicky in our opinion this is a hotel where people go to stay sleep and relax and this is where it is an absolute let down the hotel rooms are more akin to mini pods and we feel that the website does not clearly explain their meagre proportions we absolutely would not have stayed here if we had realised that people would be unable to move around the room at the same time the bed was large yes but nightime toilet trips required one person to climb precariously over the other as the bed had one exit side not recommended for anyone of a feeble disposition the lighting in the room was controlled by an in room i pad all colours of the rainbow were available but we felt the effect was bordering on weird especially the brothel toned red hue a note to hypochondriacs planning on staying here no you are not suffering from a kidney disorder your urine amongst other things will be an alarming shade of red due to the room s lighting effects there was nowhere to kick back and relax in the room after a long day s sightseeing so we tended to stay out as long as possible we subsequently spent the reminder of our trip gazing longingly at other cheaper hotels we could have stayed at whose dimensions would allow free movement of non lilliputians
