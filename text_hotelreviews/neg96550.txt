tap in bathroom was very loose instructions for high tech controls in room should have been pointed out at reception they were great but we didnt find the switch for the blinds until morning breakfast was great very informal and lots of food the coffee system was slow and shouting names out from the bar was not the best system issuing table numbers and bringing the coffee to the table would have been better
