while i don t see the need for huge hotel rooms this was just a little too small i didn t like the bathroom sink being outside the bathroom or having to climb over my husband in bed to get to the bathroom at night and i hated not being able to make a tea or a coffee in the room especially first thing in the morning but my overall impression was very good and i would come back as it was good value given the location
