i hadn t realised the room was so tiny ie the size of the bed and little else i had something deducted from my room bill that appeared on my credit card and the staff couldn t tell me what it was for i didn t ask for any breakfasts and had nothing from the mini bar but it still appeared on my bill i wonder how often that happens it was less than pounds so not worth fussing about but very annoying
