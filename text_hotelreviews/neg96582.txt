the location while well placed in the southwark district close to several pubs and restaurants does require a bit of a walk to get to the nearest tube stations and to any major attraction that may be inconvenient if you are travelling alone and plan to go out late i never felt unsafe walking the empty streets in the late hours of the night because my husband was always with me but would have probably not felt comfortable doing it alone
