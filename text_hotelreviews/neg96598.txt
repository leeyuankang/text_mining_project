the location was not super close to the main attractions it required a bit of a walk which wasn t too bad as it was close to restaurants and shopping markets we actually stayed at citizenm twice in two weeks the first stay was flawless the second stay we actually had to change rooms because the pad was locked up and none of the controls were working properly and also the water did not get refilled after the first day minor things compared to the great experience with the staff and at the bar
