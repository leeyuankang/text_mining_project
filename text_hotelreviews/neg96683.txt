although a number of tube options are available if you ve been sight seeing and pounding the streets all day the hotel can feel a bit of a slog to get back to not so keen on the cabin bed effect which means in all the rooms there is only one side of the bed you can get out of not much fun clambering over your partner in the night there is a lack of view with a gallery effect layout and the use of blinds and black outs screening you from your neighbours opposite i didnt like the lack of in room tea coffee making facilities its the first thing i reach for in the morning although the staff were really helpful i didnt really like the self service check in out its bad enough at tesco self service can be convenient and despite best attempts not to be so it felt a bit impersonal annonymous like an unncessary attempt to seperate staff from customers
