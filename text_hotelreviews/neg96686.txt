the trays used to carry breakfast were a bit small i like to spread out my food on different plates and the limited space on the tray made this tricky i work out so don t judge yeah that s my biggest complaint not really a complaint but word of caution hotel rooms in london are smaller than in other cities this is no exception but they make really good use of space also the windowns don t open again not so uncommon there but on the bright side the ac is quite good so not that big of a problem
