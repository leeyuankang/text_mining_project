we were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working the alternate hotel is advertised as star i don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other star rated hotels i have stayed in it does not meet the high standard expected of a star the bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average it was a real disappointment
