my tv and the tablet did not communicate with one another and i was unable to access that function in my room it was frustrating and disappointing as i would have loved to watch something at night i also found a long black hair on my bed and it had no relation to anyone i allowed into my room which made me feel like the place wasn t cleaned properly and made me hope that my sheets were clean the hotel has no room service which is also slightly annoying there was no separation of all the lights being on or none so it was quite a harsh wake up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night
