annoying to have to pay gbp for doing the check in yourself or for paying with credit card it wasn t very clear it seemed the room temperature couldn t be regulated properly and we couldn t have a less heavy blanket so sleep was really uncomfortable the staff did what they could but the only alternative to the heavy blanket was a simple bed sheet as the saying goes all or nothing the room is very small and claustrophobic and the bed is accessible only on one side it looks like a very big dog basket on the other hand the bathroom was very big and this actually doesn t make any sense
