although i can see what they re trying to do with the rooms i feel they re just a bit too small and clostrophobic for a couple and having the toilet and shower in such close proximity isn t great when you re both trying to get ready the majority of the movies were dated so we d seen them already i also think as it s located in london england obviously it just doesn t seem right that there s no tea or coffee making facilities
