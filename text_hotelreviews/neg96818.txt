the room was tiny we had a very comfortable king size bed and i slept well but the bed took up nearly the entire room for two people there was virtually no storage aside from a single drawer built into the bed and a tiny closet nowhere to put belongings aside from shoving them to the sides of the room as best we could it was like an asian sleep pod given the small size of the combined toilet and shower and that the walls were translucent there was little left to the imagination if someone were using the bathroom i think rooms our size are best suited for single travelers
