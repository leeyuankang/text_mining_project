room was a bit chilly and as with most hotels they never have temperature controls you can see or understand how they work thought it was strange that the lifts are super silent you hardly know you re moving but the room doors self close and there s nothing you can do to stop them banging really loudly when they close the reception is now what used to be a great bar right on the triangle corner of the building and i miss it i used to drink there occasionally even when not staying at the hotel you could watch the world go by on the seven dials from all sides
