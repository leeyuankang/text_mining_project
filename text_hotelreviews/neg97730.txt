please lower the volume of the music in the dining area it was just possible to hear what the waiter told about the food too noisy for me to enjoy the good food in my room i was no able to switch off the air conditioner i stayed off for a while but then started again i felt cold during the night as it did neither keep the temperature as i set is perhaps i was just clumsy
