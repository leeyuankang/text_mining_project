tv s have a limit on the volume and it was so far away from the bed which meant we couldn t hear it at all once the heat was switched on the most frustrating thing was the lack of hot water and water pressure in the sink and shower taking a shower in a cold bathroom which only ever got luke warm with such little pressure was a very uncomfortable way to start the day it s a given for me that a hotel should have hot water and decent pressure so this was a big negative point
