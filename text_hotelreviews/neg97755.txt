this hotel and the staff were fantastic my only negative for feedback to the hotel was that in my room the long mirror in the bedroom was on the back of the bathroom door so there was only a metre to stand back and look in it and the area was dark right beside the door i was preparing for a big event so would have preferred a mirror located somewhere better with more space and light it was perfect in the room my friends were in though everything else was perfect
