we had not water on arrival so could not use showers toilets etc really this was the only thing that let them down also i requested adjoining interconnecting rooms when i booked i was only told the day before this was not available but the alternative offered by the hotel was acceptable i don t think that this would be the case if we were staying longer otherwise excellent but a bit pricey
