no dedicated area for residents to have a drink or eat given where it is i can understand the desire to encourage passing trade but it makes it very difficult for residents to access the bar for a drink or to get a table to eat also there is really insufficient space in the dining area certainly at breakfast being seated at a bar table which is far too small to eat breakfast from is disappointing given the cost of the hotel
