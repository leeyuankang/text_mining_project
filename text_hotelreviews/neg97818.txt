bar seating was uncomfortable and service was just standard ordered a baileys to drink and it came warm with no ice had to ask for some there are building works going on which wasn t a problem but reception area looked very stark and bland in comparison to the last time we stayed a couple of years ago we were put in a tiny box room next to the lift and there was very little natural light we asked if we could be moved to a different room but had to pay for an upgrade which we did and the room was acceptable
