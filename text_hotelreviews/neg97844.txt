there were nine of us in the group so it took quite a while to get checked in i know its possible to check in on line but i did not have everyones personal information to do this also one thing the key card has to be waved in front of the lift numbers which they did not make clear we were all busy trying to make the lift work pressing floor numbers and going no where until another guest showed us how to do it its obvious to the staff but not to guests unless made very clear at check in this is what is needed
