i was a bit disappointed that the hotel did not recognise the fact that it was my daughters birthday even although it was noted on the file i was only looking for a very small gesture in the room to mark the occasion but it was simply forgotten about perhaps due to the fact that the hotel was having some major refurbishment during our stay in a way i think it should have been even more important at this time this was pretty disruptive however the staff were very courteous and cheerful and the location excellent if they had recognised the birthday as they said they would i would have scored
