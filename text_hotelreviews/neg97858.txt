unfortunately when we arrived the restaurant was in the process of being refurbished we were unaware of this at time of booking or prior to arrival full disclosure an email was sent approx weeks before arrival but went to my spam folder as a result there was no food available beyond tea coffee and croissants with location available to eat or facility to take back to the room the lobby was dusty due to the works to the extent that i dirtied my shirt and also one of the two small lifts was out of order meaning that it often took mins to use the lifts
