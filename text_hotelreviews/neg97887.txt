the twin room we were allocated was far inferior to double rooms we have stayed in in this hotel it was poky and had a safe you could not even open unless you moved it and there was no room in the cupboard for an ironing board we were not warned about this the person at reception on our arrival was unfriendly and tried to pre charge us for expenses without asking if we wanted this
