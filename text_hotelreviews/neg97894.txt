twice requested a twin room as travelling with adult daughter i telephoned the hotel albeit i think a call centre as well also requested early check in as we had an early flight neither of which we received bit disappointing as it was booked as early as january was simply told at reception that others had requested twin room as well we did get a twin room on the second night and a lovely little cake as we were celebrating our joint birthdays
