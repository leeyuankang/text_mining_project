the tv did not work had to request an engineer but due to this being late in the day we were not able to enjoy this whilst we were getting ready to go out also i wasted time trying to work out why it wasn t working etc which wasn t easy as it was pinned to the wall the duty manager working that day appeared to be sympathetic but was not prepared to offer us any kind of incentive to come back to the hotel so i am sorry to say this will be the first and last time we will book the radisson anywhere
