i had to pay for an upgrade to get what i already paid for the room booked was supposed to have a bath however only a shower was available when asking about it i was told that i am out of luck because not all rooms have the bath as advertised and i would have to buy an upgrade so basically i had to pay double their satisfaction guarantee is a joke apparently the room service breakfast was more that minutes late and they forgot essential items of the order had to call multiple times and the restaurant chef excused himself saying that a lot of people ordered breakfast i would have expected them to be experienced enough to handle that
