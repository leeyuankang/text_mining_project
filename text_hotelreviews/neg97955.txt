for the price the room a deluxe double was a bit tatty floor stains chipped wood hairs scattered around and it was tiny but you re paying solely for location here staff were pleasant and the room was quiet but this is the second london radisson blu i ve stayed at and the chain seems to favour style over substance weird music in the lifts and weird art and statues but little signage ie reception this way wouldn t stay again usually stay at the marrioty canary wharf but went to ronnie scott s late show and this was close by
