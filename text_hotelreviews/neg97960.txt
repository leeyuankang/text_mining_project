our room is quite small not much of extra space for huge luggage also we don t like the steps right before and after our bedroom door and also the lift lobby too tedious for us to move our luggage up and down cost is considered quite on the high side as we can find better hotel with the same price the reason we booked this was because of our new year countdown venue which was within walking distance so it would be convenient for us to walk back as the tube service was temporarily closed
