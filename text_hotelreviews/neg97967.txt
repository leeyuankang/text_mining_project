unfortunately we were woken up in the middle of the first night of our stay by a funny noise that sounded like a drill i rang and reported it but they were unsure what it was then later the fire alarm went off we had to all leave and as we were sent back to our rooms it went off again this was unfortunate because the same thing happened to us in a different one of your hotels last year
