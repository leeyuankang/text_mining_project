the room was supposedly a superior double but it was tiny and the bed was a normal double i e very small for a modern and very expensive hotel i didn t know that double beds came smaller than king size in modern hotels we got a bad nights sleep because of this it was also not just pricey but extraordinarily expensive for what you got i paid more than you would for a standard room for this superior one so i hate to think what they are like there was barely room to walk around the bed in ours
