during this stay we found a lot of noise from the staff as they went in and out of the next room each time they went in or out they just left the room door to slam as this could start quite early in the morning and we were on a leisure trip it really did disturb us we mentioned this at reception but they seemed to think it was a guest this was not the case as we made a point of checking who was letting the door slam this is the first time we have had a problem whilst staying at this hotel
