tiny room and tiny shower toilet area pathetically small bed the blind was not adequate and let a lot of light into the room could not turn the air con on the sink was blocked and water would not go down the plug hole quickly the first room we were offered someone had been smoking in it and it smelt awful we were offered another room which smelt better but we had to wait an hour for it we were also offered an upgrade for extra as there was only a suite free at the time a bad experience in all we had a great stay in london other than the hotel
