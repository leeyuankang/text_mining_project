got charged for a birthday package when it was advertised for on the website this was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of the shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use we were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower couldn t check us into our room at had to wait extra minutes standard breakfast was very expensive at i highly suggest not to buy cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend
