my stay was made stressful due to almost every member of staff being not to a standard this type of hotel should have day before arrival i rang times to confirm my booking even the duty manager wasn t able to until a heated argument started then they felt they had to make an effort heh presto they found it calls that where promised to be returned after investigation never came went on from in the morning to in the evening after departing i had x follow up calls due to my complaints from managers who couldn t even get my name right i then got follow up emails addressing me by a different name the breakfast was terrible being served simply scrambled eggs on toast the toast only slice was served min before the eggs asking for more warm toast it never arrived after hr i left went elsewhere for breakfast that was after being charged on a follow up for this complaint the f b manager told me the toaster was faulty he would buy me a drink in the bar if i ever returned to their hotel which i won t the mini bar was totally empty in the bedroom but i had to leave a deposit by card on reception at point of check in so made me worry i was going to be charged will be checking my bank statements after days after departure my invoice from them as requested for final bills has still not been received when ordering room service at the bar to be sent up i had to explain times to the bar tender as he couldn t grasp the fact i wanted it in the room not in the bar i could go on on but i think anyone reading would be fed up by that point very very disappointed in the standard of staff particularly management i was only there nights
