the room was incredibly small we had no room to keep our suitcases in the room we had to empty our clothes into a tiny closet and store our suitcases under the sink in the bathroom the double bed mattress was poor the air conditioning unit in the room had a hose out the window so the window had to sty open not good when it was raining mould in the bathroom we ve stayed in earl s court before and love the location and do not expect anything but a smallish room but this was quite unbelievable
