disappointed to find that room was at basement level there were patio doors opening on to a small courtyard but this meant that it was not possible to leave a window door open at night and as the weather was very warm this was not particularly nice apart from this the hotel was fine but i would definitely not want a basement room next time i would be happy to stay here again as it is a very pleasant location for exploring london
