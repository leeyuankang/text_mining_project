never n again the mezzanine room was sub standard it was located in the building next door locks didn t operate well which was frustrating as we had to open doors before getting into the room the heating could not be turned off on the hottest day of the year when we returned to the room at midnight discovered this at am and tried to manage this situation instead of walking out of the building with my daughter complained in the morning prior to having the worst buffet breakfast we had to compete with the staff for food as they were clearing the table and licking their knives in glee they then pushed pass our table to go outside for cigarettes the smoke then wafted in whilst we finished our breakfast i have communicated with the manager who ignored my last phone call and communication as i asked for of the cost to be refunded i thought this was fair as we had the most horrific nights sleep but he refused stating that they could have resolved the issue at am let s start moving rooms sorting out the problem at am hotels need to know that this is unaccepatable service i would not recommend this place to anyone it is a shabby place trying to look good
