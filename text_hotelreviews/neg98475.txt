the receptionist when i arrived was harassed and muddled perhaps because inexperienced untrained the fitted carpet in my room was wet because it had been washed that day i was not warned about this the room was advertised as luxury a minimum condition of luxury must be more space in the room than a narrow strip round the bed and enough shelf space in the bathroom not to have to juggle one s gear a number of food items that were part of the buffet breakfast arrived on both days i was there twenty minutes after the start of breakfast if you want a cup of tea before breakfast as i do because i get up early you have to go downstairs to get it as there is no room service at that time it would be much easier to provide tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom
