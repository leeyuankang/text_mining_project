food was very good quality but there wasn t much of it dining room was tiny crowded and noisy coffee tea machine was not working properly for the cost of the room the standards were rather below expectation given that coffee and tea came through the same spout on the machine the coffee tasted somewhat tea like we were in room a four poster that turned out to be in the basement room was nice but rather noisy given that it is at the front of the building street noise also hallway noise as this is where staff converge to organise cleaning laundry hoovering etc woken up before with chatter outside the door room was ok but location in the building not good for expected much more strangely there were certain things not in room something as basic as a box of tissues for instance plug in the sink is broken so my husband couldn t fill up the sink to shave little things but they do undermine the experience overall
