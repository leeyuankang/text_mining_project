for me the biggest disappointment was that there were no facilities to make tea in the bedroom i was told i could order it from room service at any time when i did that at in the morning i was told there was no one to bring it as it was sunday i had to get dressed go downstairs get the tea and come back upstairs and get back into bed not a really relaxing sunday morning which i was looking forward to would not have minded so much but asked specifically and was told i could get tea anytime
