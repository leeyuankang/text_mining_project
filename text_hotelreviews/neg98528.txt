temperature in small double was above degrees c in february only solution offered was the advice to open the window this opened to a shared balcony fire exit structure which enabled easy access to intruders i hardly slept the nights i spend there staff was polite but did not offer solutions they advised me to contact the hotel manager via mail he reacted a week later and clearly did not care at all this is a well known problem in this hotel i heard other guests who were offered another room against extra costs apart from the heat the room was very basic no chair no working space
