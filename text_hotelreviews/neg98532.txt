there were a few things i would like to see improved the windows are single glaze and difficult to open and shut therefore a lot of draft gets in and you need the extra thick curtains to try and stem this the fireplace we did not use but would have been nice to have the option no lighter in the room no plugs near the bed ash tray on the balcony not emptied i was under the impression smoking was not allowed anyway in hotels even on a balcony the room is in another building featuring peoples mail on the side as you enter and in a dimly lit entrance way the doors are locked by single key security of swipe cards not used and the fact you need keys to get into your room is not great one for the front door one for the hotel rooms and one for your room you only get one set too which is not great for a couple as most hotels give room service is not available in the suite
