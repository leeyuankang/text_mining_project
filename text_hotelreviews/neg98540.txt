unfortunately the suite was not warm enough there was an extra heater but really small for the suite and even if it was not that cold was not warm enough in a that expensive suite i was expecting everything to be perfect but was not the windows are not closing properly and the room is not warm enough to be relaxed also the breakfast was ok not ok for an english hotel miserable bad for a european one i had much richer breakfast in two star hotels in italy and france not either dare to mention the differences with equal star hotels in other will countries or even middle east countries like dubai but for uk was ok
