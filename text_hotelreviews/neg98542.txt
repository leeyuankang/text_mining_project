i was in the solarium which i deliberately had not booked and which is in the next door building i did not feel comfortable with this as a lone female traveller as far as i knew i was the only person in the building at night the entrance to the main hotel is excellent but next door was stark with junk mail on the floor a socket in the main room would have been helpful the only ones were in a very small corner of the ante room and difficult to access
