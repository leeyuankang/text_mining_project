worst stay in my five years of business travel hotel was booked and paid for by my company for business purposes upon arrival to the hotel i was told i could not check in without the same card that paid for the room but as this was done via my organisation i did not have that card on my person the booking was in my name however and i offered my passport driving licence and alternative credit cards all of which were refused as an alternative i also had a printed document with authorisation from my company for the card use yet the receptionist still demanded to see the card itself before deciding to accuse me of identity theft because i did not have the card this debacle lasted for about half an hour before the receptionist eventually said that my company could send over a faxed copy of the card and a filled out copy of his specific credit card authorisation form with a business booking it is extremely common not to have the card used to pay for the room and usually proof of authorisation which i had or an alternative card which i had is accepted instead in my five years of travelling for business i have never experienced such a rude and accusatory service and after miles of driving to get there it was not at all what i wanted to be greeted with unfortunately the story does not end there i was eventually allowed up to my room on the proviso that my company would be faxing through the information in the next hour only to then get trapped in the very small lift for several minutes before finally making it to the top floor this was not the only thing that did not appear to be functioning correctly as when i arrived in the room the window was wide open it was the middle of a frosty day in january and upon trying to close the window i realised why it was open it was broken as the latch was hanging off
