cosy when i got in on a cold january afternoon by room was stuffy and a bit too hot to sleep no visible heating controls in room and radiatior wasn t on so i opened window then had to close again as it was degrees outside better hot than cold i suppose in january so not a big minus apart from that there was a lack of places to put things no table etc but i m being picky it was great value friendly and very convenient
