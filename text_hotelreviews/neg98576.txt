alhough the staff were always happy to provide hot drinks i would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room and also some slippers i don t know anyone these days who uses trouser presses perhaps the hotel could provide an iron and ironing board instead the building is quite old and creaky and one can hear a lot of noise from outside in the corridors and from adjoining rooms my room was downstairs in the basement next to a service room and i could hear the staff unlocking the door moving cleaning equipment about etc extremely clearly this didn t really bother me but it might be something that would affect noise sensitive people it s possible that the rooms on the top floor are quieter
