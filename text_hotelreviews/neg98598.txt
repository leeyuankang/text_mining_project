i have been a regular client here for several years and have written very favourable reviews previously on this site my stay on oct was to be the third in weeks contributing to their income in that period however instead of receiving a warm welcome as a loyal customer i was met with a demand for photographic id this requirement had been introduced by the new owners i was told after some heated discussion i requested to see the manager but he refused to leave his office a more placatory receptionist came on duty and remembered me from previous visits but still insisted on id even though the room had already been paid for so if you enjoy being treated disagreeably and with disdain then this is the place for you if not try one of the other london hotels
