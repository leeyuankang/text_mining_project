the room was quirky but definitely not star the toilet door would not close the room was extremely hot and the fan did not work in spite of asking for it to be fixed there was no sound proofing so when people went into their room nearby or above us it was as if there were walking through our room as a result we had little sleep for nights which is not a good way to visit any city the room was also tiny chairs had to be moved to access the wardrobe in my opinion this was certainly not a four star hotel but rather a quirky somewhat over priced b b
