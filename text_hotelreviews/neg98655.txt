the very first words spoken to us as we arrived were not hello or welcome or how was your journey but in fact i need your credit card the final words spoken to us were not have you enjoyed your stay or was everything ok but everything s paid i don t know where the marvellous staff were who ve been mentioned in other reviews but there was no sign of them during our stay if a room is so small that you cannot fit in a double bed that each person can get in from their own side it shouldn t be sold as a double room a very average stay with a great need for staff training in evidence
