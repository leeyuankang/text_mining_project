the room whilst very big and on a split level was extremely noisy from the people walking around upstairs and slamming doors to the other tenants guest arguing partying until the early hours little to no sound proofing which is a real shame the room was clean but the cushions bed cover not quilt were not very clean which gave the room an unkept feel
