the room we booked was not available when we arrived they tried to upgrade us to the scheherazade suite which is in the basement off a yard which had no windows it was like a dungeon and totally unsuitable we did not accept it and were given a smaller room which was comfortable but not what we had booked it was a shame as the hotel is nice and if you get the nice big room you book then i would have no hesitation recommending it
