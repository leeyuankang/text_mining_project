staff not very helpful room facilities listed were not all present no alarm clock no iphone dock no bathrobes no tea or coffee facilities and the wifi never worked we asked for knives and forks and the reception said he was busy with something at and we will have to wait we never received them there were incredibly loud people in the patio talking from to about am we were unable to sleep and when called the reception at some point to ask them to be quiet he was stern with his voice and did not do it as the noise and talking went on for another half hour or so breakfast was nice the rest of the staff were very nice only the evening receptionist whom seemed to hate his job
