i booked in advanced and specifically requested to not be placed in the basement unit given all of the other negative reviews of basement units unfortunately we were placed in the basement this is partially because when we checked in they didn t have our reservation this is because they relied on paper printouts for guest details the room we had essentially had no sunlight also the bathroom lights went out while the hotel did fix the lights they left the repair ladder and equipment in the bathroom and we had to remove it ourselves finally while wifi was supposed to be included it never worked and no this wasn t user error i work in it and understand wifi networks very well there are definitely better hotels in the area for the same price point or lower i would advise others to choose a different hotel due to the quality of the facilities and rooms if you do book avoid the basement at all costs
