on this occasion i didn t like the room i stayed in basement junior suite room as the chair table didn t work height wise so i couldn t sit work chair was way too low there was no mobile phone reception the tv was left of the bed so you neither watch to from the bed or armchairs comfortably it is a double bedroom not a suite please don t be put off though as generally the other rooms are great staff are welcoming
