i travel to london regularly on business and am pretty relaxed about where i stay this was without doubt the worst hotel i ve ever stayed in i seriously considered moving but couldn t find an alternative on the day the room i was allocated was in a next door building not the actual hotel there wasn t actually standing height around the bed or in the bathroom because of the mezzanine and low ceiling above the mezzanine room the neighbours a private flat i m guessing were very noisy until
