the dining room staff at breakfast were a little stern we booked a small double room we got room and it was just that extremely small the double bed had approximately inches of free space around it and that was it no other space at all in the room the door to the bathroom hit the bed you have to be stood to the right of the door to the hallway to be able to get out for me and my husband to be able to get out successfully he d have to exit first then i d have close the door behind him step past the end of the bed reopen the door either that or clamber over the bed the bathroom obviously doesn t have a bath the free floor space was about square but we aren t bath loving people so that was irrelevant to us the bathroom lights were automatic timed and went out in the middle of both of our showers meaning we had to yell to the other person to open the bathroom door to re activate them
