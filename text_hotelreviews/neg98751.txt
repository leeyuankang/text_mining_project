i would stay there again but i suspect that they are thinly staffed and have a basic internal system making it difficult for the night shift to notify the morning shift eg we couldn t get them to deliver coffee to our room the next morning ultimately the difference between a good and a great hotel are the little things there are few perks to be had here there is a basic shower and no temperature control we never did get a response to our question on turning down the heat
