i felt like the breakfast staff could have been friendlier or at least allowed my own access to tea or coffee if they aren t going to automatically ask but it s not a big issue really i enjoyed this hotel overall floors are a bit creaky so we could hear the antics of the room above but the hotel staff can t do much about that
