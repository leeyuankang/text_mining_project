the hotel was advertised as non smoking one of the main reasons we booked but they had a designated area for smoking which was immeadiatly outside french doors to our room the hotel had placed a table chair about a foot away from our doors to encourage smokers to relax chat not only did this disturb us during inconvenient hours we felt it an intrution to our privacy the room was filled with the smell of tobacco and my child age stayed in the room with me who is asthmatic i was totally amazed that a smoking area was in this area which i feel would be illegal especially if health safty were to visit
