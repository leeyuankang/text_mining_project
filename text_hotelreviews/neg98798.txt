i would have evaluated the comfort as superb but there was a problem in the bathroom to save energy there is no light switch a sensor regulates the light and fan the bathroom door can never be left open because anyone walking by activates the sensor and if a guest is inside using the bathroom the light can go off in the middle of say showering and has to be activated in the dark by some kind of adequate movement
