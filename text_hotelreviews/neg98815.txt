not easy to find my original room booked got changed a lot of noise from upstairs room floorboards and very thin partition as i could hear other guests the shower door was jammed i also found unnecessary items in the room like spare light bulbs and tools like screw driver and other bits the breakfast area was cramped and i didn t really enjoy my breakfast either
