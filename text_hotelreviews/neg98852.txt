first we were given a deluxe double room which was a tiny hobbit size room where it was almost impossible to move around it was also rather run down luckily we got another bigger and better room same deluxe category for the rest of the stay that was ok the quality of rooms seem to vary a lot the words luxury in hotel description should be removed for example the luxury toiletries were ordinary shampoo and soap bathropes very sad jokes not a good value for money
