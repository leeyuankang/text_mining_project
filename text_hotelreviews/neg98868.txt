the room is so very very small so there is hardly any room for the luggage the bed is actually a single bed plus half luckily i am very small so i could squeeze in the bed with my husband the room was super hot there is no air conditioning but a fan we slept with the windows and doors open we felt a bit frightened doing this the balcony can be accessed by other properties next to it when we complained at reception about the heat and how we had to sleep with the window and door open we were told it is safe to sleep with the windows and doors open we paid for a room to have a good night s sleep in a hotel but we had to camp for the nights at the hotel i hope the hotel understands that sleeping with the window and door open is not safe
