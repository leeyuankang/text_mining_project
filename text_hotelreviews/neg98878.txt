the rooms need to be cooler in the summer we had room right off the front desk the room was hot but we could not sleep with the windows open because we were awoken all night be people literally right outside our window we asked for a fan and we were told they did not have a working fan also the room above us needs to have the floor boards tightened if we weren t getting awoken by the outside chatter it was from the noise coming from people just walking across the creaky floor above my advice to help get this hotel up to par invest in ceiling fans for all your rooms helps provide cool air for sleeping and white noise to cancel out other noises for the money we paid for nights we were disappointed in the quality of sleep we got mostly lack of sleep it s one thing for a hotel to look nice it s another to make sure the rooms are comfortable and quiet for your guests you may get them in the door with your nice website pictures but you will disappoint them after one bad night s sleep
