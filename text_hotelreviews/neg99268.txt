if your e looking to have an easy time with wifi thermostat i e modern amenities etc this is not the place for you i was put in a lovely pretty room but it was in the basement never even thought to ask not to be put in a basement bc didn t know hotels had rooms here which was on the cold side and i then discovered there was no way to adjust the thermostat other than to put on a space heater i e no a c in this hotel and rooms can vary be stuffy or too cold staff was helpful and attempted to move my room but the next room was worse too hot also wifi in the basement was not reliable and this was frustrating as was the dark view outside i was initially moved to another room upstairs at my request which was stuffy temperature wise and the lack of a c was a problem also the locks on the doors are not easy to maneuver old locks and keys which are cute but i got stuck in one of the first rooms i was given bc the door was old and broken
