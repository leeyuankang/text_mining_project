the hotel looks beautiful from outside but my room was rather disappointing my room was downstairs ground floor which was one floor down from the reception and apparently the only room without a bath tub the room was small wifi signals both from the hotel and from my wifi router were too weak in the room and i needed to go to the lobby to use wifi
