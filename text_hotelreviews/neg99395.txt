we thought that the breakfast selection could be improved the eggs and sausages tasted like they ve been reheated a few times and there was very little fresh produce on offer a handful of fruits and a bowl of wrinkly cherry tomatoes they charge euros per person for breakfast and for this amount it is probably better to head to a caf to kickstart the day also we were almost charged separately for the breakfast which was in fact already included in our room reservation
