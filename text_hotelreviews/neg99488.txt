rooms are small but fine for a few days visit as we were out and about most of the time odd system when we booked as they sent a form to fill in for credit card details without which they couldn t guarantee the room not sure if this was a one off due to an issue or if it was standard for the hotel or booking com seemed a bit odd but confirmed directly with the hotel that it was all above board just caused a bit of panic a day or two before we travelled
