staff wasn t super helpful and we couldn t enter the parking lot with our driver or when we were just walking back to the property bathroom was a separate tiny square in the room and hot with no ventilation we upgraded and i felt like it wasn t worth the extra money we spent i tried calling the house keeping to ask for missing items in our room and they never came we had breakfast one of the mornings and decided we could find better and less expensive by walking around the city to a bakery
