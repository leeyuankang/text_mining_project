not enough milk to make coffee for the no of us sharing the room and on top of it thin plastic cups tiny rooms hardly any space to move curtains looked untidy ugly room view very noisy cleaners they talk and laugh at the top of their voices so no privacy and respect for tired guests sleeping in early morning because of touring and returning late at night the outlay of the room is very impracticle very tight around mirror bar fridge and entrance although the hotel is located very close to the eiffel tower which is a bigg attraction it is overpriced for what it offers due to it s location and i found the decor and outlay quite poor very expensive accomodation for what you get no breakfast incl in accomodation reception understaffed always busy so guests are kept waiting to be served laundry is s expensive especially over weekends and there is no retractable washing line in the bathroom airconditioning is feeble
