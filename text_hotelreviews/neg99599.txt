it s ok as a bed for the night if you re spending all your time sightseeing this hotel is not star standard in my opinion and very poor for an accor owned hotel it s in need of a major facelift don t expect anything but french tv no movie selections we also paid for a privilege room which was no different to most standard hotel rooms smaller in my opinion and didn t get a view of the eiffel tower i will be using air bnb for my next stay in paris
