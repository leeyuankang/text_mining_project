staff are not helpful we found a leakage under the water basin and called the front desk they said will handle and we have no answer after minutes we went down to the front desk and the staff said cannot change to another room because it was full and can only change for us on the next day we booked for consecutive nights the next day morning no one follow up we have to talk to the staff morning shift again which wasted us a lot of time they request us to come back before to pack our luggage and change the room we were advised that if after the housekeeper may not be able to clean our room no shower caps provided i asked front desk again they said will bring to the room and again seems my message was being ignored i stayed here in and was very satisfied but now i would say i will never stay in this hotel anymore
