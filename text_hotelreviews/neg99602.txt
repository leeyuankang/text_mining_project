pretty much everything the bed was the worst it was a queen size bed for me and my partner but we felt like the edges made us roll off so we both tried squashing in the middle of the bed the service desk never picked up our calls there was no toothbrush or paste the room stunk every time we walked in probably rather stay in a motel next time
