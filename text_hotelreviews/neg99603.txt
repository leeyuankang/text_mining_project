i love the mercure hotels have stayed in many now but security on the door needs to be all night at the smoking area which is at the entrance to the hotel a chinese man was at the smoking area when two people came up to him and stole his bag off his arm it was so upsetting to see this man so upset they need tighter security at the entrance we come to paris to enjoy the sights not to be stolen from i kept my bag over my body all the time so did the chinese man they distracted him and took his bag off his body i had a lovely four day break but unfortunately this is what i remember the most now
