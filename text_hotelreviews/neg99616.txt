front office is not helpful at all pretend to be busy all the time which actually they are not very rude and sarcastic when ring to them for an urgent help can just hang up the phone by telling busy been to many countries and stayed in many other chain hotels but this is the worst experience i have ever had will definitely discourage anyone from staying here
