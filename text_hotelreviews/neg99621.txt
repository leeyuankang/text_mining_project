small rooms but we are in paris after all and not really very cosy in the reception area s so didn t hang around much we were told their was no normal rooms left and only priviligre rooms but when we got there the difference in these rooms was a dressing gown and offer of a small free mini bar so not sure why we couldn t have had the normal room rate without the extra s put in for us
