far to expensive cost me per night and an additional euro per night for a view of the eiffel tower they did not mention that the view was just the top third of the tower as there is a huge hotel blocking the view the room was tiny and had only bedside table and no dressing table no bath only shower and a tiny toilet cubicle it was like an airplane toilet cubicle breakfast is rubbish too
