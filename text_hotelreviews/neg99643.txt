although the staff were not rude they weren t terribly friendly it was a bonjour and straight to the point and you were lucky if you got a smile this applied to every single member of staff i spoke to at the hotel a simple how are you or how was your journey isn t too much to ask on our third day there my sister was very unwell with a cold i rang up reception and asked for a bottle of water to which she replied you have had your one free bottle for the stay you will have to come down and pay for one i then pleaded that my sister was unwell and so the lady asked me to call housekeeping who did not pick up i m not sure how to describe how frustrating it was that a hotel would not give me one bottle of water when somebody was ill without me having to beg for it and even then i didn t receive it and had to walk down to the local shop i didn t bother complaining at reception because the staff were not approachable at all it s really a shame because it s a fantastic location and the staff really do just give me a negative connotation of mercure hotels now and i would hesistate before booking one again
