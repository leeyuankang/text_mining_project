the bathroom is too small in the rooms i didn t like that the toilet and shower was in a separate room which was small and you didn t have enough room to move around the pictures online don t show how small the bathroom is i also think it was overpriced for the room i stayed at much better hotels for less than what i paid at mercure and we arrived at night time and couldn t find the hotel because the display lights were off at the top of the hotel the hotel was located on the side of pullman hotel which was hard to find at night luckily people were friendly enough to help us find the hotel
