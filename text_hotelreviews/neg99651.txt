only found one waiter who was friendly and helpful out of the entire staff at the hotel hotel rooms were not replenished throughout the stay only had one bottle of water and six single serves of milk for the four days for two people although the hotel looks spectacular the service and value for money lets it down the only positive is that it was close to the eiffel tower
