toilet was separated from rest of bathroom in the tighest smallest closet like room there was a strong smell of old urine in the toilet stall and it did not go away this hotel is only feet away from the eiffel tower but the stay is not worth it the staff was not friendly either and lacked interest in wanting to help us tourists with any information we asked the bed was hard as a rock too so be prepared for the aches and pains
