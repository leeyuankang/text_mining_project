check in took very long time at late evening and we had asked for a room with bath tub but instead we received a handicap room with ony one large shower this room definitely needed an update bathroom vacuum cleaning started at outside the room luckily we are always awake at that time since we stayed here just a couple of month ago and then thought the hotel was really good this time was a dissapointment when we found the staff very ingnorant unlike last time the breakfast was ok but nothing special and the room outdated most hotels premiere returning guests but this is not the case in this hotel we will not return to this hotel again
