this was my second time at this hotel the first time i booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room i was given this time i opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room i had stayed in before it just might be that i was given a free upgrade the first time
