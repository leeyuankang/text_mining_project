i booked a double and a triple room and pre paid nine months ago when we arrived at the hotel they had no record of the triple room and we ended up being on the same floor but about fifteen rooms apart my husband and i had to split up and sleep with the kids as they were frighted by themselves obviously the rooms were poorly serviced not cleaned well and mini bar not restocked breakfast boxes ordered and paid for with an early flight were never delivered we were extremely disapointed with our stay at mercure hotel yes the location is wonderful everything else underwhelmingly bad
