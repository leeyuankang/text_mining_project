for the price we got a tiny room with a view of the top of the tower there is an early check in fee of euro if you arrive before pm they take euro per person per day from your credit card in anticipation of extra expenditure on breakfast or their restaurant even when you have paid for the room in advance we used none of their services in response and will report if they fail to refund the full amount i would not recommend this hotel it was poor value for money
