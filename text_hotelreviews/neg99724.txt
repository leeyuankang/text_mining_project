the hotel is old the rooms should be renovated eiffel tower views only for bigger rooms very small rooms the cleaning of the hotel very very poor we had a wine glass and paper rubbish on the floor outside our room for days no one cleaned it in our room we didn t get shower soap at all used coffee cups hasn t been taken away for days bin wasn t emptied neither the hotel is rather stars i guess the stars is given for the location which is magnificent
