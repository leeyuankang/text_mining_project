booked triple room but apart from third bed not enough pillows for three people only catered for two for coffee tea milk and cups in room had to keep requesting extra every day so disappointed in paper cups and wooden stick to stir for hot drinks felt i was in cheap takeaway rather than in a mecure hotel whatever happened to proper cups saucers and spoons in rooms concerned about wires left hanging on outside of lift button on floor certainly a health and safety concern otherwise close proximity to eiffel tower and very friendly staff
