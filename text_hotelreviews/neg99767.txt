lobby toilets were not very nice urine all over the seats and floor i had to run back up to my room disappointing considering you have to ask for a key to use them view from the room wasn t great i could see all the rubbish bins etc which i wouldn t mind but some was spread across the floor not something you want to look out at in the morning saying that next time i would probably book room with a view of the eiffel tower i might be a little picky here but we didn t feel very welcome in the bar not very chatty they dropped the bill half way through our drinks instead of asking us if we wanted another round which we did
