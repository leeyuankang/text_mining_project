the staff was unconcerned to the extent rude and not even wanting to listen and was argumentative type we had booked for persons in a room and they charged over and above the rate we had paid and didn t listen to our submissions that we have already booked for persons and paid at the time of booking and were not willing to listen and solve problem and no manager was willing to come and talk and they really overcharged us there were no greetings by any staff member to any resident at any time and they showed a non concerned approach except for the location there is nothing good in the hotel and next time we are not going to try any mercure hotel any where in the world
