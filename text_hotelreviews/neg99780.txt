check in was appalling my husband had pre paid for this trip as a gift but when i arrived with my mother and daughter they said they could not accommodate us as i did not have my husband credit card they needed the same one that had pre paid for hotel so i then had to pay for hotel again euros from my credit card and cancel my husband payment made in full four months earlier despite offering my card for pre authorisation during our stay plus we are still waiting for monies to be reimbursed to my husband account it upset the start of our trip and therefore decided not to use the hotel for breakfast or drinks during our stay because of this in protest as receptionist marjorie was rude unhelpful making me out to be someone who had stolen a card and bought a trip to paris
