the elevators were not good at all for having elevators only one was working the one that did work was shocking took us minutes to get from the floor down to the ground level with it going right up and stopping at every floor we also had requested early check in which i know was subject to availability so when we arrived we couldn t check in till but the hotel held our luggage for us to be able to then go out when we returned after to check in like we were told to our room was still not ready and the women that dealt with us was not helpful friendly at all we eventually had to be given another room after she had to check if there was one available for us
