i paid for a triple room but when we arrived i ve been told it s a double room at the end we got room with one double bed and sofa bed however room was extremely small so still not sure for what i really paid for because of that we have to wait longer for our room to be ready it was really small double bed deco could be much better however room was very clean it s all about great location because standard of the room was overpriced please put some proper cups not a paper ones
