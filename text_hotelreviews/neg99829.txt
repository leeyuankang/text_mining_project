for the price the room was tiny it had a separate wc i e not in the bathroom which was awkward there was a tiny amount of shower gel and no other toiletries the towels were tiny no bathrobes no flannels we were left one bottle of water for two people for two nights the d cor was that style only the french can do science fiction featuring lots of cheap plastic the rooms and corridors badly need a makeover i know we were paying for the location but i expect much more from a four star hotel check in and checkout proved to be another french speciality long winded bureaucracy and a big local tax bill
