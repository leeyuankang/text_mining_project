on arriving to check in we were asked to pay euros in case we had any chargeable items which i can certainly say in my years i have never paid before so this made me cross the receptionist was rude and unwelcoming the toilet water ran continually and in the room we had tea coffee making facilities with cardboard cups they are very difficult to wash up and not consistant of a star hotel awful the euro charge has not gone back on my credit card yet
