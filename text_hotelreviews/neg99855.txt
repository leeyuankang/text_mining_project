it was our first time visiting the eiffel tower and we were really disappointed in the area nothing like we had expected the tower itself is amazing of course but is set in an area of average looking parkland there are few eating opportunities and the area between the tower and the hotel is of unattractive modern buildings we looked out of our hotel window to see a group of people sleeping rough on the roof of a neighbouring building
