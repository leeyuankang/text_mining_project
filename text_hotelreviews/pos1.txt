no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to amsterdam
