just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court where to start from the amazing upgrade for my husbands birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start the hotel is in a great location less than minutes walk to covent garden and for location alone is great value i had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner it s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the london eye the apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans pringles and of course the apex duck we had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay they really have thought about everything we have stayed in many hotels in london but would definately choose apex again
