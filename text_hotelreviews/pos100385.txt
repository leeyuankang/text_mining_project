the staff and the way they dealt with not having a room with twin beds which i had requested on the booking form available when i arrived late on friday night with my daughter instead we were given two room at no extra cost for that night with a twin room for the following nights of our stay we even had six delicious chocolates and a bottle of water together with a note of apology left in our room on saturday evening the hotel is ideally situated for the opera garnier and is a minute walk to the louvre if you re travelling on the eurostar the no bus to the gare du nord stops virtually outside the hotel
