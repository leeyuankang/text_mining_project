booked a balcony suite for a hen weekend the suite was spacious the bed and sofa bed were very comfortable the bathroom was spacious especially for women getting dressed to go out the hotel and left a bottle of champagne in the room for us it was really lovely to have the space to relax we used it as our hub and travelled around very easy from there we had breakfast in the room and it was really good quality definitely worth booking a suite if you want some more space
