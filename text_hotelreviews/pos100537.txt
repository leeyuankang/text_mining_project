where do i start location perfect right on the river perfectly placed within walking distance of everything for those that are inclined to walk but also equally close to all need transport hubs including the hop on hop off bus routes facilities are awesome to beautiful bars one on bottom floor and one on the floor from memory both with beautiful views of london and the river the rooms are large for both london and europe in general and the bed was divine to sleep on but what makes a good hotel great its staff being in business for myself its all the little things that stood out and the list is long the best example was i had late night drinks in the level bar on two nights i have a particular drink i like and only ordered it once on the first visit nighst later on a busy night in the bar im standing two deep at the bar and the original bar tender calls out to me with both my choices in his hand asking is that what im after huge thumbs up from me this pattern of behaviour was everywhere you would not be dissapointed staying at this hotel
