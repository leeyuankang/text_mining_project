the size of the room was generous for london and the d cor made it feel special the bathroom was also enormous and the shower brilliant we visited both cocktail bars and even though we were over twice the average age in both were made to feel welcome and the cocktails although eye wateringly expensive were excellent and worth it the views in both bars were fantastic the location is great we were visiting the national theatre a walk away and tate britain short taxi ride tate modern is also only a walk away
