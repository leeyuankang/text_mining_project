from end to end my stay was great a very convenient location close to blackfriars to be able to get you to anywhere you need quickly the hotel itself is a feat of design and i love the overall feel quite often design hotels can be more style over substance but the mondrian london does not disappoint at all very careful attention to detail throughout with high quality rooms and services the rooftop bar is also stunning a worth visit
