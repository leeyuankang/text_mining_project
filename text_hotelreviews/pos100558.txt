the staff was very nice and friendly but no bonuses they will give no courtesies only exactly what you paid for so do not go thinking that you will get upgrades or breakfast for example the hotel is great and look wonderful the suite is fantastic but the hotel is far from almost everything the croissant is delicious but it is perfect if you do not mind going everywhere with a taxi or car where parking is available not that easy in london the concierge is great and helpful would not stay again only because of the distance from the attractions shopping and so
