this place was everything i d hoped having walked past it so many times great lively ambiance at weekends aimed at well off twenty somethings lots of cool extras in the room like crystal glasses huge fluffy towels etc perfect location sculptures in the public areas are intriguing my standard room had a view of the oxo and the modernist architecture but i d be tempted to upgrade to a thames view next time
