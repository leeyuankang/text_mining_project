i stay at morgans hotels all the time it s pricey but worth every single cent i feel safe comfortable and it s also hip and trendy at the same time have no fear of the staff stealing i leave money in my room lying around and no one touches a thing love the mondrian and if u can manage get a deluxe river view on a high floor if possible great hotel
