the hotel occupies a beautiful location on the riverside with easy access to central london and beyond westminster tube isn t far away but i think the hotel is better suited to urban explorers and taxi riders we enjoyed the cocktail bar but it was a pity that the bar upstairs was closed for renovations the open spaces and decor give the hotel a wonderful ambience and the views can be wonderful from the front and sides of the hotel the room was clean and well presented and everything how one would expect in such a hotel the bathrooms were nice and the rainforest shower a pleasure the mini bar is fabulously well stocked with everything you might need from crystal head vodka and cocktails to adult toys and hangover kits
