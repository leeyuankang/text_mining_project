the location is amazing next to the river to the tate as any morgan hotel elsewhere details are everywhere and design is outstanding and the place is amazing day and night all restaurants and bar are great and staff is awsome many thanks to lovely zaira that got me a complementary upgrade for me and my colleagues and free drinks as it was my birthday a morgans experience with an amazing view of london
