we were staying for my partners birthday and the staff made sure that it was memorable and special in every way the hotel itself is perfectly placed on the south bank to explore london or just take in the cultural side of london with the tate modern just a short walk away and the shard also a min walk i cannot fault this hotel in any way and would highly recommend it
