unfortunately service isn t good at the mondrian when i arrived the driver was about to drop me in front of the hotel when some guy supposedly from the hotel told him he volent stop there so he dropped me further away under the rain no one was there either to help me with my luggage there is no la carte breakfast but only a buffet that isn t very good no bathrobe slippers nor cotton buds or cotton pads in the bathroom a vulgar sticky plastic shower curtain in the bathroom no turndown service either of course these are certainly not up to the stars standards the hotel is supposed to be though the view on the thames from the restaurant is nice and it s close to the tate modern
