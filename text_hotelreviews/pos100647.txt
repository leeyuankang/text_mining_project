so much is great with this hotel where to start staff are hugely accommodating helpful and friendly this is from interaction with reception restaurant both dinner and breakfast and the spa it s clean stylish roomy in a great location and very comfortable i upgraded to a thames view room which i didn t regret and even left the curtains open so that when i nipped to the loo during the night and woke up in the morning i could see what was going on on the river you can dim all the lights and just have a lulling glow from outside come in if that doesn t put you off sleeping i also stayed in december when it s still quite dark on a morning and it wasn t invasive i couldn t hear anything either excellent soundproofing the spa is fantastic i m a big fan of spa hotels my favourite to date being the corinthia in budapest but this one comes in a very close second really appealing to all my senses it s wonderfully spacious beautifully decorated has very helpful staff and lovely treatments food at the restaurant is innovative and delicious i m choosing more and more veggie options these days and decided on small starters as a kind of tapas style meal fried brussel sprouts raw sliced mushrooms with truffle oil grated cheese and pine nuts yum and mac and cheese with truffle which was absolutely delicious the location is great on the river just next to blackfriars bridge so really central for getting around
