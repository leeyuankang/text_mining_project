the location was great if you want the south bank easy walk to tate modern and borough market to the east southwark tube is fast and well connected and you can even walk to waterloo station if you re travelling light the rumpus cocktail bar on the was fun one assumes the bill one runs up is par for the course in london drinks come in around a pop and a plate of finger bites were which i thought a tad over priced there was a good spread for breakfast and a decent a la carte featuring eggs benedict et al though the price comes in pretty close so it s probably worth including breakfast if you have a big appetite sitting next to the windows on a wintry day with st pauls across the water was a great way to start the day for sure the staff are all very good looking and debonair polite and on the ball and it has a bit of buzz to the place that reminds me of the days it all kicked off in l a in the nineties i m not sure anything in london has that buzz anymore and the rumpus is not the star bar but they re having a go at making it feel like something is going on
