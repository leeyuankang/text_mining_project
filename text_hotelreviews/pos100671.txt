loved everything except the dandelyan bar on the dec my birthday the service was shocking the poor new doorman tried his hardest to accommodate us but the bearded guy was so rude and dismissive nonetheless we understood the bar was full so we walked away and got incredible service at oxo returned to dandelyan much later lovely new doorman was so happy to see us back we got seated sat for over half an hour didn t get served even though it was no longer busy so we left happy birthday me all the staff except new doorman in dandelyan were rubbish staff on the dec in the rumpus room were amazing reception housekeeping etc all great the dandelyan lets you down massively
