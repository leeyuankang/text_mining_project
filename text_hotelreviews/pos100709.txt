the concierge were lovely helpful and very apologetic when our room wasn t ready we were given a better room than expected and a complimentary drink to boot the room was perfect many hotels have beautiful rooms that just aren t that functional this was was so homely and we personally were taking note for our own home redesign the view is amazing over the river products in the bathroom were grade a overall great experience and loved the location
