wonderful location next to the river great area with fun places like the south bank and borough market just five or ten minutes walk away the public spaces are stunning and bizarre i particularly like the yellow submarine in the restaurant dandelyon the cocktail bar next door is just remarkable sit at the bar and chat to the bartenders masters of their art
