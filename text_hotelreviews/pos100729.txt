amazing location the rooms are elegant yet very relaxing the whole place has a very good vibe the staff is friendly and genuinely interested in making sure your stay is as good as possible the room was amazing really comfortable and had everything and more i needed having a terrace looking out on the river made it special and it s a really nice touch and a really rare thing in london although it s very central and the river gets really busy and the room looked out to blackfriars bridge the soundproofing was good enough so the room wasn t noisy at all the complimentary newspaper was a nice touch
