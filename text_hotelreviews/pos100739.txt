excellent location very close to the london eye especially beautiful hotel room was clean and comfortable but for the amount of time we spent in it as tourists we don t use the room a lot we could have got a travel lodge type hotel for about cheaper absolutely no view we didn t ask to be moved there are rooms with a view so be sure to ask for one also no bath robes despite this the visit was great and the bed was super comfortable
