very trendy hotel in the busy southbank area very convenient if you just want to chill out at a hip restaurant and people watch staff are all very pleasant and accommodating breakfast is delicious a great selection to choose from but a little pricey for what it is but the whole of london is expensive so it shouldn t be a shock
