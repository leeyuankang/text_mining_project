we stayed here sadly for only one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary amazing location right on the river thames with outstanding views our room was quiet very comfortable bed and an amazing bathroom with huge shower what really made this stay special was the staff without fault every member of staff was courteous and interested in you the playlist in the bar was enough to encourage you to stay longer just in case the cocktails did nt encourage you lovely touch of free round of drinks for our anniversary will certainly stay again
