simply amazing all in all very satisfied i loved everything offered by this hotel room size is good was provided with two baby cots no nice view but i m fine with that since we are all day out we loved the handy mobile provided in the room where we used it when we go out as gps and entertain my toddlers with youtube nursery songs as it includes connection you feel like home in this hotel i will sure come back again to this hotel and will recommend to others location cannot be better close to london eye and big ben southwark festival just minutes walk restaurants cafes nice street life atmosphere is just minute walk cleanliness i m very picky when it comes to cleanliness and i cannot rate it to be out of staff friendly helpful whenever you request anything you will get in less than minutes
