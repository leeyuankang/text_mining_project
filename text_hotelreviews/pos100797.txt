i treated my mum to a weekend in london after a serious operation i let the staff know before my visit and they treated us so well from the beginning of making this booking right throughout our stay the staff at the mondrian could not have been nicer the room was beautiful i am sure we were upgraded because of the circumstances of our visit we had the best view of the thames and southbank we were even treated to a complementary bottle of cava the restaurant is amazing and the staff there brilliant the same with the spa which is paradise i d like to thank all the staff that helped make our stay from beginning to end an amazing experience
