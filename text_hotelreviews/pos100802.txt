mondrian at sea containers is a beautiful modern hotel with all the facilities that make a great home away from home and stunning design features abound just check out the reception s ship s hull for an incredible first impression but what really makes it stand out are the staff the service here is quite simply amazing we encountered a smile on every face a great atmosphere in all the public rooms plus free cocktails in the dandelyon bar on our return from the theatre just wonderful a really first rate experience one which i wish other hotels could live up to with great views of london the thames there s a fabulous rooftop bar and in a fab location with trendy southbank restaurants shopping and shakespeare s globe nearby the mondrian is pretty much the perfect place to stay in london i ll definitely be staying here again
