i arrived very late after midnight and was stressed out after delayed flights and delayed trains was welcomed by a lovely friendly lady at reception and was immediately de stressed when she informed me that her manager had upgraded me to a riverside balcony suite she also agreed to kindly give me a late check out which really made my stay as i could chill the next morning after arriving so late these little things like late check out where possible and upgrades where possible make all the difference and make a guest feel like they are being spoiled also the leisure facilities were top class didnt have a chance to check out the bar and restaurant this time but i m already looking forward to next time i stay thanks guys
