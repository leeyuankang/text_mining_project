overall this was a very enjoyable stay i stayed here as i met friends in the evening and the location was ideal for that as well as getting to the office the next day i liked the room layout the bathroom was spacious with everything you could need the quality of the toiletries is impressive the bed was very comfortable there is a mini bar which had the best variety i have seen it was refreshing that the items were free standing and not locked down like other hotels the crystal glasses were a nice touch the hotel had thought of everything even a spare phone charger the room was quiet the staff were friendly and it was a very enjoyable stay
