absolutely everything they do in the mondrain makes you feel like a celebrity and the customer service levels are on a different level not only are the rooms well designed the attention to detail is also spot on the emergency kits and mini bar are particularly impressive cannot fault this hotel and they are definitely giving the shard a run for there money as location is stunning in the evening especially if you have drinks in the award winning cocktail bar overall it definitely sits in my top hotels i have ever stayed in and i ve stayed in a few for sure highly recommended and will definitely return for those special occasions in london
