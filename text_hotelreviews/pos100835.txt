extremely disappointed with perceived value from advertising it s overrated and over charged on what is a limited river view inconsistent staff service at front desk reception and poor service dress code of staff really made a huge difference certainly not the image this high price hotel should project a bit unprofessional to say the lest and certainly will not be back in to this hotel again
