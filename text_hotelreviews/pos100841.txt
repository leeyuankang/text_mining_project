the views are amazing from both the ground floor restaurant which is directly on the waters edge and from the rooftop bar our lunch was delicious and the staff very attentive in the evening we had drinks in th rumpus room which is very luxurious i would recommend booking a table though as it was very busy our bedroom was spotless and very comfortable
