facilities in a standard room very good design well thought out eg shower control not behind shower head and some nice touches in the room eg selection of cut glasse to suit all choices from the mini bar which was extensive and expensive and therefore avoided bed very comfortable good pillows and feather duvet made for a good nights sleep
