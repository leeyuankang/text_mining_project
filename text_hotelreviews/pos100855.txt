i arrived in london earlier than expected and my room wasn t due to be ready until however upon getting to the hotel mid morning to check my bag in i was advised that my room was indeed ready this was a fantastic start to my stay and the level of service was better than expected i met friends also in london for the weekend who were staying at other hotels and took them to the dandelyan bar in the evening well to say they were impressed would be an understatement the views over the thames were a delight i will definitely be coming back and will highly recommend to other people the malin goetz products in the bathrooms the fortune cookie in the bedrooms details details details love it
