after a few language barriers at breakfast time lucky the staff finally understood i liked my poached eggs extra done we were on a time scale which did get disturbed i did try and cancel the order all together however was almost pushed into staying extremely clean and tidy which is the most important to me the bar staff were lovely and we did overall enjoy our stay and would still come and stay again
