we stayed here for one night for my boyfriend s birthday the location is great and the views from the deluxe rooms are amazing the rooms are spacious and modern it s got a really great feel i emailed in advance to say it was his birthday and upon arrival they wished him a happy birthday and gave us a voucher for free cocktails to use in their bar which was a really nice touch
