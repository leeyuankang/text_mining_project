i booked one night in a standard room for my partners birthday i was beyond satisfied with the room which featured the comfiest hotel bed i ve ever slept in and pillows with a bit of stiffness like i enjoy the view wasn t spectacular but i knew i would only get a river view with a deluxe room the room and the whole hotel was mondernly furnished which is so hard to come by for this rate with a lovely walkin shower and deliciously smelling toiletries cocktails and vibes in both the rumpus room and dandelyan while contrasting like day and night were great both get very busy so definitely worth booking a table it s worth keep in mind the hotel is in a residential area so sadly the outdoor rooftop patio closes at which we didn t realise they hotel staff were very hospitable providing me with feminine products in an emergency delivery delicious and prompt room service being super cheery when we arrived and when we left before we arrived i was put i touch with an experience manager who made our celebration that much more special by surprising us with a hand written birthday card a birthday dessert during our stay in the spa and a round of drinks on the hotel we ll definitely be recommending to my international family and friends when they come to visit
