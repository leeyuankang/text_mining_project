location wise the mondrian is perfect easily walkable from southwark tube station and located right on the southbank next to blackfriars bridge we had a great view of the thames and st pauls the bar on the ground floor was voted the observer s top london bar in and you can see why the decor is amazing the staff incredibly knowledgable and the cocktails are a real experience try the century boy if you re a gin drinker we didn t check out the cinema or the roof top bar this time but will probably do so on our next visit our room was large and spotlessly clean the in room services were all as you d expect from a good hotel particularly liked having pre made cocktails from the afore mentioned bar available and a proper internet connection which worked reliably and at a good speed
