this hotel is in an ideal location for visiting the south bank being right by the river meant excellent views to various london landmarks being a fairly new hotel meant that everything felt fresh both in the public areas and our room we just had the standard double but it was a good size with plenty of places to put everything we had a very good night s sleep and enjoyed the crisp bed linen all the staff were very friendly and helpful
