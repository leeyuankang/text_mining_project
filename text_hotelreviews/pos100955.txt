can not fault the hotel one bit as soon as we arrived they took our suitcases off me and my girlfriend i planned this night stay as a surprise for my girlfriends as we arrived at our room there was a bottle of prosecco chilling in an ice bucket with a little note next to it wishing us a happy stay and birthday very clean spacious and modern room had everything you would need and more they even have their own cocktail bar on the floor would definitely return
