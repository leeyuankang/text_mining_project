me and my partner had a great stay at the mondrian the standard room was still a decent size and it was super clean generous sized amenities beautiful walk in shower and good lighting throughout the room staff were young bubbly and friendly and check in and check out were super quick and smooth decor in entrance lift bathroom and room were beautiful unique and artsy good buzz it just had a good feel to it as a whole walking in through the bar area etc we had very few if any complaints at all except not noticing being told we have to swipe our cards to operate the lift we were in and out multiple times before i noticed the sign and got us going it made for a good joke and all in all not a major issue for us we will both be back and intend on now staying there regularly maybe in a superior room
