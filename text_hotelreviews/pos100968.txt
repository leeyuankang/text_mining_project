location was a perfect distance between where we wanted to visit theatre borough market underground the staff were very attentive gave us brilliant recommendations and phoned ahead to check borough market was open for us also took our bags in the sunday so we could still look round london without pulling suitcases the bed was the most so comfy room temperature was perfect and the little touches throughout the room were lovely
