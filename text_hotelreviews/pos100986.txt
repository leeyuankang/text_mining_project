this hotel is very nice and normally above our price range but perhaps due to low season we stayed there for app pounds night for which it was excellent value in this location the room was very nice and the rumpus room bar on the floor also excellent including the unparalleled view also after i accidentally forgot my wedding ring in the room after departure the staff was very helpful over the phone and posted it to me
