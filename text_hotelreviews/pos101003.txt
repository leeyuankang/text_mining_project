we knew we were in for a good experience as we walked into the modern hotel reception greeted by friendly staff who soon had us settled in our room and were quick to help with any requests we had throughout our stay simple but stylish modern room was well recieved by my other half comfortable easy chairs bed etc we ate at the oxo tower which is a two minute if that walk so made for very relaxing night nice chilled atmosphere during the evening and cool surroundings in downstairs bar breakout area sitting watching people strolling along southbank late in the evening was nice touch all topped with fantastic central location for our christmas break will be staying again i hope
