i had booked this for my parents as my dad was celebrating a significant birthday the staff were outstanding we all received a lovely warm welcome with some gentle banter we were told at reception that they d been upgraded and as we arrived at the room a lovely member of staff was leaving having delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne and birthday cake what a lovely surprise the room was fabulous with a river view and was lovely and warm they couldn t have done more for my parents and i thoroughly recommend the hotel
