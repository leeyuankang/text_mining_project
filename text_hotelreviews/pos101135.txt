me and my partner loved the fact that we were with in walking distance of most things he is a black cab driver so he knows all the little slip roads also it was lovely that the hotel is based on the southbank it was an amazing atmosphere night and day and the cocktail bar was based downstairs over looking the river and also over looking st pauls it was also perfect for us as we had booked a reservation to eat at the oxo tower which was literally a minute walk we had a fantastic stay in such a modern hotel
