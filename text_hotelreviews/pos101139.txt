fabulous location ideal for both the lively royal a festival side of the southbank and the wonderful borough market staff were superb going out of their way to upgrade us for a special birthday and supplying free drinks at the bar as we waited whilst not cheap the dandelyan bar is a fantastic place to be in the day and the rumpas a room is a fabulous trendy night spot i d advise booking a table if you want to drink there into the night great hotel great location and pleasantly funky
