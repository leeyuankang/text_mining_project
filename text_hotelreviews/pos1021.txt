the hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of london so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit we didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep there was very little traffic noise either it was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards the novello is a about minutes walk away i loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home the room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean a bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries
