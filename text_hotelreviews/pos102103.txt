staff super helpful and friendly location great right in the heart of things immaculately clean individual and quirky hotel which i loved rather than bland and banal we even got a free upgrade from the lovely helpful and humourous guy on reception to the fishbowl room which had a great little balcony which was just fab thank you and made our stay extra special for my husband s birthday it just showed that little bit of extra effort which was really appreciated by us both
