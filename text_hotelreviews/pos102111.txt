the hotel has a fantastic off the wall look and feel to it the food served is far superior to any other restaurants we tried including some of the ones owned by famous chefs the reception staff were very nice and they made us feel very welcome the hotel is located just behind regent street and so is in a fantastic location for shopping as my wallet found out
