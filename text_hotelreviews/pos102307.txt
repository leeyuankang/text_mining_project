the hotel is in a really good location you can walk through the street to arrive at the natural history museum very pretty and nice neighbourhood you will definitely feel like a part of fine english society the lobby is quite cosy rooms are very good for the price the picture attached was the reason i woke up excited every morning to have a cup of tea and plan my day earls court station is quite nearby as well as many restaurants some of which will be fast food and some will be italian like zizzi nice places to have wine and pizza well done nh
