incredibly comfortable beds very large rooms my husband and i were on the top floor with our own bathroom and large walk in closet and the boys had their own downstairs kids were and and had a blast they were super impressed with the room on the write up air conditioning was not mentioned and therefore i just figured the hotel was not equipped with it an incredibly nice surprise when she walked into the room and a big waft of cold air hit us the air conditioning was perfect the accommodations couldn t have been better we are at the restaurant for one dinner and we re quite disappointed with the quality for the cost poor value the pool is dark and tranquil heavy chlorine seems only kids use it but because it is within the spa section the employees kept asking for everyone to be quite veryhallenging with kids under in an echoing environment we all had fun the location was super min walk to the louvre and right across the street from the park definitely great with kids subway across the street
