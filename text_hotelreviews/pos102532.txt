staying at the saint james albany hotel is like coming home for me i ve stayed there several times in the past the staff is welcoming and friendly the rooms are comfortable and complete and the restaurant is very good for both breakfast and dinner it is an historical landmark a charming older smaller hotel located within walking distance of most everything one would want to see in a visit to paris there is also a metro station directly across the street for those who don t want to explore paris on foot as well as a very helpful staff who will assist in planning that exploration it is a perfect home away from home for the solo or frequent traveler
