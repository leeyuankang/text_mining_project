beautiful room immaculate and clean lovely bathroom looked newly refurbished pretty courtyard which would be fantastic in summer breakfast was good value for money plenty of options breakfast in local cafes about same price and not so much choice so would definitely recommend eating at hotel excellent location and beautiful area very relaxing and peaceful ambiance throughout hotel would definitely stay here again
