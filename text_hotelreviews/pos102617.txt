location was great easy access to the attractions unfortunately the room was up floors and not accessible via stairs and one member of the party does not use a lift the spa was not a spa it was a very cold swimming pool with a steam room there was no jacuzzi like in the picture the breakfast had a good selection of pastries and bread along with cereals fruits and cooked breakfast drinks were very overpriced with an oj being the room was spacious very late comfy bed found a hair ball on the floor but otherwise clean staff seemed friendly and helpful lots of work going on in and around the hotel on our last day which if i had just arrived it would ve been a little disruptive understandably it has to be addressed
