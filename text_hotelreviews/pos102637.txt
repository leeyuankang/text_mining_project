the duplex junior suite they gave us no was located on ground floor next to the patio ensuring very quiet nights and that in the center of the city moreover for the moderate smoker that i am it was very convenient to just open the back door and light a shag on the patio the suite itself was spacious and warmly decorated redolent with the history of an old palace on the other hand the bathroom and the restroom are a bit too reminiscent of old days and could use a little refurbishing nice indoor swimming pool and hammam they should provide a few more hot showers in the spa with more of those occitane en provence products as in the guest rooms great continental breakfast with fresh grapefruit juice every morning
