i could not have chosen a better location absolutley everything was class from the location to the staff to the spa to the food i most certainly will be back and would urge anyone pondering over wether this is the right hotel for them to just do it you will not be disappointed a special mention goes to the staff they were so polite and helpful with all our questions and queries and i could tell they took genuine pride in and enjoyed their roles in this gem of a hotel nestled right in the beautiful heart of paris
