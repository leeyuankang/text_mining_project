i love that the albany st james the hotel is nestled like a perfect secret amongst the busiest and most central locations in paris almost facing the louvre and the most wonderfully decadent high end boutiques the beauty of the albany st james for me is that after an exhausting day of shopping or visiting galleries you simply step foot into the hotel and immediately your in a luxury haven of tranquillity the principal reason i booked the hotel was it s historical connections marie antoinette who visited the oldest part of the hotel when it was a private home the hotel staff are charming and extremely helpful particularly a very friendly bar tender lighthouse who gave us some useful local information
