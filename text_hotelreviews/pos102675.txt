what was good and what was not pool steps very thin and treacherous meaning we only used it once filet steak excellent steak tartar in room service was a mushy burger shaped offering rather than a tasty item concierge and staff very friendly apart from pool beautician who was a less so insufficient shower gels left daily but bed very very comfortable shower without a mixer tap hard to get temperature correct breakfast buffet very good
