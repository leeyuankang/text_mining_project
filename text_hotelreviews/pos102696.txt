absolutely loved the location close enough to the louvre to walk and rented bikes and rode to the eiffel tower it was a perfect location lots of cafes within walking distance the room was very comfortable with a large bathroom vanity and walk in shower nice amenities had a pretty view of the courtyard from our window the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly
