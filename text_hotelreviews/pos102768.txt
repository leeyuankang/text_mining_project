great area been to paris a few times now and rue de rivoli is the best for getting around do have to deal with a few more tourist traps and street hawkers but ignore them and you will be fine directly opposite the tullieries metro station and has a little courtyard and an great pool and hammam great breakfast at a reasonable cost plus everyone was super helpful even had the power needing to be turned off overnight due to a fire systems check and they provided little snap lights atc just in case didnt bother us as at least i knew they valued saftey over the comfort of guests for a night
