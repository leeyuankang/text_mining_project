the hotel itself was beautiful the staff especially ga l clement yuv and francesco were amazing the hotel even organised macaroons for my mums birthday as a surprise and we also think they organised the staff at the eiffel tower to sing happy birthday when we were having dinner there as they made the reservation for us wifi was good breakfast was lovely too they even have gluten free bread beds were so comfy and they even had a pool and a day spa there prime location loved it
