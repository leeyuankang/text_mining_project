we loved the location we were close to a lot of things we loved the restaurant the two nights we decided to eat there it is pricey but for quality convenience and service we would recommend it the bar area was comfortable and we spent a few hours there on two separate occasions and the spa was very nice with a wide variety of services we experienced a facial and massage the pool area and the sauna all very nice and clean i would recommend for them to switch their system in the pool from chlorine to a salt water system though much better on the skin and hair for a spa pool the service was very nice too i read about stuffy and uppity service but from my experience they were all knowledgeable and professional we didn t have any issues with the staff we appreciated their professionalism
