easy to get from the airport to the hotel fixed rate approximatly traffic dependant the hotel was very pretty and ideal for our needs we had never stayed with mercure before and had no idea what to expect we were however delighted with what we got and the value for money was excellent walking distance from the hotel to the eiffel tower was not far picturesque easy and very pleasent with lots of little bars and restuarants to stop in the walk was around slow walk and the approximate cost of a taxi was however we went when it was degress and wanted to enjoy the weather only getting taxis in the evening we did not eat here but did use the bar prices reasonable service good overall we were very happy with this hotel the room facilities staff and location
