the staff were very friendly and responded very positively to our attempts to speak french the selection of foods on the breakfast buffet was generally excellent and kept being replenished by the staff throughout breakfast time the croissants were lovely the location is good and there were several metro stations and bus stops within easy walking distance so no need for a car there was also a great selection of restaurants locally we were a bit spoilt for choice
