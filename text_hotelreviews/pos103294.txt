the property is from the dugommier metro which is great when you re carrying bags there s a lovely bakery around the corner and a monoprix supermarket across the road so that s very convenient the area right outside the hotel is not the cleanest but it s nothing to complain about we would definitely stay here again the staff were super friendly and accommodating
