my fiance and i could not be happier about our hotel choice location is fantastic it is a bit away from all the happenings but it is right by a metro station it seriously is only few steps away and paris metro system is easy to use and gets you anywhere in no time check in was great i am very sad i cannot remember the receptionist s name as she deserves a bonus for the service she provides she was tall slim young and black and truly terrific she helped us with all of our questions served us drinks after our long day of walking suggested a great restaurant for dinner and smiled whenever we passed by room was fantastic it was small as any other hotel room in paris but we did not mind at all the decoration and design made up for the space beautiful tv comfortable bed fantastic shower lots of storage it was simply great also my now fiance proposed to me on our first night there so i am sure we shall be back one day thank you guys for such a fantastic stay
