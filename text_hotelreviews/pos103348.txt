the room was super clean the bed was super comfortable the style super modern and the staff super friendly helpful they were able to help me print my tickets last minute which made my louvre visit really great being able to skip the line because i already had printed tickets it is also located just outside of a metro stop which made it so easy to find all together really enjoyable and worthwhile stay here
