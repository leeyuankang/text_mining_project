having stayed in a number of parisian hotels i knew what to expect more or less however hotel montfleuri s rooms are dazzlingly clean nearly all hotels fall short with their cleaning for me so this really stood out i appreciated the little nougat on the pillow and the room was cleverly laid out to make the most of the space the ability to tailor the lighting in the room was excellent too we arrived very early and were unable to get into our room totally understandable so when we did return to the hotel that evening staff had placed our cases in our room and we could go straight up it isn t a big thing but it s one less bit of bother after a long day that was much appreciated
