amazing reception and nice staff as they were so helpful and so nice to guest always smiling and welling to help i felt at home staying at this hotel as the staff were so kind the location is perfect quit and cozy the metro was right in front of the hotel there was a supermarket near by i liked that they offer triple room as we were three and the room size was a bit small but better that other persian hotels arc de triomphe was near the hotel which is perfect totally recommend staying at this hotel i asked for an airport shuttle and the hotel contacted a taxi and managed the delivery
