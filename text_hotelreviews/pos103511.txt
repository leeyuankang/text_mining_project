very friendly staff right from the outset very accommodating of our needs even on our final day we had a few extra hours left after checkout they kept our bags for safekeeping whilst we enjoyed the sights of the city the closest metro station is argentine use the underpass instead of crossing the road very central location but without the busyness of the champ de elysees very quiet and comfortable breakfast was reasonably good would definitely recommend
