the location is seconds away from a metro station argentine which is perfect and takes you to most of the important touristic spots in minutes while still being in a relatively quiet part of the city also you wake up with a view of arc de triomphe close by you ll find some nice high end shopping spots as well as the champs elysee which is way too crowded and infested with global chains gap and the like the hotel itself has a slight vintage feel and is very quiet and serene i hardly saw any people at all apart from a couple of friendly receptionists
