we couldn t believe how reasonably priced the room was the location was excellent right on the champs elysees a car park is available in an adjacent road and the metro a very short walk away the room was very well equipped we re not used to tea coffee making equipment in continental hotels clean and comfortable ifwe were staying more than night a room with a view would have been preferable
