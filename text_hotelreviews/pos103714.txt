great place could not fault anything short stroll to bus tube and restaurants managed to park right outside the door and as we stayed a saturday night only had to pay for a couple of hours parking for the whole weekend the room was very well appointed considering the price and spotlessly clean my wife loved the speaker system in the bathroom would definitely recommend to anyone needing a short stay in this area
