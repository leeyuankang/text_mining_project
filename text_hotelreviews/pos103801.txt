it was very good pigalle for those who do not know we didn t is a party area so it is a bit loud at night but the hotel rooms do a brilliant job of hiding this we had a minor problem on our first night with our original room but were quickly reaccomodated to another it is within walking distance of metro connections to get you around paris it is also not far at all to walk down to the centre if you want to do a touristic route i would reccomend this walk it goes to the west side of paris to arc de triomphe and then work east for everything else it was also just a couple metro jumps to get a train to disney and the same for a train if you are travelling elsewhere in france aswell we did not try a breakfast at the hotel but it smelt loveley we personnaly got attached to a little bakery across the road facilities were great shower was fantastic some rooms do have quite pokey bathrooms but it is not much of a problem the aircon was a life saver in the summer and was easy to use they also have televisions no english but no problem equally the staff were brilliant helpful and smiley and the hotel was spotless would certainly reccommend this hotel for most staying in paris
