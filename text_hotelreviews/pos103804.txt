the room was beautiful the windows were very sound proof it was so noisy with the windows open but once you shut it it was quiet rooms are adequately spaced for a french hotel two people could get around in it ok but sometimes it was cramped very very short walk to moulin rouge long walk to eiffel tower but doable lots of great restaurants within walking distance easily get taxis or metro
