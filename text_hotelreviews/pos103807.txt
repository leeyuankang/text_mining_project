we booked a privilege room which was modern and of a good size for paris hotel is located in front of pigalle metro station hence easy connection to gare du nord and other parts of paris sacre coeur is only a min walk away plenty of nice restaurants and boulangeries also within a min walk from the hotel very friendly and helpful staff free wifi worked well even though the hotel is located in the red light district of paris we did not feel unsafe in any way whilst walking around the area at night
