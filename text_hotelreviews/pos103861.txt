the staff were very friendly and polite the single room was comfortable and thoughtfully laid out a small thing that i particularly liked was that bottled water in the room which i drank was replaced by a fresh bottle when the room was cleaned something that many larger hotels fail to do i think it reflects the attention to detail the bed was comfy and the room on the back of the building very quite overnight even though i had the window open the decor is not the most contemporary but its a georgian building and it suits the style it was a great location and a good price for a central london hotel in july i will definitely book again
