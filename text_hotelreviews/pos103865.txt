excellent location for public transport access to city and stations and british museum and other cultural sites private garden areas in the hotel which were very pleasant and quiet nice to sit there with a complimentary newspaper or later in the summer evening with a drink from the hotel bar staff were always very helpful and welcoming room was also comfortable and a fair size optionally there was room service for meals which was an option for those on business travel etc
