i traveled with my year old daughter we liked the location because it was quieter than central london we had a twin room it was small but i think typical for england there were bus stops and underground stations close by one bus stop was across the street the british museum is an easy walking distance the room was clean comfortable and air conditioned when we visited in july it was hot the staff responded to requests quickly and politely there were good restaurants right around the corner the neighborhood felt safe even when coming back later at night after seeing a play the only time we ate there was after we got back late from a day trip to bath and stonehenge and ordered room service it was just what we needed it was generally quiet we had a room on the inside we could here people walking back and forth above us
