my single room was larger than i usually find in hotels it was clean and comfortable and the shower wasn t the tiny box that i usually get the location was very good for me very close to the british museum and oxford street the hotel has a largish garden with a fishpond and in the warmer weather it would be lovely to relax there the staff were all friendly and helpful i would certainly stay there again
