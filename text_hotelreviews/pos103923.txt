the hotel was expensive compared what they offer i got a room in the floor and there was no lift the hotel is old and there was a leakage of water from my bathroom to the underneath room also i didn t sleep well as there was noise form the central heating which disturb my sleeping i also requested a bottle of presecco to be in the room at the time of the arrival but there was not there you have got to ring a bell when you come back late night and the receptionist open the door himself and you can t leave the hotel as well until you call someone to open the main door the whole experience was not nice and i won t go back again
