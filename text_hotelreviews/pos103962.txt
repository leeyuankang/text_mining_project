great location attentive staff great value carlos had noted it was our anniversary upgraded our room to a suite at no extra cost he was really friendly made us feel welcomed guests thank you again the suite was really lovely although on the front the noise from the road wasn t a problem at all a lovely comfy bed we stayed in room will definitely stay there again
