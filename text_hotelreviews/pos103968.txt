staff were welcoming and efficient on arrival and departure obviously an old period property with charm and character but maintained very well and rooms were well appointed they were clean and had all if not more amenities than many larger hotels we have stayed at in london in the same area which is an ideal location to get around london tremendous value for money if you just want a comfortable place to lay your head whilst visiting london we will definately stay here again
