i like the the newly refurbishment of the rooms liking the view facing the city of london loving the centric location just behind regents street and walking distance to the heart and central of london of course not forgetting the warm welcome from the concierge and reception staffs were very polite friendly and allowing me to do my late check without charging an extra fee up until to i m loving it and will come back again whenever i m visiting london this place is definitely worth every penny that money well spent compared to other stars hotels which will make you pay to times the price of this
