the hotel was across the street from gare du nord a quick easy walk the entrance was challenging to locate because it was literally a small doorway nestled between two restaurants the doorman was accommodating and helped direct me to reception once checked in i was able to store my bag for the day the hop on hop off bus stop was again right across the street the room was nice but no shampoo i packed very light for a two day trip and took my shampoo out at the last minut i had to wash my hair with body wash located in the shower i also like a face cloth again there wasn t one in the room
