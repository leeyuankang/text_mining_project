the position of the hotel is excellent right opposite the gare du nord very close to metro access and above one of my favourite parisian restaurants namely the brasserie terminus nord rue de dunkerque my room was spotlessly clean well appointed and quiet the staff are very friendly and helpful particularly at reception the bagagiste was very good in organising a taxi for me to get to cdg airport in time for my flight home another good point is the availability of room service and the choice of food and drinks was quite a wide one it arrived promptly exactly as i had ordered and it was delicious
