the hotel is in a fantastic location if you will be using the gare du nord railway station as its directly opposite i had a room with two single beds but they were made up as a double so there was penalty of bed space the room was quite large and the bathroom was positively massive the room had tea coffee making facilities wireless internet and the desk had both a european and british power outlet just before you arrive check your room booking you might be able to change to a slightly different room type and save a bit of money the day before i arrived i switched from a double bed to two singles and saved about euros the two single beds were about the same as a double
