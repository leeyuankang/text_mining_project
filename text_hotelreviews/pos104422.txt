we re just off from our day tour and we ll be traveling back to amsterdam early next day i actually choose this hotel because it is near the north station but this was a great choice this hotel surrounded by restaurant and just by crossing the street you re at the north station staff were so accommodating and really attentive to their clients actually upon check in i have concerned because i accidentally left my backpack with video cam and camera inside the tour bus staff were so helpful to assist me on how to contact our tour guide to retrieve my bag to you all thank you well then recommend this hotel to my friends
