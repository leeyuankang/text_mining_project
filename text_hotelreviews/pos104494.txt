very nice hotel just outside gare du nord and the underground the room was very decent quite spacious for paris and the price i paid tea and coffee available in the room the bed was comfortable overall it was a great stay it is a typical mercure hotel a very reliable brand breakfast though at euros is worth it great choice of different things there s an old fashion feel about this hotel that i liked the room was ever so quiet which is a major plus in a city like paris
