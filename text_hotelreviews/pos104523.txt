the location is superb just opposite gare du nord makes it convenient for the accessability to public transport not to mentioned plenty of eatery near the hotel the room ive got was big and the view of gare du nord bed was spacious though it is twin beds combined walking distance to the city centre the kebab place next to the entrance was delicious may stay at this hotel again
