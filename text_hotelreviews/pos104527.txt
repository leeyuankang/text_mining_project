loved the location just over the road from gare du nord easy access to eurostar and other lines north on tgv lots of cafes close by with multiple languages so made easy for choosing food two sets of french doors which opened onto a balcony i loved it but others might not as was quite noisy being so close to the station the room was lovely a big and nice size bathroom
