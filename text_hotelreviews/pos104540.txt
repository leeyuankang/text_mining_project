the location is superb particularly for the paris metro the gare du nord and the gare de l est there is a wide variety of restaurants very close my room looked directly over to the gare du nord in itself a beautiful piece of architecture but because i was on a higher floor i also had a magnificent view of sacre coeur in montmartre the hotel staff were superb very helpful and attentive
