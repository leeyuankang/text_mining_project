i only needed a nights accommodation near gare du nord perfect location the reception i received was great the staff were really friendly and helpful as my french is pretty basic loved that they encouraged me with my french too i liked the external view out the windows the doors opened and it was nice with the breeze in the sheer curtains the bed was vey comfortable i thought the value for money was also excellent
