the staff are incredibly charming and welcoming the location is superb i arrived as a solo young female to gare du nord from london late at night and felt safe to get to the hotel the interiors are lovely and my balcony was a huge added bonus the very kind gentleman upgraded me as i had had a tough week couldn t recommend more i have stayed here a few times and wouldn t look elsewhere
