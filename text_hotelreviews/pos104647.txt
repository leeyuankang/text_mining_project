the mercure paris termnu nord is a very functional hotel with great value for money it is especially convenient for travellers who arrive or depart by train from the gare de nord as the station is bang opposite the hotel the room we stayed in was of a decent size with all the room amenities you would expect in a good hotel and also very clean the bed was very comfortable and even though the hotel is in a fairly busy area it was very quiet and we had a good night s rest there are a lot of cafes and good restaurants just outside the hotel so it was very convenient
