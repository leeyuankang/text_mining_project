very convenient to the gare du nord so we could access the eurostar and metro easily check in was handled well and we found all staff to be excellent lovely breakfast plenty of choice and a nice view of the classic station building opposite other meals need to be found outside the hotel but you are really spoilt for choice with so many nearby cafes and restaurants room was comfortable and clean we had the choice of an inside view quiet or a paris at night view not so quiet maybe we chose the quiet room and never heard a sound
