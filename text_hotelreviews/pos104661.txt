good location for getting to other parts of paris by metro and rer lines when they are running normally and a good selection of late night places to eat and drink nearby admittedly the room was a single but it was tiny there was tea coffee making facilities but no fridge not even one of those tiddly ones with overpriced miniature spirits thankfully the bed was slightly larger than many single rooms offer staff were ok but mostly didn t seem interested in doing anything to make your stay better most likely they feel they don t have to given the hotel s location the bathroom was functional but not well maintained soap dish hanging off the wall initially i booked one night of the three i was staying in paris so that i had the option of going elsewhere if it didn t suit i checked out and found a much better deal double room and cheaper in the overall ok but not great value given that paris hotels are the cheapest in ages
