the bed was very comfortable and since we were here for nights it was great breakfast was good everything you could want for breakfast was there the location was excellent so close to the gard de nord station just out the door and across the street literally minutes walk but it was a little noisy at night if you faced out onto the street there were so many eating places around the hotel so no problems there having to travel to eat the room did need a little tlc but overall comfortable and clean
