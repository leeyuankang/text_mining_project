perfect location for taking an early morning thalys train literally meters from the station despite the dodgy area around the hotel the hotel itself is safe and nice looking friendly personnel rooms are fine the bathroom needed some refurbishment but is decent for a short one night stay and this is not the hotel where you would spend much time
