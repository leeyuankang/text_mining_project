i got a really good deal on the room so my expectations were low i was very pleasantly surprised the staff were excellent i was made to feel very welcome my french isnt great but the staff were very understanding and let me have a go despite them all speaking excellent english the hotel was in a great location the hotel door is right next to a metro exit and opposite gare du nord which made leaving for an early flight so much easier the room was immaculate everything i could possibly need plus the room nice and warm i loved that i could adjust the heat and the bed was lovely and comfy i wish uk hotels were this standard
