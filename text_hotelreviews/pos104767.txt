i have stayed at this hotel a few times and will definitely do it again outstanding service politeness friendliness calmness and helpfulness in staff very accommodating they helped effectively in everything including an extra printout of a lost train ticket easy to chat with at all times of day all of the staff i am french though and don t know how they speak other languages very correct and clear handling of the reservations explaining every transaction i had several reservations for what turned out to be one stay for myself excellent luggage handling when leaving a suitcase for later retrieval you get a ticket and only staff is allowed to enter the luggage room to get the luggage with the counter ticket this may be a detail but makes me feel secure rooms have a bath tub a must for me and are very tidy location is really excellent
