since this was our first time to paris we didn t know what to expect especially during new years but upon arriving at this hotel we knew it was going to be an amazing experience the friendly helpful staff at the front could speak english and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed the room was clean spacious and very very comfortable our year old daughter slept very well on the pull out couch and we loved the size of the tub we had a beautiful city view from our window and it is very easy to walk from the hotel to many delicious cafes and bakeries for meals also being so close to gare du nord was wonderful for traveling anywhere in the city we would love to stay here again thank you so much
