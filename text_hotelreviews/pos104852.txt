we were in paris for four days and the hotel was ideally located opposite the gare du nord with metro and good restaurants directly outside we had a very busy itinerary so the location was ideal for us to quickly and easily travel around paris our room was comfortable spacious and had a great view overlooking the gare du nord we also enjoyed the breakfast at the hotel restaurant most importantly the hotel employees were very helpful courteous and knowledgeable in our opinion the hotel was a great place to stay and therefore good value for money we would definitely book this hotel again
