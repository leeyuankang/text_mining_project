love this place perfectly positioned for travel connections great comfort excellent breakfast selection and terrific staff all not costing an arm and a leg what more could you possibly want we had a floor room and the view out over the tops of the gare du nord statues and away to mont martre were lovely and there s even a bonus vertical green wall visible too lovely
