it was a hotel we had a beer or there and slept there the location was superb straight off the eurostar and no need to carry luggage round a city we didn t know the staff were friendly friday evenings barman was brilliant metro line was down and his directions to get to some tourist places was brilliant had he not told us we wouldn t have known cannot thank him enough we wanted to eat like locals so didn t eat at the hotel the whole place seemed very clean though we had zero view from our room but we didnt care hotels are for sleeping would definitely stay again if in paris or passing through
