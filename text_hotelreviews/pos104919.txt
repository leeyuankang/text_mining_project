this was extremely convenient for gare du nord where i arrived by eurostar it was very easy to find opposite one of the main exits from the railway station check in was straightforward i arrived late evening but there was time to visit the bar on the first floor this was a very pleasant experience i was able to have a nice relaxing drink in a quiet surround and i recommend it for other travellers staying here
