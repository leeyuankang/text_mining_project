the staff members particularly julia and paula were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our entire visit they offered wonderful suggestions helped with some language barriers and were generally always ready and willing to help in any way possible the accommodations were wonderful very stylish and comfortable and the breakfast was an added bonus we especially liked the quieter residential feel of the neighborhood around the hotel a welcome break from the noise and congestion of the middle of paris with ready access to the bus and the metro to get anywhere we wanted
