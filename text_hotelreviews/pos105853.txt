style of the hotel was quite quirky and we liked that mini spa was nice after a day out too the breakfast is expensive at euros each but there is a supermarket two streets down mins walk with other a fresh orange juice machine for a bottle and fresh croissants every morning we bought breakfast and walked or got the batobus to the eiffel tower to eat every morning the batobus stop is mins walk away just across the bridge brilliant for sightseeing and getting around easily
