location is perfect nice hotel slightly smal rooms on the top floor very very nice staff putting even sauna on for us althought its after and officially closed good breakfast for french understanding because in france you eat usually only croissant jam butter and a coffe here you had cheese sausages eggs fruits and so on nice design of the hotel
