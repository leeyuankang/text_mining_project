charming boutique hotel that embodies french feel while also offering the size comfort and facilities of a larger hotel my room was adorable with modern updates while maintaining french character location was perfect i really can t think of a more ideal location in paris right on top of shopping the louvre the siene etc hotel staff was warm and helpful air france had lost my bag so i was a bit stressed the desk spoke with some of the air france contacts as i was running into a bit of a language barrier the hotel moliere staff seemed much more invested in resolving the missing bag issue than air france did i think anyone who has been stuck in a foreign country without their belongings would really appreciate such assistance also the bed was awesome seriously
