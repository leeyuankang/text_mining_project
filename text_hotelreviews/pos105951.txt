firstly the location was so central for accessing everything we wanted to see by walking by metro and by tourist buses secondly the staff were wonderful you can help yourself to coffee and pastries every time you step in the door but if the staff see you they will offer to make your coffee they are delightful there is no bar but when we wanted to celebrate a special birthday the staff were more than happy to provide glasses and an ice bucket and we bought our own drinks at the shop over the road we sat and drank it in the cosy and comfortable seating area looking out onto a pretty courtyard we had opted for a room with a terrace which was on the floor it wasn t cheap but we do enjoy being able to step outside from our room and we weren t disappointed the terrace was spacious with plants at the sides and enough room for our friends to sit out with us around the patio table i regret that we didn t find time to enjoy the sauna etc it all looked very nice we tried the breakfast the first morning and it was so good we decided to have breakfast there every day they thought of everything i particularly enjoyed the fresh summer fruits little touches like the welcome gifts lovely spacious shower complimentary half bottle of champagne for my husband s birthday large flat screen tv and helpful advice on the desk at all times made the whole experience very special thank you hotel moliere
