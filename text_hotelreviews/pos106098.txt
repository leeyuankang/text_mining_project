we had to book this place when we found out that the other place we had booked in advance was a hell hole it was july saturday only a few offers left available we didn t have a choice so we booked this one the location wasnt t perfect but we found it easily min walk from acton town tube station it s good for travelling via heathrow airport the building looks lovely outside and fresh inside everything was new it was a pleasure to stay in shame just for a night comfy bed high tech lighting huge flatscreen tea coffee facilities mini fridge with bottles of water blinders and curtains good soundproof no bad smells and no little animals and the highlight was the bathroom with spacious area full toilette facilities including modern hairdryer and a perfect shower the pub on the ground floor was lovely we spent some time there too didn t have a breakfast though but i believe it would be nice and not expensive due to the menue we looked through you can also use morrisons just few steps to the right or other local pubs and mini shops to get some food and drinks i definitely recommend this hotel to people who can afford it or if there are special deals
