a beautiful boutique hotel that absolutely ticked every box the staff were all very polite and helpful the room was lovely i asked for a quiet room and my floor deluxe double was extremely well appointed with a luxury feel and a great modern bathroom my room size was compact but it really wasn t an issue the bedroom had a large led television and there was also a screen over the bath very swish the lighting in the bathroom was very good and made applying my makeup a breeze often a problem in other hotels there was no parking on site nor any street parking locally however i used justpark and managed to park off road nearby in a residential area overnight for and it was a minute walk away i had a chicken caesar salad for dinner and it was excellent best i ve had for years breakfast was truly superb the best english breakfast i ve had bar none sorry mum lovely morning staff too really made the start to the day a pleasure the bed was excellent and i had a terrific night s sleep with no noise from the street or other guests i found this hotel by chance and i wasn t too sure if acton was perhaps too far out from the city but the location was actually really good with swift access to and from the so it s without any hesitation i wholeheartedly recommend this lovely hotel to business users looking for high standards without any stuffiness i know you won t be disappointed
