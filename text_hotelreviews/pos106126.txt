staff is very polite and hospitable as far as the hotel is very new it s freshly clean and shiny great location on a high street near a big grocery shop which gives you plenty of places to eat just minutes to get to hyde park and oxford street pub on the ground floor can entertain you even in a rainy weather we very enjoyed staying at this place
