very clean and tidy hotel extremely welcoming on arrival by members of staff within the reception team that wished me and my partner a happy anniversary luxurious rooms throughout air conditioned with inch tvs and very nice bathroom with bath aswell as shower underfloor heating in bathroom which was great and very new tech designs from light switches to plug sockets so definitely an overall star stay very recommended and would come back breakfast was included with the stay which turned out to be very convenient upon checkout
