location was good and easy to get to sites it also is next door to the dominicans where mass is celebrated at noon daily hotel has real potential has private bathroom with a shower and tub carpet is worn and stained and needs to be replaced it gives a poor impression for the hotel as does the entry window curtains and paint peeling from building we will not stay here again unless the hotel has changed carpets nor will we use booking com since our expectations of the hotel was much higher than what we were led to believe on the internet
