this hotel has the best service and most friendly staff we ve ever had anywhere and we ve traveled around the world so this is really saying something staying here is more like being in a bed and breakfast or someone s home than a hotel because everyone treats you like you are a special and cherished guest everyone also speaks excellent english and they genuinely want to ensure that your visit to paris is perfect everyday there is a hour afternoon tea with free sweets savory snacks and non alcoholic beverages you can also purchase alcoholic drinks from the bar breakfast is amazing with hot eggs bacon beans and sausages not to mention fresh fruit breads and pastries yogurt and much more our room was large and comfortable and the beds were good the windows in both the room and the bathroom could be opened wide something i always appreciate the mini bar is stocked with a range of water soft drinks and fruit juice and it is free for the guests they do charge for refills but we didn t drink it all up in our four days here the fridge is large enough to hold a bottle of wine or two and the hotel will gladly provide a bucket of ice if you need to chill a bottle quickly the wifi is very good though you do have to sign in again each time you use it the hotel also offers a portable wifi device about the size of a deck of cards that you can carry with you as you explore paris this allows you to access the internet and googlemaps from anywhere as well as send photos to your friends at home to make them jealous the charge for this device is only one euro a day which is a fantastic deal it worked very well for us and we think it is a simply brilliant idea for a hotel to offer this to guests who may not have a local mobile phone the hotel is just a few blocks from the arc de triomphe in a quiet non touristy neighborhood there is a small grocery store in the same block and many restaurants and cafes nearby
