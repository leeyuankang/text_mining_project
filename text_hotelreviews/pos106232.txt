the staff were extremely friendly and yet professional the cocktail welcome in the early evening was a extra surprise before going out for a late dinner that alone was worth the price of the hotel breakfast was fabulous and the manager stopped by to enquire how we were doing nice touch room very spacious and clean big comfy bed location great min walk to metro and bus stops on the corner lots of shopping and restaurants in the area minute walk to champs elysees
