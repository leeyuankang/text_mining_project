the staff at etoile saint honor are simply amazing this includes everyone from receptionist to the hotel manager we only met kind faces which made us feel very welcome and at home they were all very concerned about our well being the location is excellent close to champs lys es but in a fairly quiet street breakfast was excellent with a wide choise of drinks and food we stayed in a junior suite which was very nice and spacious including restrooms we enjoyed the free minibar and the coffee maker in the room and the afternoon coffee in the reception too highly recommendable for the hospitality
