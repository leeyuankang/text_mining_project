the best bit about the stay was without a doubt the view from our room we had room which was one of the junior suites the view allowed us to see many landmarks including sacre coeur and the eiffel tower the room had a lovely little balcony with a table and two chairs which allowed us to have a quiet drink and meal on an evening with a spectacular view of the eiffel tower which when illuminated enhanced the already brilliant view twice during our stay the manager of the hotel phillipe spoke with us and asked us how our trip was so far and if we were enjoying our stay in the hotel and advised us on places to visit and how to get there as well as places to eat and drink i ve stayed in a few hotels and have never had the manager do this so to me this a lovely personal touch it wasn t just us either as we ate we saw him meet and greet other guests in the same manner clearly putting the effort in to ensure guests were happy with their stay the staff were friendly and helpful though my experience was limited with them as i didn t need to interact with them a great deal because there was nothing wrong with the hotel and we had all we needed however when i did deal with them they were helpful in anyway they could be and very polite too
