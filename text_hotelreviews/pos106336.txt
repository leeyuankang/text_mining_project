location was excellent really close to public transportation the luxembourg gardens lots of restaurants shops had a room facing the back overlooking the roof tops and it was quiet enough bedding was comfortable shower water pressure was good facilities were clean wifi worked well breakfast was available for euros per person although you can just go a few doors down to maison marie and get breakfast for euros
