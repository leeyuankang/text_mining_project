good nearby location if attending an event at the stade de france if driving into paris from the north e g from calais ferry crossing then this hotel avoids you driving in and out of central paris to avoid the traffic and lack of parking travelling into central paris was very easy by train as the metro was only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel hotel was nice and the staff friendly
