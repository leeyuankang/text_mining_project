i was attending a conference at the philharmonie so this hotel was perfectly located for convenience to that event while also being moments away from the metro so paris was easily accessible the roof top restaurant had a stunning view of the city and the breakfast there had a wide selection of delicious food the staff were friendly and helpful ready to assist with any problems immediately my room was beautiful great comfortable beds with plenty of space to hang up my clothes a desk space to work at and a great tv best of all a long bathtub and an infinite supply of hot water to soak in after each days activities i highly recommend it
