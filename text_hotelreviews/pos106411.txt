the room was comfortable and a good size for adventurous travelers what i mean is it is a good base and place to sleep for travelers that like to get out and about and spend most of the time outside of the hotel the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was just fine as well the location a hundred meters or so from a metro station was great because the hotel is just outside of the busy and more expensive part of the city but with easy access to everything via metro there is a cheaper breakfast offer instead of the standard breakfast this one is and includes a coffee croissant and a juice i think
