the staff were all very friendly and helpful upon check in the man at the front desk gave me a map of the subway and helped me figure out how to use the metro the location of the hotel was great as well it was across from a park the music museum and the philharmonic i was in town to see a concert the subway was a minute s walk from the front door the neighborhood didn t seem very touristy and there were several nice restaurants nearby along with a nice little grocery store where i was able to buy reasonably priced snacks and wine
