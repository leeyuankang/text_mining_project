the weather was extremely hot when i arrived at this facility there was a very nice cooling unit in the room when i arrived and somehow when i returned later in the evening after meeting clients the cooling unit had disappeared from the room the staff could not tell me how this was removed in addition this hotel needs total renovation as the decor and accommodations are very smoky and old
