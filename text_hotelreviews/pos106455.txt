good location with free parking for genius members the underground parking is very tight and i recommend you ask for assistance from the staff before attempting to park i drive a hyundai sonata and was able to find a nice spot i also saw suv s underground in the same area its a short walk to the arc de triomphe and the metro the staff are very professional and friendly
