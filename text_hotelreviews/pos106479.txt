the location right near champs lys e was ideal for the entire city there were two convenient metro stations nearby and bus stops very close to arc de triomphe we had an apartment for the family of the kitchen is not equipped to cook a meal just simple breakfast or snack the bathroom was nice as well except that the hairdryer mounted on the wall didn t work but they loaned me another one
