the staff were exceptional i had a large international party of friends and family over for a celebration and they all mentioned how great the staff were and how clean their apartments were it was the first time we d stayed in that part of paris the hotel is well situated and has a beautiful park around the corner perfect for our picnic i highly recommend royal garden as price wise it s also very reasonable for the facilities and service provided i d certainly stay here again
