having read some reviews i was extremely worried about the hotel and the room but i was pleasantly surprised the executive room was very nice the bed was comfy and the bathroom was ok i could see the eiffel tower from my bedroom and had a small balcony the wifi worked very well the staff were very helpful and polite i did not eat there so could not comment on the food minutes away from the arc de triomphe and champs elysees
