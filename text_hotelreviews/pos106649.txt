we stayed for days and interacted with or staff members they were all friendly helpful and good at their jobs the location of this hotel was fantastic it was so nice to be able to cross the road to the gardens go just around the corner to find lovely places to eat and also only a minute very pleasant walk from the eiffel tower along the river
