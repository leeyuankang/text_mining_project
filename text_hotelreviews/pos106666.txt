staff was very helpful with great recommendations for restaurants and especially helpful with airport arrangements be aware it takes minutes or more to get to the airport and you will need at least hours at cdg to get through security the staff guided us through the timing to be sure we wouldn t run into trouble the hotel is perfectly situated for walking to major sites and areas of paris the room was extremely comfortable can t wait to go back
