i and my husband stayed in this hotel for one night the receptionist who welcomed us upon our arrival was the most elegant gentle and professional hotel receptionist we ve ever met his posture was very warm and welcoming the check in was so smooth and once he knew that we are japanese he started talking to us in japanese his japanese was very fluent and almost perfect and we were absolutely impressed on the next day after check out we realised that my husband has left his sunglasses so i went back to the hotel to pick it up i was attended by the same receptionist and to my surprise he remembered our room number even after checkout and i received my husband s sunglasses within one minute during our stay he was extremely patient with my very bad french and he even praised me my french is absolutely broken we were constantly impressed by his extraordinary services it was our last night in paris and was definitely the best one hats off for the five star customer services
