the staff was super friendly and helpful we were anxious about not knowing the language but the staff put us at ease instantly the furnishings and decor of our room were so classic french it was delightful the nespresso machine in our room and the chocolates in the evening were wonderful we also loved the thick fluffy towels and the spaciousness of the room we were adults parents with adult daughters and the large king bed and the sleeper sofa were both very comfortable from this hotel it was an easy walk to the louvre the seine river and the tuilleries garden both in front of our hotel were amazingly beautiful places to linger and people watch behind the hotel we discovered lots of restaurants to explore only a block from the hotel are several bakeries chocolate shops and souvenir shops yet our immediate location was quiet we really enjoyed the hotel its staff and its location
