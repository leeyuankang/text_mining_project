the location is amazing we loved our tuileries garden view definitely worth the extra money the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was simply decorated and small but very elegant the bathroom toiletries and water pressure were great we didn t have the breakfast we would definitely stay here again because of the spectacular view of the eiffel tower and more
