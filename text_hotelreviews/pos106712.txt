loved everything about this hotel all the staff we had met were friendly and always had a smile location is great walking distance to everything and i mean all attractions hotel itself is petite but i actually loved the contemporary feeling of it the room is a standard european size room which had double doors that overlooked other buildings courtyard not the prettiest view but we didn t care we were in paris the bed was comfy and the room also had a spacious bathroom with lots of bench space the shower was a nice surprise it was huge and the best part was that the room had a complimentary nespresso coffee machine we have one at home so it felt like home i will definitely be staying here again
