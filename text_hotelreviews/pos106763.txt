the staff are fabulous and lovely very friendly and outgoing and they would do their best to accommodate their guests it felt like home personally i hate the hassle of hotels but this hotel has a special touch the warm welcome the friendly faces makes you feel like wanting to stay longer or must visit again i will definitely stay with hotel brighton on my next visit to paris
