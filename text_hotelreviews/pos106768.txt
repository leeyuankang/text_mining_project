we had the tiny room with views of the eiffel tower and garden the bed was comfortable and it was quiet enough despite overlooking a busy road staff was accommodating even though the room was compact the bathroom was spacious with nice toiletries and fresh towels shower pressure was good lighting and heating good i would stay here again and is one of the better four star hotels in the center
