the staff was the best i have ever had in a hotel experience bravo the breakfast was a bit pricey but excellent the location for sightseeing purposes was perfect you could walk to almost anything and access to the easy to use metro stations was close we did not have the most expensive room in the facility but we still a fairly large room
