i chose this hotel because of the booking com reviews and the fact it had private parking facilities and was within walking distance of bastille the absolute best thing was the incredibly comfortable bed i have never slept so well moreover our room was quiet no waking up early to street cleaning or noisy refuse collections staff were cheerful and went out of their way to be helpful
