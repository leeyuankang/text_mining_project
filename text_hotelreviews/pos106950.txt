due to a medical issue we had to remain in paris longer than we planned and needed a hotel that was suitable to recuperate afterwards we found hotel boutet was close to where we had previously stayed in an apartment and chose to book in we had stumbled onto a real gem every aspect of the hotel was more than excellent the staff were always friendly and accommodating and could not do enough to help the rooms were impeccably clean and the bed was the best we have ever slept on in a hotel all the facilities provided in the hotel were excellent and we would definitely stay here again we absolutely recommend hotel boutet to anyone wishing to stay in paris
