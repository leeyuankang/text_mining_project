stayed here for the weekend with my mum and would highly recommend it overall this is a beautiful hotel it s well located with good transport links and great shopping and food options nearby and the staff are friendly and helpful at all times in particular decio at reception when we were checking in and the concierge daniel during our stay there was a small issue with our room but it didn t negatively impact our stay at all as it was dealt with efficiently by the staff with almost no inconvenience to us the lighting in the rooms is the standout feature and creates a beautiful and relaxing ambiance
