i went to the montcalm royal london house with my brother for the weekend and i was totally pleased with the stay we were welcomed with a glass of prosecco and the woman at the reception was very friendly and helpful the room was just perfect the bed is huge and comfortable the bathroom is spacious the shower is amazing and even the tv is larger than at every other hotel i ve ever been to the whole hotel is very new and modern but it still made me feel very cozy the spa is fantastic there is a pool a whirlpool a sauna and a steam bath and i think you can have various massages and treatments another highlight of the hotel is the rooftop bar aviary you have an amazing view over london and the cocktails taste fantastic the location of the hotel is very good but you have to know that some stores are closed at the weekend because it s in the financial district but it s not a big problem because it s also very close to shoreditch a vivid neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants stores clubs and pubs
