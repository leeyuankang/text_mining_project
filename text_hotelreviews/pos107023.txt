this is a new hotel and it is very modern we were very impressed with the facilities including sky tv in the room safe and minibar the bathroom was very clean and had a great shower including underfloor heating the room was operated by a very modern touch screen interface great bar downstairs serving snacks and drinks with a couple of table games not sure what they were though there is also a restaurant at the top level with roof top bar which is impressive there is parking in a ncp right outside which is discounted by the hotel for a hotel of this standard i thought it was remarkably good value breakfast was downstairs and good although fruit wasn t offered in this buffet although i think if asked for it would be supplied can t fault it
