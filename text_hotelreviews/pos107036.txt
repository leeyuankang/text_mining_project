staff were brilliant very friendly smiley but also very professional we felt very welcome when we checked in and also were given a glass of something refreshing and fizzy as we checked in a great start to our weekend rooftop bar is fantastic and a real destination bar however it is a little expensive we were without our children but noted that there were families there and the downstairs bars were very family friendly we thought that you could go in there with the children play some games and have a few drinks better than the usual of being confined in the room with them in the evening
