super friendly staff very nice terrace on the roof great dinner at restaurant nearby kind of funny to be in the midst of all those banks and find a cheerful indian restaurant with excellent food easy to hop on tubes as the hotel is near liverpool street station and even nearer to moorgate had breakfast nearby choice between different brands rooms nice and quiet when it comes to noice from inside the hotel that was excellent
