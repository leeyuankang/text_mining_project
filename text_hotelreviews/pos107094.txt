this is a very classy hotel the decoration was modern and sometimes quirky all staff were extremely friendly it has an excellent terrace bar and restaurant we were upgraded to a suite with no extra charge in which the bed was one of the most comfortable i had ever slept it is very central good for travelling from the north of england as extremely close to euston by tube we had a great stay and will be back
