very polite and pleasant customer care service i felt so at ease the bed however was a little annoying as it was two single beds pushed together i did order a room with a double bed i didn t complain though as the staff were extremely nice would definitely go back there again great location plenty of bars and restaurants near by roof top garden in the hotel was lovely
