bed was extremely comfortable lovely bathroom with waterfall shower great tv media options good mini bar excellent room service i had something also available at burdock restaurant and my plate was much larger than in the restaurant which made the tray charge worth it i just wanted the comfort of my own room as staying alone i did enjoy a few cocktails in the bar beforehand and they were great and i felt comfortable there on my own
