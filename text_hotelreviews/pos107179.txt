the hotel was very modern with high tec facilities but it was the staff that made my visit incredible nothing was too much for them they had put gifts in my room for my special event which involved a great amount of thought and research on their part the spa was gorgeous lovely pool and jacuzzi i can t recommend this hotel highly enough in fact i have booked to go again i wouldn t use any other hotel now when i visit london
