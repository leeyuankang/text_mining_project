the location was good especially for anyone flying in via stansted airport or anyone travelling via liverpool street the bed was very comfy i especially loved that they provided a cellphone with unlimited data local calls and etc as to the hotel it is very new so that might be why but i found the staff though friendly and helpful to be quite inexperienced and slightly awkward at times
