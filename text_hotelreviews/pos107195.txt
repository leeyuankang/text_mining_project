i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough the staff could not be more helpful and the rooftop bar provided stunning views of the city upon entering my room i was greeted with an array of cakes fresh fruit prosecco and a card wishing me a happy birthday the location was great and the rooms were beautifully decorated the perfect choice to celebrate my birthday a big thank you to the staff of montcalm royal london house for helping to make it so special
