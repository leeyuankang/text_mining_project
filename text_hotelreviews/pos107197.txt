i liked that the staff worked hard to make sure that our stay was good and to rectify the hiccups with our room and room service order the breakfast which was comped as restitution for the room service mishap was pretty good but the lack of selection meant that i got weary of the full english after a couple days i also liked that the hotel is trying to use technology in new and interesting ways even if the end result didn t quite hit the mark i connected my tablet to the tv and was able to listen to music nicely the bathroom was beautiful and the shower was great lastly the location of this hotel as plusses and minuses on the plus side it is located a short walk to a couple of underground stations and from the shoreditch area on the other hand in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is not much in the name of fun still we enjoyed walking to shoreditch on one evening and to the tower of london during one of our tourist adventures
