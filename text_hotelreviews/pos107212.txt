great room modern touch lighting brand new bathroom all newly refurbished a real pleasure to stay here we took advantage of the rooftop bar which was still warmly heated on a chilly december evening by outdoor heaters with blankets provided in all seating areas had delicious cocktails nibbles overlooking a foggy beautifully atmospheric city skyline we didn t eat in the restaurant also up on the roof as we were meeting friends elsewhere but it looked great staff seemed super friendly there s also a great spa on the lower ground floor which we didn t have time to sample but again really great facilities i d love to stay here again perhaps for a little longer next time great hotel we really enjoyed our stay
