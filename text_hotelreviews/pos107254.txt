the welcome from the staff was great surprisingly remembered my name and face from a visit to a previous hotel from the group i was early and they accommodated me with a glass of bubbly and quickly got me checked in an hour before i was due to a room that felt like an upgrade the room was spacious and the bed was outrageously comfortable could have spent a week in it wonderful waterfall shower was enough to tempt me out of bed and wake me up and the views from the rooftop bar for a night cap were excellent the sort you would have to pay good money for near by the location is also extremely convenient for visiting many great sights shopping areas and restaurants bars we were also lucky to get a great deal two nights for the price of one in a hotel of similar standard in a similar location
