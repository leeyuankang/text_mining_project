the staff were absolutely amazing in accommodating our needs and were very attentive to any requirements we had the room was exceptionally clean and staff were constantly asking as we entered and left the hotel throughout the day if we needed anything location is spot on i would definitely advise anyone travelling to london to stay here also try the bacon buttie in the small food area downstairs located near reception it tastes sensational
