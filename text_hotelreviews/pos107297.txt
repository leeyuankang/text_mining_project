we had a mini staycation for our year anniversary and we were delighted to be given a free room upgrade as well as some yummy goodies and a lovely card the room was positively palatial and the bed was enormous the latter much appreciated after a long week at work just down the road the staff were extremely helpful and couldn t have been more apologetic about the areas not yet open thank you for a lovely stay
