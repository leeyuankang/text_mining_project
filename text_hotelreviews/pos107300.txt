the hotel were so thoughtful spelling happy birthday in rose petals for my girlfriend greeted with bubbly when we checked in daniel d helped alot when we returned a little bit drunk and couldn t get into our room the shower was amazing also the way the tv works with bluetooth and smart tv were handy also but the location being so close to the nightlife of shoreditch and the business centre of the city makes it a great pick for both leisure and business
