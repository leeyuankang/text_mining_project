lovely stay at the hotel it was our anniversary and we stayed in a family room with another couple the hotel left a card champagne and rose petals on the bed it was very sweet and gave us a wonderful experience our bed was super comfy and our friends that stayed in the other room on the pull out couch said it was pretty comfortable would definitely stay again
