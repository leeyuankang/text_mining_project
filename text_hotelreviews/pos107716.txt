doorman was extremely helpful and helped us get cheaper parking about walk away from the property we received complimentary wine on arrival our fav part was probably the lounge we gained access to because of our suite it allowed us to use the meeting room facilities when my partner and i had some business calls to attend to but it also served a fabulous afternoon tea that i thoroughly enjoyed their scones were to die for breakfast was fine not too many kosher options unfortunately but i m sure this wouldn t be a problem for most guests
