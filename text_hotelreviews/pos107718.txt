it was a jewel box of a room not overly large but clean and luxurious and cozy with every amenity we could possibly need the bed and bedding were amazing and the decor was warm and modern i asked for a quiet room and we never heard any other sound while in our room we slept like babies felt very pampered and the location cannot be bettered just steps from the st james park tube station after a long day touring and walking there was nothing better than knowing our hotel was right there beside the tube station and we loved being so close to westminster and st james park the neighborhood is close to everything yet without all the hoards of tourists and noise you can get in london we loved it and would definitely stay again
