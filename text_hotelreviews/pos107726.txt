the location was excellent walk to westminster abbey the london eye bus tour the room was very comfortable the shower was excellent the only bad thing was if you want a small ice bucket or a beer you can t bring it up from the bar you need to call room service thought that was a bit crazy the concierge service was great a bit posh but really nice the sheets towels pillows were great quality a lovely stay
