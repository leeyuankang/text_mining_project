what s not to like the location was perfect everything was spotlessly clean the room was fantastic with large tv large bathroom and great facilities nothing was to much trouble for the incredibly friendly checking staff the breakfast had a good selection and the sausages were very tasty would definitely stay in the hotel again in the future
