there was a market across the street for several days which provided some fun shopping experience i will say that the market does leave behind a lot of trash at the end of each day but it gets cleaned it didn t bother us in the least the staff was friendly most of the time the beds were very comfortable there have been several ppl stating they felt this area was unsafe we never felt unsafe at any time
