the room was clean and very quite i was in the floor carrefour is so close to the hotel metro line station porte de montreuil is minutes walk from the hotel note the hotel is located east of paris so plan your trip well as it maybe far from your needs for example it will take you around minutes to reach eiffel tower by metro
