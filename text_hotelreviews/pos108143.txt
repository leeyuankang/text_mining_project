very good stay at the hotel very comfortable neat and clean rooms and very spacious staff is very friendly and cooperative i left my laptop charger in the room itself on checkout have sent an email to the hotel for the same hope to receive it back would certainly recommend this hotel has good metro connections to major parts of the cities direct line to eiffel tower and champs elyssees
