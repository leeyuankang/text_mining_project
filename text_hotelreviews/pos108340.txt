we were there for the saturday iron maiden concert and so i really liked how close the hotel is to the arena just a short walk and a single stop on the tube and we were there that meant that the return journey was quick and effortless when we were tired and aching the beds were very comfortable and the room had air conditioning which on such a warm day was very welcome i was there with my year old son and i felt completely safe walking through the area late at night on our way back to the hotel the area in general has a nice relaxing and safe feel to it and i would definitely feel happy to stay there again another bonus was that the hotel felt safe and secure the lifts to the guest floors are accessed by using the key card to your room and so can t be accessed by anyone who isn t a guest plus at night there is someone at the door checking key cards to ensure only guests can access the lobby
