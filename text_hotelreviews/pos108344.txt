we booked a nights stay at this hotel for the weekend of our wedding although the wedding ceremony and reception was not held in the hotel the staff still upgraded us when they learned we were there for our wedding also on the wedding day when we came back to the hotel for the night we were happily surprised to find roses petals all over our bed with some petals arranged to draw a heart they also left us a plate of strawberries covered in chocolate it was all really nice attentions for us and we truly appreciated the gesture and our stay at the hotel thanks again
