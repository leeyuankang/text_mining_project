we stayed here overnight for the london marathon my daughter participated in it to raise money for her charity project sulangan for the deprived children in a village in the philippines the hotel was brilliant the staff could not do enough for us and the runners of the marathon from the atmosphere to the food everything were geared for the marathon runners we checked out after breakfast on the morning of the marathon they offered us if we would like to come back to freshen up the location along the river next door to the train just perfect if we go to london for a weekend this would be perfect away from the hectic hustle and bustle of the city yet just a few minutes on the train perfect
