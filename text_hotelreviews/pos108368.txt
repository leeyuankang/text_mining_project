we were there for the london marathon the staff had hand written notes on gift bags for all of the runners checking in that included items like running gels epsom salt coconut water water and other snacks check in time was pretty busy being that there are only so many computers to check people in however those that were not checking people in were going through the line offering mocktails and chocolates while chatting with the guests i also loved how they offered a breakfast early in the morning specific for those running in the marathon and they know how we runners eat breakfast when some people are going to bed from the night before they also had a table of water and bananas in the lobby the morning of the race just a fantastic place to make us all feel so welcome
