the breakfast was excellent you could take your time over it the staff were amenable and helpful nothing was too much trouble even catered for dietary needs such as soya milk for cereal and gluten free options i also particularly loved the size of the bed i could literally starfish and not bump into my partner at all the room was blissfully quiet at night this was a room that overlooked the atrium no view really but didn t matter as we were out a great deal the room was well equipped iron hard wire for internet plenty of mirrors and sockets also the bathroom mirror was heated which meant it never steamed up brilliant
