we moved the stuff from the fridge to put are own stuff in it and it was motion censored so they then wanted to charge us for everything in the fridge they locked the fridge and we had to ask them to unlock it so we could take are own items out we had already asked them to remove all items and they still tried to charge us for the whole mini bar and they had already taken it all away we had to then wait in a long line for a refund unfortunately we also had a very noisy room opposite the railway having stayed in star hotels i feel this was not anywhere close we will not be returning very disappointed
