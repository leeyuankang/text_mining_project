staying for the evening prior to the prudential bike ride we heard the gm of the hotel is a cyclist at was particularly noticeable that alot of thought had gone into making the stay for riders well managed the storage and safety of guests bikes was first class having a bike maintenance facility on site was way beyond expectation and amazing service the collection of bikes in the early morning was incredibly efficient and smooth running the welcome pack for riders was a lovely touch opening the breakfast facilities from so riders were able to eat was fantastic the rider specific evening menu was a good idea providing guidance maps of how to get from the hotel to the ride start was great we followed the route which was a little sketchy along the canal with road bike tyres but again over and above service use of the executive lounge was worth paying the extra for canap s and desserts were lovely just a shame we were not drinking alcohol during our stay to enjoy a wine with the beautiful sunset our stay was extremely enjoyable and smooth running exactly what you need before a big ride thank you
