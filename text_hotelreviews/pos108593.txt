very helpful staff clean room and in the centre of canary wharf very good breakfast lots of choices everything was very fresh great location when visiting london perfect if you need to go to greenwich for walking if you do upgrade your room to an executive one don t forget that the executive lounge has the most perfect view of west india quay and is a very nice quiet corner to relax
