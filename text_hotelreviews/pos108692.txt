had a slight problem with our room not being ready and we were offered a disabled room then another with the air conditioning stuck on that said when we went back to reception to say this was not suitable we were given an upgrade to a lovely room on the sixth floor with great views sara in reception was lovely and a credit to the company breakfast was awesome and the chocolate bunny by the bed for easter was a nice touch
