we were late for breakfast on our last day i asked at the breakfast station for a waffle i was informed it would be minutes the waitress told me to sit down and she would bring it when it was ready i was expecting quarter waffles and some syrup instead i had the waffles some fresh fruit strawberries raspberries etc the syrup and a large portion of clotted cream even though we were the last ones there they went to the trouble of giving me a really lovely breakfast with no indications that they wanted us to eat up quickly a lovely end to our stay
