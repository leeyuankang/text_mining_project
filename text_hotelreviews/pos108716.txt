we upgraded to a suite the view was fab and the beds were comfy we ordered breakfast in the room as it can be seriously busy in the restaurant in the mornings the breakfast which was delivered was amazing and too much for us to eat the location is great with bars and places to eat around and also close to the tube and dlr staff are always very helpful and friendly parking very close by is a bonus
