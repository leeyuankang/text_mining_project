bed was amazing room was perfect staff were very helpful even the hall porter there s a touch of class and it feels very high end in a great location but without the price tag overall we got an absolute bargain will definitely be looking at staying there again we stay in hotels quite frequently and nothing s matched london marriott west india quay so far very happy customers
