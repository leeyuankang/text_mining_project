booked this hotel for christmas eve trip to the theatre etc hotel staff were welcoming and nothing was too much for them right next to the tube station and close to canary wharf which made a lovely christmas morning walk seeing historic parts of london in a leisurely pace once we checked out they seemed in no hurry for us to leave and our meal in the g and t bar was exceptional ncp parking is a three minute walk from the hotel would i use this hotel again oh yes
