the fact we got upgraded because our room wasn t ready and we needed to get ready and go out asap was lovely i literally couldn t fault anything apart from there wasn t a toilet brush in the room but the hotel was amazing if i was going to the again i would not hesitate to stay here again staying at another hotel would never cross my mind and what can i say about the breakfast so much option so tasty and i would return just to have breakfast thank you for an amazing stay really made our weekend
