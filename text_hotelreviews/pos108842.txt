the hotel is visually impressive the lobby area and rooms are presentable and well equipped with a very pleasant bar and restaurant area the location is a double edged sword fantastic to access both docklands and jubilee line trains within a few minutes walk however this does mean some less than attractive scenery from some rooms tube lines and concrete the other sides of the hotel however lead to a beautiful area well equipped with eateries and bars lining the river the delightful cabot place shopping centre and the square replete with fountains and seating overall delightfully placed for seeing a side of london most tourists never see
