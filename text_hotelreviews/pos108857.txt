staff were extremely welcoming polite and helpful i was riding in the prudential on sunday august so was not around on the sunday morning to check out with my wife i was therefore most impressed that one member of staff took the time to carry our bag s to our car in the car park over the road great service we were also greeted with a welcome drink prior to checking in at reception arrangements for bike storage were also excellent and very secure
