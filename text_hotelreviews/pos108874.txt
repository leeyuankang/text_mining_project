i was staying over the weekend of the ride london surrey for the third year that must say something about how much i rate this hotel its staff and its facilities they are so geared up to meet the needs of keen cyclists many of whom have stupid o clock start times and so need an early breakfast not many hotels will get staff in for and not charge anything extra either the whole experience makes for a hugely relaxing time apart from the ride
