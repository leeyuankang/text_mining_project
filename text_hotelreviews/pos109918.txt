i was with my mom this time and when we reached the hotel after a long flight i asked them to see the room before paying the full amount to ensure that we will get a good room but they refused they said that we have to pay fully when we went to the room the room seemed to be very small and narrow and i my aim in this vacation is to let my mom feels comfortable and enjoying everything and the room was really too small so i had to go down again and i asked them to show me a better room as before i booked a room with the same category but it was much bigger than this so they showed me another room with the same category but it was better than that room the thing is that in this room the cabinets was near the toilets and not like the previous room when the cabinets were near the bed and there was no space for us to move so from the beginning they had to give us a good room as they saw me with my mom and at least they had to think about doing their best to let her feel comfortable in the room
