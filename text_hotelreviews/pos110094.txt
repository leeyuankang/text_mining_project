we stay here quite often when i am working in london usually for only one or two nights at a time superb location for access to most of the key areas to visit and handy for several underground lines staff are always friendly and helpful and the ability to leave luggage post checkout we usually travel back late evening is a big plus for us the views across london from rooms on the higher floors are also amazing
