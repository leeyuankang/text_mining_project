we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite so the whole experience was awesome the receptionist was fantastic and had done this because our scheduled room wasn t quite ready but rather than make us wait which we had been quite happy to do she looked to see what else was available we were only staying the one night so this was really above and beyond regrettably i didn t note down the young lady s name this hotel is superbly place for all of london s many attractions and whilst being very upmarket it never makes you feel uncomfortable the staff are polite and friendly and the hotel is always immaculately kept
