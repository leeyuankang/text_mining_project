the room was small but clean and comfortable the staff were very helpful unfortunately i had a number of problems with the room the television did not work apparently the cleaners had knocked the cables out the phone was broken and needed replacing and the safe would not open all of these issues were resolved but led to a rather stressful evening when i was getting ready to go out i felt all of these issues should have been checked and resolved before the room was declared ready for use the worse problem was the overpowering smell of drains sewage from the bathroom the housekeeper came and used an air freshener which only helped for a few minutes overall a rather disappointing experience
