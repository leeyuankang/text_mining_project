the staff couldn t do enough for you even the doorman was super friendly which certainly makes a change in london the breakfast was definitely worth the money with so much to choose from and laid out brilliantly the room was lovely and we were given an upgrade on arrival the location of the hotel was perfect just a short stroll from the shops and hyde park and less than minutes from the tube perfect
