staff very friendly and helpful security was good you needed your room key card to activate the lift and there was a free safe to use in the room wifi was also free to use there is a leisure facility which looked nice but we didn t get the chance to visit it a great place to use as a base for travelling all around london within walking distance for marble arch and baker st tube stations close to madam tussauds the sherlock holmes experience and oxford st for shopping breakfasts well presented and plentiful
