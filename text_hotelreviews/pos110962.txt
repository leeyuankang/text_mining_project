croissants were delicious not warm but very nice location is perfect subway opera with lines crossing roissybus stop from to cdg close enough to the louvre the vend me square gallery lafayette is a min walk the hotel is situated in a quiet place that makes it comfy the price it s pretty high for us but as i can see not so high for paris itself so i now rate it as plus gel shampoo body milk and gel for hands in bathroom very good for hotel really guys it s great in spite of some minuses that always can be in hotels like this i would recommend this hotel for a short staying in paris
