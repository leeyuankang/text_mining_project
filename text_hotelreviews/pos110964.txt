our room was very bright with the sunshine pouring in from two large windows there was enough space even for a family of three as in our case the bathroom was also spatious the room and the hotel in general were very clean breakfast was typical french with freshly baked pastry french cheese fresh fruit joghurt etc there are several common rooms on the ground floor and the basement where one can relax after a tiresome day in paris the location is great the opera and the louvre museum are within walking distance whereas there are several very good brasseries and japanese restaurants nearby the staff was very friendly and helpful i think that it is a very good choice for families on a budget especially if you want to stay in this specific paris neighborhood
