our room no was just beautiful i was concerned from previous reviews that the rooms would be tiny and facing onto the street would be noisy this was not the case at all everything was very clean and the staff very helpful and friendly i also loved the l occitane products in the bathroom one of the best aspects of the hotel is the area so many wonderful cafe s restaurants and shops on the doorstep a really wonderful hidden gem of a hotel great value for money and i could not recommend it more
