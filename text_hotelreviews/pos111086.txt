this hotel is in an great location on the left bank but just a short walk over the bridge to notre dame located in a quiet street but right near the intersection of bvd saint germain and bvd saint michel the louvre and musee d orsay are within a comfortable minute walk lots of restaurants and bars nearby although many are very touristy the property appears to have been renovated recently and the facilities are very modern whilst i know from looking at the rooms plan for the hotel that not all accommodations are created equal our room number was extremely spacious and comfortable rates on booking com reasonable by expensive paris standards staff were excellent especially carolina who worked hard to get us access to our room after an early morning arrival from australia
