brilliant location in central paris near the seine lovely adjoining rooms perfect for a family with a view of the saint severin church very helpful and friendly staff and very accommodating for children clean and furnished to a good standard with a lovely petit prince gift for our little boy and chocolates for us good big monoprix nearby and some lovely restaurants although you have to work out which of the restaurants are tourist traps vs genuinely good french restaurants
