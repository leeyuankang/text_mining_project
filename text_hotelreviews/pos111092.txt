boutique classic in the heart of the vibrant latin quarter the staff were exceptional and so friendly polite and helpful our room was well apointed and featured a beautiful little terrace overlooking saint severin the pantheon and the classic roof tops of paris sitting on the terrace over easter listening to the church bells ring out from notre dame was unforgettable the location was great close to so many wonderful sights yet it was quiet and peaceful at night there are lots of food options of all prices close by as well as parks and less touristy spots to enjoy i would highly recommend this lovely hotel we usually stay in an apartment when we have visited in the past but as we were only staying days we decided on a hotel and we could not have been more pleased with our choice loved it
