we were on the top floor of the hotel with a panoramic view of paris absolutely beautiful it was a little too cold to lounge on the terrace but we were able to sit in the sun for a while and admire the eiffel tower and many more buildings the room was large the bed comfortable breakfast was plentiful and delicious everyone was extremely friendly the location in the latin quarter was perfect easy access to the subway as well as to many restaurants in the area great atmosphere in the evening to go out for a stroll we had a wonderful stay
