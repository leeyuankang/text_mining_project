great location near really good restaurants in very close proximity to the river seine because it s a small hotel it s lovely and quiet and felt very private so i would highly recommend for a single or couples holiday very helpful friendly staff decent room size with a good shower and shower products comfortable bed a great big terrace with table and chairs and pretty flowers perfect for relaxing in the evening after a long day of sightseeing the hotel also organised my shared taxi pickup to the airport which i d recommend doing as it s much cheaper than getting one out on the street so be sure to ask just leave extra time for other hotel pickups
