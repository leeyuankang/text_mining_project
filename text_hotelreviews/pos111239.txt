often travelling to paris for business trips i was impressed by the quality of the chavanel hotel without breakfast during the fashion week in march everything was perfect from the reception staff to the modern and refined decoration the confortable bed the room size for paris etc the hotel is super close from the madeleine which is very practical for tourists too would definitely recommend it and come back
