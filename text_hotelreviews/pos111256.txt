we loved our stay at the portobello not only was the location and street picture perfect the staff were wonderful and our room we were delighted to have been upgraded to what was described to us as famous room with its gorgeous yellow wallpaper majestic freestanding tub and round bed we felt like we had fallen into a fantasy and relished every second of it
