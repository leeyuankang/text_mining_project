the staff were very helpful and solicitous aleksandra was extremely helpful both with the original booking over email from the usa and in person throughout our stay it was very nice to be able to open the windows onto the garden at the back for fresh air we have stayed here a number of times over the last years or so the last time we did the hotel was a little run down since then minor changes to the hotel have greatly improved its appearance the morale attentiveness and knowledge of the staff have improved too its location in notting hill is ideal walking distance from any number of shops restaurants public transport and of course the portobello road
