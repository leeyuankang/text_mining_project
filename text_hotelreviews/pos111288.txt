everything beautiful location lovely hotel with amazing rooms we had room which has a bed so big you need a small ladder to climb in whilst you don t have access to the private gardens which the rooms to the rear overlook they certainly do provide a great view especially if having breakfast in the room the best part though has to be the staff every person we met who worked at the hotel were very friendly polite helpful and genuinely nice people and they were all certainly a big factor in helping to make this trip such a wonderful experience we literally can t wait to go back when planning my trip to london i had various hotels which were on my shortlist like claridge s the savoy etc but have to say that i m so happy to have found this wonderful little hotel as i honestly don t believe we would have had such a great trip without it
