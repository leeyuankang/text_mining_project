the location was the best thing about this hotel plus the staff were very helpful the rooms were clean and modern with excellent air conditioning and they were very quiet our room was facing rue st honore the bathrooms were great with lovely natural bath products the bedrooms were a little small but typical for paris it was just a few minutes walk to tuileries metro and there were always lots of cabs available small and convenient we didn t eat in the hotel there is a carrefour down the road where you can buy provisions bottled water etc as a mother and daughter travelling alone we always felt very safe in this hotel which is important in these troubled times
