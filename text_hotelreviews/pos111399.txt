we stayed in a suite as we were travelling with a year old and wanted an area to sit in the evening once she had gone to bed this worked really well the suite had two bathrooms and was ample space the staff were very helpful and followed us up to our room on several occasions with various items we had left in the restaurant location was superb absolutely brilliant concierge recommended a child friendly restaurant just round the corner for our last evening he booked it for us and let us borrow the hotel s baby chair to take with us it was perfect
