this is by far the best hotel i ve ever stayed in and i have traveled a lot everything was define from the comfy beds to the design to the extremely friendly and professional staff to how comfy it was for the children they absolutely loved it and made us promise to holiday in london again this year just so they could return to this hotel for me the bar was so cozy and nice the spa facilities well on the money i m still sleepy from the relaxing massage and facials i got yesterday lol yes it is expensive to stay but it is a star hotel with great value for money you will feel so good so much that you d forget you coughed out a mini fortune so staying here whenever i m in london
