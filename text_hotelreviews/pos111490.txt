the children loved the impressiveness wow factor of the hotel as you walk into reception they also loved the huge bedroom one of the largest we have ever stayed in and the fact that the room s balcony overlooked the stunning conservatory area they also loved the pool the children used room service from the children s menu and thought the food was absolutely superb it arrived promptly we were pleased that for the first time in our extensive experience visiting hotels the children were provided for eg there were robes pairs of slippers glasses in the bathroom this never happens even in and star hotels the spa area was lovely with complementary newspapers fresh fruit and herb and fruit flavoured water on tap lockers were free and spa robes and slippers were provided we appreciated all these little touches we asked for a quiet room which it certainly was we had no sense of the big busy main road outside the beds were big and comfy and we all had an excellent night s sleep
