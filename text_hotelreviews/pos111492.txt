very comfortable room excellent helpful and courteous staff only ate breakfast at the hotel which was very good with a very wide choice for a large hotel in central london it was very peaceful and relaxing finally the landmark is located in an area of the city with which i am not that familiar with but it is very well placed within easy walking distance of many attractions including lord s cricket ground which was why we were there robert marsh
