we had a fabulous stay at this remarkable hotel as it was a special occasion for us we wanted to stay at somewhere really special and this fitted the bill perfectly the staff were so attentive and courteous our room was spacious and very comfortable and the location opposite marylebone station was perfect we didn t get time to try afternoon tea in the lovely winter garden so hope to do so next time we visit
