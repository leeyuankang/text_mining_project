the landmark is gorgeous including the newly renovated gym and spa facilities and all staff throughout the hotel were extremely attentive i loved the white company products in the hotel room and the complimentary water was a welcome touch as a new guest i also felt very privileged to be invited by the general manager to a cocktail and canap s evening i would highly recommend this hotel especially since it is well situated close to marylebone station and to our london office which will often host overseas travelers like myself
