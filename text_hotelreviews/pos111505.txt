excellent location right in front of marylebone station and a short walk to baker street very convenient to get around marylebone is generally a lovely area our room was big old fashioned in a good way and generally we have no complaints kids loved breakfast buffet in the winter garden they are still talking about it not included with the room rate but certainly handy
