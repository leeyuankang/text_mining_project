a beautiful hotel that feels like it has been unloved of recent palatial but feels it has seen better days the gym and pool were both closed a fact not mentioned when booking i would have chosen another place if i had known the management offered access to a nearby gym pool but it s not the same heading down the elevator in sports clothes or bathrobe is a treat for me leaving to go to an outside gym is different the service in the cafe was slow and without much care some staff unduly snooty the bar was cozy but overly pricey a shot of a good scotch cost gbp a local bar charged gbp i m fine with extra cost for the plushness but that s too much for me
