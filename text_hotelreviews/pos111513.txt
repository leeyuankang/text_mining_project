the landmark is a top quality hotel and the location is great being right next to marylebone main line station and underground it is also close to marylebone high street which if you have not checked it out before do so it has great shops and a great atmosphere we were travelling for a birthday treat and part of our itinerary was sketch in conduit street afternoon tea like you have never had afternoon tea book now and street at the theatre royal drury street fabulous show with great cast fab sets lighting and great orchestra i had visited the landmark when down on business just for a pot of tea on the storm doris day doris day for short when a train home was proving very illusive i liked the look of it and decided that we should pay a bit more for our upcoming visit to london to enhance our experience it was an excellent decision the hotel has an internal central atrium which is a special feature of the hotel the bedrooms surround this atrium and are on floors some rooms overlook the atrium and some have an external aspect breakfast and lunches are served in the atrium and the gazebo on the mezzanine level is a great place for an informal drink light lunch in squishy sofas or seated at tables the staff at the landmark were without exception attentive helpful and always welcoming we were in the standard double room which was spacious well furnished and very clean the marble bathroom was lovely with white company toiletries and lovely big fluffy white towels the shower was fine but the water pressure could have been better for filling the large bath the only slight gripe with the room was the mattress and this is the only reason i did not give a score you could see on entering the room that the mattress was not level and flat always a bad sign it was also thinner that i am used to in good hotels
