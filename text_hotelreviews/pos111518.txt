loved the whole place decor and furnishings were magnificent staff were wonderful our room was really spacious with a fabulous bathroom can t fault anything fantastic breakfast a bit pricey but the opportunity is there to eat as much as you want with an unbelievable choice stayed in a family room with my sister and our two grandsons who were totally in awe of the whole experience wish we could have stayed longer
