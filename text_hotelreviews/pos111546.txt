i ve stayed in most hotels in london over the years i now only choose to stay at the landmark the hotel is beautiful the staff are always wonderful and make you feel comfortable i ve stayed in several hotels where the staff look down there noses at you certainly not the case at the landmark i would describe the service and stay as very similar to a stay on a top quality cruise exceptional
