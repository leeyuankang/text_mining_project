we arrived early at we were aware check in was at but hoped a room would be ready or we could use the pool until it was time to go to our show the lady on reception had options for us a room ready in mins but may have some noise from a wedding later a room ready at or an upgrade that wouldn t be available until we decided on the upgrade as we were going out anyway we said we d take the children for a swim have some lunch then head out then we were told the pool had restricted hours for children sensing our disappointment she rang down and asked if they were busy as they weren t they allowed us to take the children down for a swim which was very accommodating the room was beautiful and even had a play tent we decided on room service for dinner which the children thought was great all in all an amazing experience for us all thank you
