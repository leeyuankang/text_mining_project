located ideally with direct access to marylebone station and a three minute walk from baker street station the landmark epitomises luxury and comfort in the city of london the room was spacious and neat the bedding was comfortable and the staff were for the most part helpful and attentive we had dinner at the hotel scrumptious and drinks at the very cosy mirror bar while the rates are high they aren t out of the ordinary for a five star hotel in london would stay here again and definitely recommend it to others
