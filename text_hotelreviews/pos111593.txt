i have stayed at numerous hotels around the world but my landmark hotel experience is the best i have experienced the staff and service are faultless so courteous prompt to attend to ones requests the hotel itself is so beautiful everywhere you turn there are amazing features and the flower arrangements which are changed weekly are breathtaking i loved the bathroom in my room the tap fittings and only an aussie would mention this but the toilet paper is amazing the whole atmosphere as you walk around is a feeling of goodwill i have just arrived back in sydney this morning and my thought was that i miss my daughter london and the landmark hotel i cannot wait for my return hopefully next year the location is great close to all forms of transport and interesting shops i will recommend the landmark hotel to my friends with confidence thank you for a wonderful stay
