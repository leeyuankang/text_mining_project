we arrived at the hotel well before normal check in time but our room was already ready for us which was a real bonus and made the rest of our day much more relaxed the room itself was spacious quiet comfortable and as is always the case at the landmark beautifully appointed staff were uniformly friendly and courteous the bar is intimate with good ambience and an excellent selection of drinks
