the buffet breakfast was amazing highly recommended but go early close to both edgware road tube station and a pick up drop off bus stop for several london bus tour companies i e golden tours minute walk to marble arc and oxford street for shopping they did offer luggage storage until your room was ready don t expect to get in early spacious room housekeeping was very prompt
