the hotel lobby areas was lovely and well lit and airy and very nice the male receptionists who checked us in was very nice and jovial and spoke to us same applied to the concierge desk personnel the room was ready early which was a bonus but if not they had offered to take our luggage and keep till later having grown up and lived and worked in our family hotel i know it is hard to please us hoteliers as we seem to expect more or we see the faults quicker but this hotel was just great in every aspect so well done the room was fine and adequate for people bathroom a bit samall but very clean and again enough breakfast very efficient for such huge numbers staff were polite and let everyone in to a table without delay
