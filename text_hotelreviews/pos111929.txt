the staff were really friendly couldn t fault them at all the hotel was big with so many guests resulting in a bit of tension queuing for breakfast but overall a very nice stay worth for two nights b b probably not location is good for london my two teenage girls felt very intimidated walking past the endless staring men sitting outside the cafes on the approach to marble arch but once past them all was good
