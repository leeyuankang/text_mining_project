the hotel is great the staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that i will visit the hotel again the room superior double floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops very clean good sleep and i liked it aesthetically it has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel i would definitely recommend it
