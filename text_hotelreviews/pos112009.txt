the staff were amazing especially fernando sanchez reservations supervisor who kindly allowed us to modify our booking even though we selected one with a no cancellation policy on check in we were greeted with a smile and as did every other staff member we met the hotel itself is very clean spacious and had everything we needed for a nights stay
