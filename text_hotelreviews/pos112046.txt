we were treated with cheerful courtesy and kindness on arrival there had been some mix up with our booking surname listed wrong but soon all was resolved we were meeting guests there from usa and we were able to join them for breakfast without extra cost to them or us all desk staff were friendly and helpful the price was fine considering it was london the building site was at an angle to the hotel but the sound proofing was good where in london is there no development altogether a good experience
