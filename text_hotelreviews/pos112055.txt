the hotel staff were very good friendly and polite restaurant food was good although long wait to be seated and waited quite a while before tea and coffee were served on both mornings very very disappointed in the comfort of the beds one bed was not to bad but the other was awful very hard made noise every time you moved i had to take pain killers the next day as my back was so painful and not everybody likes feather pillows would be good idea to put other types in wardrobe also think rooms need a little freshening up looking tired
