staff was very kind they helped us on everything we needed special thanks to ariana and rafael and everyone greets you in the hall breakfast was great but always crowded rooms are big and beds are very comfortable it is very close to edgware station so you can take bakerloo circle and hammersmith city and district lines and there are many restaurants and small markets nearby i definitely recommend
