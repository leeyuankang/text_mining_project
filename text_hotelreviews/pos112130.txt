i visited for a conference and trade show with towards attendees facilities were excellent both for lectures and for the exhibition as a hotel it was more expensive than my usual budget but it is easy to see why the price is justified and i feel i got good value for money staff were always smiling never intrusive but available for the slightest thing the secret of success the food was the high point for me there are several contrasting options i tried edg and fiamma relaxed but efficient service at table good menu choices food was perfectly cooked and well presented special thanks to guiseppe and crew the after dinner cocktails are intriguing and well worth sampling
