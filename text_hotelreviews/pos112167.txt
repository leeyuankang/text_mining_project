this hotel is gorgeous easy check in process nice and helpful staff everywhere in the hotel particularly the restaurants cozy and clean room though my personal highlight was the beautiful view from the sky bar at the top of the hotel a gorgeous view of london that is difficult to find without paying a huge price
