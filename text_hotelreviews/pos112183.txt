we booked this hotel because of the swimming pool upon arrival we were notified that the pool was closed there was no mention of this before arrival we then tried to use the wifi in the room and were notified that there was no free wifi the staff were also pretty rude when we checking in this hotel is very overpriced for the service you receive also do not go to the skybar it s the worst skybar i ve ever been to and extremely expensive
