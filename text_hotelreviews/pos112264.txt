the bathroom wasn t clean there were hairs from either previous guests or house keepers bed also had a few other hairs i think the hotel is dated in many parts and the windows are so old fashioned they could do with being replaced the food we ordered to the room on the first night was cold and it worth the money we paid the breakfast on the sunday morning that we had in the room was very good in the saturday morning there were so many people queuing that we didn t eat in the hotel the girl who was at reception when we checked in was really rude no smiles or politeness and i couldn t understand most of what she was saying to me her english was terrible i kept having to ask her to repeat herself which didn t help with her attitude the room service staff were amazing so friendly and so helpful
