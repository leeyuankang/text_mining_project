my stay was really good from start to finish this is a large hotel but the hilton is well equipped for the mass of people checking they make the process very simple the room was pretty comfortable everything you need from decent tv channels comfortable bed iron for crumpled shirt and a desk to work from i went out in the evening taxis a plenty as you would expect in london breakfast was excellent great service even got asked for my opinion on making things better suggested the add another juice station which was written down not sure if it will ever get implemented i checked out over the phone
