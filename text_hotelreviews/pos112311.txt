the staff were very helpful they did their best to provide us with connecting door rooms as we were a family and it was also an upgrade of what e have previously booked the rooms are spacious the location is great many restaurants and cafes as well as the underground station and the bus stop is just minutes walk the breakfast was also great but it can get crowded during the weekends
