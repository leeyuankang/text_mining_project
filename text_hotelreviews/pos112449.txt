we did appreciate the helpfulness neat appearance and friendliness of the staff the reason for the less than perfect score was that a tin of drink had been taken from the minibar by a staff member who else had access to the room and the charge was added to our invoice with the use of the executive lounge in the same corridor we felt no desire for any more soft drinks our word was accepted at the check out desk
