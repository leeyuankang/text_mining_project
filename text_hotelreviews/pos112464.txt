perfect location you couldn t get any better walk to hyde park oxford street etc paid a little extra for one of the newly refurbished rooms in the tower wing of the hotel really worth the upgrade stayed in the old rooms last year and they are a bit tired but the new suite is really really nice good internet too very clean perfect make sure you visit the windsor castle pub minutes walk away from the hotel for a real british pint of beer lovely staff the real pub experience
