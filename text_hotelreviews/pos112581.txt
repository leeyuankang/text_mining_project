i am an experienced hotel user for both business and holidays i stay in a hotel from my lancashire base at least every other week and can be very critical of staff cleaniness food etc but i am always fair and your hotel cannot be criticised my only gripe was having to lodge upon checking in despite having paid my full tariff before i even arrived i was also asked to do this the last time i stayed at your fine hotel with my wife around last november i was told by your reception girl who checked me in that this was standard procedure at all hilton hotels this of course is not true i stay at many hilton hotels not just in this country but around europe including one in milan last march and have never been asked to lodge before to add insult to injury the isn t returned to my account for about five days later this is a con and an irritating completely unnecessary thing to do otherwise it s for your fine hotel the hilton metropole edgware road marble arch well done to all concerned and thank you for a lovely stay
