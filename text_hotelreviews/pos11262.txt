the service was absolutely exceptional and they were so welcoming and constant attention to your every need was worth a return trip for sure exceptional staff and willing to go overboard to make sure you feel like it is your home away from home they were kind enough to store our luggage for a side trip outside of london that we took prepare flowers for an event we attended and clean an outfit that another restaurant spilled on the bar staff especially jacamo and angelo were not only a delight but truly made our stay with their personalities and care it was nice to return to them after a day of site seeing or event attending always upbeat staff the structure itself and decor was so well done and enjoyed the colors and style very much so english and beautiful nice detail touches the ribbons on the table in the dining room and all the flowers were so well done a romantic and picturesque hotel worth staying at air conditioner was great
