the staff at the milestone is what makes this place great i ve never stayed in a hotel with such friendly and helpful staff the hotel is small boutique yet the facilities are great it was pretty amazing to see how much they could fit into this place the location is also ideal just a short walk to the park across the street and close to shopping restaurants and the underground
