we are a swedish family who were in london for easter holiday we stayed in a double room with queen size beds which were just right for our family with two adults and two children the bathroom was a good size with a bath tub nice products in bathroom too kettle with coffee tea in the room and two good sized closets the hotel is located close to subway and many buses which take you quickly to the city area the staff cleaned the room quickly in the morning which is definitely a big plus since sometimes we came back to the hotel early afternoon the front desk staff was very nice too
