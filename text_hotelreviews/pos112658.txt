this was the first time i actually got to spend some time in london to explore it the hotel was great if just a little out of the way but great underground connections to get to everywhere we wanted to go the staff were extremely helpful full of knowledge which really helped great value for money i booked it early was delighted with the price as i knew we would be up out early back late was on the floor in the west wing beds made everyday
