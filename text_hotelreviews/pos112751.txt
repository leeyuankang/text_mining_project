the view was fantastic looking right over the city being able to see the shard and the ldn eye amoung other things the beds were very comfortable and the shower was good and easy to use the lobby and reception areas were very nice open clean and bright areas and the bars were very comfortable with attentive staff being so close to the is great and also just across from the tube is ideal
