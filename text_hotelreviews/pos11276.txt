the hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in london i was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink the area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable i opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone i met made me feel extremely special i only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time i would certainly stay again yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny
