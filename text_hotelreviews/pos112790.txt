very good location and spacious rooms we were a family of with two children reception staff were very helpful and allocated rooms with connecting doors the tube station was across the street and so were several shops and cafes very convenient to have m s bang opposite the hotel too very good room service too all in all i would definitely recommend the hotel and will stay here again next time i am in london
