the metropol is a huge center hotel and most of the rooms are slightly old and tired in typical hilton uk fashion but some of the floors here have been recently refurbished and we had a nice super modern suite in the tower wing room all modern fresh usb charger sockets in the wall for your phone super nice bathroom with rain shower and stonework extremely comfortable double bed and great linnens good housekeeping over our night stay good air con breakfast was true to the hilton standard but it gets super busy as it s such a big hotel so get there as early as you can before is best all round a good hotel and good place to stay right in the centre walk to oxford street and hyde park etc
