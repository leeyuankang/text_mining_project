de liked the fact that we could do early check in the beds were comfortable it s good to have a mini fridge in the room too the spa was great and good price the massages were too expensive though the rooms had good isolation and the cleaning personnel was very discreet when doing the rooms on our floor also very thick curtains allowing you to sleep in it s close to a nice neighbourhood exmouth market where you can find a nice cafe called briki
