all else was greatthere was a problem in the dining room at dinner on a sunday night there was no decaffeinated coffee and there seemed nothing could be done about it as the machine they used only took one kind of coffee the machine in other area only made large quantities i had invited a friend for dinner i discussed with dr manager and he deducted an amount from our bill but it seemed totally ridiculous clearly the pm had not done the job he she should the breakfast guests on monday would have an issue too
