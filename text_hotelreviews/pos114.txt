this hotel was great value for money only a few tram stops away from the city centre it was close enough for all the attractions of amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood the zoo is literally a minute walk away or one tram stop very accessible the room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep i ve ever had i would highly recommend this hotel
