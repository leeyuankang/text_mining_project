the bedroom was clean comfortable and a good size the bathroom was modern and attractive although water splashed everywhere due to the design of the shower there was an excellent choice of food at breakfast and it was all delicious the location was not ideal but there are buses and taxis going past regularly so it wasn t a real problem
