the location of the property is excellent close to high kensington street underground close to shops restaurants and sights it is a pleasant area the hotel is undergoing some renovations which will bring a contemporary feel to the front desk our room was actually seemed renovated and fresh and i really enjoyed the shower however it is a small room and the bed was quite small for me and my teenage son not a big problem for a few nights but it d be more of a challenge for someone larger or a longer stay breakfast was fine with the regular spread of toast jam boiled eggs yogurt cereals fruit
