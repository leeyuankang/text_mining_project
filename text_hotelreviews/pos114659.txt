we were friendly welcome by staff even though we arrived a bit in advance they were very helpful the room and bathroom were clean and very comfy with respectable size the hotel is located in a calm neighborhood kensington which is easily rapidly accessible by tube circle and district lines so very good connections with london main stations and places to visit ideal for a base to explore london
