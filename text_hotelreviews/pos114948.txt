the hotel is very well placed close to ladbroke grove underground station and a short walk to portobello road which is why i chose it and i was not disappointed it was ideally placed as i was meeting my sister who had come over from toronto and had relatives living close to portobello road clean and comfortable room and bed with a good size en suite and an excellent shower shame about the view but you can t have everything
