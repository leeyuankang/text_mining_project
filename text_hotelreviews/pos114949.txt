i loved portobello house it was beautifully decorated very clean the bar restaurant downstairs were really smart the menu looked delicious the bed was fab breakfast was great with eggs exactly to order the staff could not have been more attentive they were polite professional at all times we were at the front of the hotel on a saturday night there was no discernible noise from inside or out of the hotel it was exactly what i had hoped for a more i would be happy to go back again again
