we stayed at the meurice for nights over a week end as a birthday celebration for my partner and got the most wonderful treatment from the moment we stepped in the lobby we were greeted with great kindness by the front desk and they surprised us with a free room upgrade so lovely the room was wonderfully appointed with a welcoming bag of chocolates by alain ducasse and every possible amenity you could wish for it was decorated in xviii th century style think lovely furniture glamorous chandelier thick draped curtains and even two majestic columns and offered ample space to hang your clothes multiple drawers a very comfortable sitting area and the most luxurious bed which came with a lavender spray to help you get a good night rest our choice of newspapers was waiting for us every morning at the door of our room on saturday afternoon as we were back in our room for a bit of rest the staff surprised us with a birthday chocolate cake which was so very thoughtful and utterly delicious during our stay we visited the bar twice for cocktails in the evening the bar is both impressive with its high painted ceiling and cosy with wood panelling and dimmed lights cocktails are inventive and the staff is ever so attentive a compliment that must be paid to everyone in this hotel really from the footmen to the chambermaids and of course every single person who waited on us at breakfast or tea everyone was genuinely attentive to our needs and general well being the whole staff was extremely kind and we could feel their utmost priority was to ensure we felt at home at all times and had the most wonderful stay ever on both mornings we had breakfast in the sumptuous alain ducasse restaurant which is reminiscent of the ch teau de versailles very grand and full of light
