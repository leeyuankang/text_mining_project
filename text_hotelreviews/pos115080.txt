the room is very clean big bed is very comfy has a nice balcony and amazing big bathroom in terms of room i would rate as one of the best in paris location not my personal favorite it s a minute nice walk to all the fancy shops and nice restaurants breakfast very limited options staff were friendly but not very accommodating asked for restaurant reservations before arrival and they confirmed during check in at the restaurants they didn t find our reservations we arrived at around next morning asked for late checkout they said they needed the room asap but when tried booking online or through booking their were rooms available for a new hotel i would not have done that i would give it another try if the rates stay the same right now it s very much value for money euros night including breakfast but maybe this is because they just opened if they raise the prices i would stay elsewhere
