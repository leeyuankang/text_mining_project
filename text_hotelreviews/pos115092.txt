my wife and i had a wonderful stay located just a minute stroll from the louvre and the nearest metro station and in a safe and secure district of paris the maison albar is an excellent choice for anyone visiting paris who enjoys a bit of luxury as well a being within walking distance of the main sights the hotel itself is beautifully designed and meticulously clean the staff are incredibly friendly helpful and well trained the pool and spa are clean modern and beautifully designed it s not often i would stay in the same hotel twice but with the maison albar i will defiantly be returning in the near future
