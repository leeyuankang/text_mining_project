there was an excellent choice of breakfast we were expecting just a standard continental breakfast but was delighted to see a fabulous breakfast selection very tasty and not greasy lovely our room was clean and cool i couldn t get the air conditioning system to work but it was ok because there was a ceiling fan and a large window which opened and let fresh air in
