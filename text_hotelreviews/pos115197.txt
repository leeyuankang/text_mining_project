the staff were friendly and helpful breakfast room was large and had a very good selection of hot and cold foods the room was very small but by london standards was probably standard and everything was very clean and adequate the indoor pool and sauna was a real bonus and we really enjoyed using those facilities after a long day of sight seeing
