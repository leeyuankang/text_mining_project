friendly staff no issues at all for us on our stay quiet room at front of hotel had a ceiling fan nice quiet which was good as it was hot and we don t like air conditioning my suit got a bit creased in my case while travelling to london so it was great to discover the trouser press had a built in ironing board swimming pool was nice hardly any guests were using it so also nice and quiet
