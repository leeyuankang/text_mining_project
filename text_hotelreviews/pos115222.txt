we liked that the hotel was close to the hop on hop off bus stop we also liked that there were several little pubs eating places small grocery shops nearby the area of the hotel was nice and quiet all lovely properties the staff were friendly helpful however some of the staff were unable to understand english and some conversations were confusing
