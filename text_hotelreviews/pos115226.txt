lovely hotel staff were very friendly and helpful the breakfast choice was excellent and of good quality we especially loved the swimming pool it was like getting into a bath which we had to ourselves the time we spent in it the bus stop which takes you into the central areas of oxford street and piccadilly circus is just a short minute walk away as is kensington gardens we had a great time and would definitely visit henry hotel again
