on arrival i was told that the room wasn t ready ok it had just turned i was also told that i had booked a double room that only measured it might be too small for me i could however if available upgrade into a room that was for an extra per day more i said ok i will do that the person on reception a young spanish man by the name of juan was very heplfull and also very polite we left our baggage there walked around for an hour or so and then came back and checked in to the hotel the room we were given was ample clean and fine for the short stay in london days the quiet location of the hotel is great when you use the bus system and an oyster card to get around as said staff very helpful but be aware of the small rooms i heard many complaints whilst in the lobby from guests saying how small their rooms were but we were happy
