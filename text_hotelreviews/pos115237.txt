the bed was lovely and comfortable and the breakfast was lovely with all the choice i was impressed the swimming pool was good as i like to swim and the sauna was ok but only could fit two people in comfortably i recommend a clean of the edges of the swimming pool on the rules the staff were polite and helpful i enjoyed my stay with you thankyou very much would come again
