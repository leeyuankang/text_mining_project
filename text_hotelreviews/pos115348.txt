i took my old daughter to see aladdin and we stayed here for her birthday she cried when we had to check out she didn t want to leave we enjoyed staying here the service food and facilities was fantastic cannot be faulted the only thing is the hotel could do with a bit of modernisation but this would not stop me from coming back as we had a good time
