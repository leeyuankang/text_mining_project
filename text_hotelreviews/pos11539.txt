the hotel is in major renovations with drilling starting as early as am the bar and rest if you could call them that are a disgrace no carpet on the stairs its cold and absolutely filthy the rooms are a disgrace dirty bathroom floors stained linen on the bed as for the noise you may as well forget about sleeping due to drilling one lift worked for the two days which stopped at every floor regardless of requests hence it took minutes to get to your room you know a hotel with s of rooms with one lift and no access to stairs is beyond frustrating id also think illegal in regards to safety if a fire started you d have no way out and when you mention the problems to front of house they smile and shrug seriously what type of reply is that lastly i ve stayed in most brand hotels in london due to the fact i fly there bi weekly as a rule i book direct if you re going to take a percentage of bookings you should at least offer hotels that function as such will i use you again doubtful will i stay at that the holiday in nope never as it stands that hotel should not be suggesting its full service considering its a a work site pretending to be a full service hotel regards kieran
