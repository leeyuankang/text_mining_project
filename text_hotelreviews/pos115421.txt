well this hotel is supposed to be star so that s why i booked it it s never seen a star star at a push it s very dated and the didn t have ac so the room was like s sauna there was no end of people complaining about this the rooms are very small also i new it wasn t going to be great because of the price but it states stars i think this needs looking at asap
