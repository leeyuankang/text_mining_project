i ve stayed here quite a number of times the hotel is presently in an upgrade process so there is some disruption at present despite this the staff are helpful and attentive as usual the place is spotless you would hardly know the builders are in and the new rooms are very nice i am sure the long term result will be great the bed was very comfortable and the room well lit not dark and dull like so many places with mood lighting bad mood the hotel is in a relatively quiet site and there is little internal noise but it is about mins walk to any underground station
