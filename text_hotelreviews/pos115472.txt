the breakfast was great there was a choice for everyone food was tasty and fruit nice and fresh only the apples had wax onthem wich is pretty unhealthy the room was just average could be modernised abit more the bathroom was great and spacious not deficult to use and the water pressure amazing the swimming pool was nice and warm and quiet at the time i went there plus they close it really late so you can have a nice swim before sleeping
