the staff were extremely helpful they agreed to let us check in really early and at no extra cost the room was really clean and comfortable i especially liked the swimming pool too and breakfast was delicious i saw a few negative reviews and was a bit worried but found none to be true in our case location wise it was perfect for us as it was situated in a quiet area very close to the bayswater station which helped us get to heathrow airport easily i wouldn t hesitate to stay here next time
