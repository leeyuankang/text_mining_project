me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night in january for shopping in london location was good if you want a cheap stay and value for money we had to walk around from the hotel to the underground that takes you to oxford circus and such be careful if anyone outside any underground stations offers to take you to the hotel or show you the direction to anywhere this happened to myself and my boyfriend outside the underground on queensway and once we realised the man was trying to take us in the complete opposite direction to where google maps was showing us and refused to go with him he ran away overall though such a lovely stay lovely breakfast lovely swimming pool we had it all to ourselves very helpful and lovely staff definitely reccomemed for a posh but affordable getaway
