the room was clean modern and nicely decorated and truly spacious for london standards towels changed daily good bed and comfy bedding two different pillows to choose between there was even one c e f type socket as used in the rest of europe in the room the location of the hotel is also pretty good although the nearest underground station king s cross is km away
