everything was perfect from the moment ahmed checked us in to the moment we left it was a straightforward walk to the hotel from russell square underground once you ve figured it out hotel are more than happy to help navigate if you need it though check in was fast and easy and so was check out the rooms were clean and well furnished exactly as the pictures showed ahmed said breakfast would include veggie options and i was not disappointed given a hotel in another city recently told me when i stayed that the veggie option was the normal breakfast with the meat products taken out i was sceptical about what it would include this place got it spot on not only were veggie sausages available they were kept away from the meat products along with the beans and mushrooms etc to avoid people using the same handle across both veggie and meat options i m not a vegetarian who moans about these things but it is nice to see a hotel put this much thought in and appreciate how problematic this can be also noticed they had halal chicken sausages for those who wanted them so clearly thought through again eggs made to order to your preference along with an excellent selection of pastries juices cereals and breads for toast all the staff were beyond friendly and helpful and the buildings were so beautiful and the service throughout so good we didn t even mind walking across the square to the goodenough college for breakfast in fact we loved it would definitely stay again as it s worth what you pay and the area is decent and safe from our experience i wil always look here first before considering anywhere else from now on
