since i was on a business trip and had to commute to kings cross daily the location of the hotel was perfect for me took me minutes walk the hotel itself was located across the street from a private park and on a quiet street my room was clean cleaned every day and the bathroom was freshly renovated with a great shower bed was very comfortable the staff is nice and helpful
