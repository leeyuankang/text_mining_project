location is superb direct line from heathrow piccadilly line to russell square minutes walk to hotel and you can walk everywhere from there covent garden leicester square etc we found a nice note and a box of chocolate in our room hotel noticed that we had an anniversary and this was really nice surprise bathroom was laconic but nice and clean overhead shower though makes it a bit more complicated to have shower without washing your hair there is access to private garden just across the club that looks really nice possibility to make tea and coffee in the room is really a bonus
