such an easy location if you are coming from the eurostar although the neighborhood is very quiet and so walking there at night is strange but harmless in the end i thorughly enjoyed two museums a few yards away the charles dickens museum the foundling museum they both have tea rooms i had a delicious banana caramel cake slice at dickens they had savory food that looked amazing also quiche and or gluten free sandwich i was thrilled by my stroll inside the private garden by borrowing the key from the frontdesk crocuses and daffodils just starting to bllom february at night i partied at the pianoworks only minute walk away wonderful atmosphere great live music audience suggestion for songs non stop dancing and delicious cocktail especially the mandarine lychee cosmopolitan food was quite nice also
