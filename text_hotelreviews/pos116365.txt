a really exceptionally renovated grand old property it was our first visit and were upgraded to a suite as a special welcome so nice breakfast in the great hall of the college next door is a treat lovely quite neighborhood but walkable to our favorite the national theatre gracious friendly front desk staff added to the enjoyment
