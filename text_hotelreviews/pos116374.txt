the setting in historic college buildings and having breakfast in the great hall with oak panel walls flooring and oil paintings is stunning staff were extremely friendly the breakfast was very good indeed the room was very comfortable with very modern bathroom and excellent hot shower and the location is really quiet at night and max minutes walk to st pancras railway station really enjoyed my stay
