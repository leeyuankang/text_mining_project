beautiful peaceful setting in a typical london regency square the hotel is in a set of regency town houses each with a separate front door the rooms are beautiful and i had a lovely room overlooking the square if you have mobility problems make sure you let the hotel know when booking as there are no lifts but don t worry about carrying your baggage the staff on reception couldn t be more helpful there is a choice of breakfast location either full english across the road where you can also dine or a lovely continental breakfast in the basement of the main building the pastries are superb great stay
