the rooms were lovely spacious the beds were very comfortable and the shower was pretty awesome also the hotel is set in a fantastic location very close to st pancras good bars clubs and restaurants and walkable to most of the main attractions in central london the breakfast was fantastic and that goes for both carnivores like myself and my vegetarian gf also breakfast was in a beautiful and quirky hall which looked like it was straight out of the harry potter films breakfast was also served till noon on sundays a nice touch especially if you are hungover from the night before had a truly wonderful stay here
