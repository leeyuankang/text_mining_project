i was really pleased with this booking the room was spacious well equipped and very comfortable the staff were welcoming and the small details like the lounge with complimentary tea and coffee added to the homely feel i had no previous awareness of the hotel and chose it for location i was delighted to discover the buildings the hotel occupies adjoining town houses had such character and that the square was so quiet i e almost no traffic this isn t your typical london hotel instead it offers a much more interesting option at very good value particularly with the included breakfast we only stayed one night but i suggest it would be a great base for a long stay
