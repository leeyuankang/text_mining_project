from the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and considerate our room was fabulous the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely the breakfast buffet was super and the style of the bar area and reception was super it was only a shame we did t get to enjoy that area close by is the bouillon chartier restaurant which a a fabulous dining experience not the best food in the world but incredible value for money in a fantastic setting
