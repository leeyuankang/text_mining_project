when the taxi pulled into our street it did look a tad dodgy but don t let that make you think anything is dodgy about the hotel there s a metro station only about a minute walk away hotel throughout was clean and well kept bedroom spotless staff more than helpful each time we asked them to suggest good restaurants great selection at breakfast and food constantly topped up loved the free glass of wine on the night we arrived
