i stayed at vignon in and decided to book it again during my recent visit to paris what a great choice the hotel s location is perfect for walking to the main attractions the top floor room was freshly decorated with lots of natural daylight and immaculately clean we tried their breakfast on the last morning and it was perfectly adequate
