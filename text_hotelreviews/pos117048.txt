the place was literally in front of the stepney green underground station so it was really easy to go anywhere there are restaurants bars some fast food places and even a supermarket so you can buy almost anything you need right there communication with the staff was great even when there is no physical receiption they are always available to answer your emails or phone calls which is really great our flight got really delayed and they were always helpful
