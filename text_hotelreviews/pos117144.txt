overall excellent service and very friendly staff good buffet breakfast for pp for those not willing to spend pp they offer a continental breakfast for nice room concept if you consider the total size of the room of approx bed could be a tick longer for taller people not sure about the size but felt like brasserie le petit broc on the bld raspail in for dinner recommended by the night auditor of the hotel was really nice at affordable rates and good quality cuisine will certainly reconsider the hotel on a next stay in paris
