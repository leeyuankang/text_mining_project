this hotel was highly rated by others but we were still stunned by the luxurious accommodations truly beautiful rooms immaculately clean nicely decorated firm beds we had a suite with two rooms one with a king bed and one with a sofa bed walkout balcony in each room location was great very quiet we did not hear any other guests free breakfast for your kids overall very good value for the money
