our one bedroom suite was designed extremely well for privacy we were traveling with our adult son and it made all the difference the hotel is in a beautiful old building and the rooms have been recently renovated in a subtle modern style that complements the original era of the building quite nicely the garage was right downstairs the neighborhood is fabulous full of great eateries and only a minute walk from the montparnasse train station
