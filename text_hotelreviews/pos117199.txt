we recently spent four nights at the aiglon hotel in the montparnasse area of paris the hotel is conveniently located one half block from the raspail metro station and connects to some of the most interesting sights in paris we noticed in several views the remark that the rooms were small and that is true but this is paris and par for the course the bathrooms and shower were first rate however and the room very clean the staff was just wonderful and i especially am grateful to the receptionist who counseled me to just go to a concert i had bought tickets for but had gotten confused and missed the proper date we took that advice and all went well and we had an unforgettable evening there breakfast was excellent with a wide selection and attentive staff i would certainly recommend this hotel
