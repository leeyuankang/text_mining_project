the staff were very friendly and helpful especially camile whom we dealt with most of the time our room was very comfortable and we had lots of room in the family suite the hotel location was fantastic with the metro across the street and lots of restaurants etc on the area i loved looking out the window onto a very parisian street with trees location was also pretty quiet
