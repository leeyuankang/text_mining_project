the place is really nice and offers lots of amenities the gym is a nice feature i thought and the rooms are quite big the panel with which you can control all room funtions is a nice feature the breakfast is really good too and in the evenings the restaurant where breakfast is served turns into a great restaurant tozi that serves tapas all in all i would say that it s a great place for business travellers and those who are on a short stay in london and want everyting close by
