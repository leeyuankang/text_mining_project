great staff and quiet and comfortable accommodations in close proximity to victoria train station we arrived very early in the morning and were able to leave our luggage in reception so that we could make the most of our day similarly left our bags at the hotel after checkout as we had an evening flight and still had a few things to pick up before departing lovely cool piano bar reception area to relax in and have a pre theatre drink before seeing wicked a few doors up the street very good selection and quality of food on offer for breakfast all in all great hotel well positioned and serviced would definitely return
