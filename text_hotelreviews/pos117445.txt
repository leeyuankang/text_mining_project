the hotel was centrally located to our activities and transportation was easy for the bus as well as the tube the room was much larger than i ve experienced with other hotels in the london area it was great the bed was like a cloud it was much more comfortable than i expected the room was quiet during the week but got a little noisy on the weekend as families arrived it would be great if they offered a no children floor the breakfast was the standard english breakfast which i had looked forward too the dining room was spacious and relatively quite in the early morning during the week staff kept our teapots full and served us with a smile the dining room staff were swift to relocate me to another table when the adults at the adjacent table refused to control their shouting children on friday morning later when those same children were running and screaming through the lobby creating a hazard for themselves and others staff quickly asked the parents to control the children i didn t see those unruly children for the rest of the weekend which was a blessing i really appreciated the staff s willingness to address the issue
