our first time travelling with our baby so we booked a larger room due to a computer problem reception were not immediately able to find our booking but came back after minutes and gave us an upgrade to an apartment due to the inconvenience stayed at this hotel a few times location is simply fantastic minutes from victoria so getting around is simple
