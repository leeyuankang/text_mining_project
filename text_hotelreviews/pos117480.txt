first and foremost is the location if you are from gatwick airport and going to central london then look ffor this hotel it is less than minutes walk from victoria station really very handy the staffs were courteous the room size is good enough for two people not recommended for family or maybe they have a family room which is different size from our room since we re only cleanliness wise well the one assigned to us is not really clean especially the bathroom the sink is clogged value for money is a way expensive for a night well london is expensive
