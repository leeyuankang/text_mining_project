we arrived very late at night on the train via victoria station it was a simple minute walk with our rolly suitcases and we were greeted by the wonderful staff we booked rooms next to each other and they were on the floor they were quiet very comfortable and clean no noticeable road noise and the location is truly a plus we specifically chose this hotel for its proximity to the victoria station train and underground we wanted the convenience of hopping onto the tube and the convenience of boarding a train to gatwick airport and we got both many of the sites are within walking distance buckingham palace big ben london eye and others are only a short ride on the underground tower of london v a museum london bridge there are restaurants close by and victoria station has a starbucks and many other eateries inside
