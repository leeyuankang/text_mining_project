i was slightly apprehensive to come to this place due to some reviews as i always read reviews before i go somewhere due to excitement and curiosity anyway the staff at the front where very friendly and so was every other staff member that i came into contact with the room was beautiful i had asked for a smoking room as my other half smokes but when i went into the room it turned out it was non smoking so i called reception to point out this error they then told me i had been upgraded to an executive room which was fantastic to find out who can complain at being upgraded for free not me that s for sure lol overall me and my boyfriend enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this place
