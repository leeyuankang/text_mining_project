the location of this hotel was absolutely excellent we arrived by car and found the drive through to the hotel easier than expected especially for london and the secure underground parking was a huge bonus to us victoria underground station is a very small walk away and then from there almost everything else we wanted was only about stops from the station the staff were friendly and helpful when we needed it and quickly booked us a taxi when we asked any problems we found during our stay were rapidly sorted and we thank them for that the rooms themselves were lovely ours had controls by the bed to open and close curtains change lighting and temperatures which was brilliant the bed was also incredibly comfy and we found it hard to leave it in the morning the bathroom and room in general were both clean and fresh a lovely stay for us in the park plaza victoria and we will definitely be coming back
