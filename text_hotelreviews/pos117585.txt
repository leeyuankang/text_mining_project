our superior twin room was by far the most comfortable in which i ve ever stayed the room was quite large by london standards and was hi tech with all lighting and draperies easily controlled from touch panels at various points in the room the bath was also spacious and very well appointed the room service meals were also some of the best that i ve had anywhere
