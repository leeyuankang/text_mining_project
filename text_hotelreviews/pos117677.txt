we stayed one night and on arrival were upgraded to an apartment which was a nice touch and very much appreciated we went to the tozi italian restaurant downstairs and the food was excellent they do an italian version of tapas style and you order multiple smaller portions we had small dishes between both of us and i really enjoyed the experience as i never had eaten this style before room was air conditioned and this worked well breakfast was in the tozi restaurant area and all food was freshly prepared freshly squeezed orange juice was a nice touch add to all of this the convenience of being very close to victoria tube station and we will definitely stay here the next time we are in london
