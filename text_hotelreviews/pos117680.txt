we stayed at park plaza victoria for four nights the hotel is very conveniently located literally next to victoria train station and is within walking distance to various sights and attractions it seems like the hotel has been renovated recently which was nice however upon checking in we were given a room that stank of cigarettes despite our specific request to have a non smoking room on a non smoking floor and had some other weird damp smells we immediately notified the front desk who immediately apologised and offered to move us to a new room we were then upgraded to the executive suite which was a very pleasant surprise the room was large and comfortable the mattress was just right for my back there were plenty of options on tv we also loved all the cool control panels for the curtains and lighting
