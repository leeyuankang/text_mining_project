the location of the property was excellent just across the street from the victoria tube and bus stations so travel throughout london was convenient it was also near many great quick and sit down dining spots and a pastry shop there was also a grocery store was right around the corner the beds were comfortable and the room was laid out well there was plenty of storage and a safe the room also had washcloths which i have found to be rarity in europe the employee at the club carlson desk came up to setup an extra bed which i really appreciated because it was almost midnight when we arrived
