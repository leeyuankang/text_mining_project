great location walked about blocks if that from victoria train station straight to the hotel with my luggage and not a problem at all across the street and all around are great coffee places and restaurants room service was good food good as well rooms are nice just your basic mid range hotel but clean and comfortable lights curtains air temp etc all controlled by one panel which was convenient i would stay here again
