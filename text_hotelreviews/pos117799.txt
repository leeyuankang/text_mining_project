great size room excellent location minutes walk from victoria station bath robes and complimentary water met the expectations of a star hotel the hotel restaurant is very good indeed the room was clean enough but not exactly sparkling no complaints but a bit of sparkling tiles would add a luxurious touch cheaply the teenager found the ice cube machines and remote controls very entertaining we played curtain wars with the remotes d definitely worth the price i will consider staying there when we visit london next time
