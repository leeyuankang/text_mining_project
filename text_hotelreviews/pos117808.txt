the staff was excellent danny went over the top in helping us plan our road trip through the uk my sister i were really impressed with the breadth of his knowledge his generosity in sharing his experience and his gifting of touring books we were in town for the chelsea flower show which was wonderful but our park plaza experience thanks to danny was endearing the accommodations are very comfortable very clean very quiet and terrifically located we felt very welcomed and very relaxed but what really differentiates this hotel from many others is the staff such as danny and each of his colleagues with whom we interacted
