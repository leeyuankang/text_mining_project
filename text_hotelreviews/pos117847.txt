we enjoyed the excellent service and selection they had at breakfast even though we thought it was a bit pricy when we payed it the hotel is very central and close to london victoria station the interior was new and fresh the staff at the reception was really helpful to make sure we got a good price on the cabfare to gatwick since the gatwick express was closed for reconstruction
