we loved every bit of our stay we payed a lot less than expected and the room we got was beautiful very modern will definitely be staying here again the food was amazing the rooms had buttons on the bedside table which allowed you to turn the lights off and on and close the curtains and control the air con also the bar in the hotel is very spacious and the cocktails are made to perfection
