the sauna and fitness room were spacious and clean one day the sauna wasn t heated as predicted but every other day it was great the location is perfect near to many buses victoria station and even walkable to westminster if you don t have any mobility issues the beds were comfortable and the executive king suite and later the bedroom apartment were very nice especially the view from the bedroom apartment there are two groceries and many restaurants nearby as well the theater where wicked is playing is just down the street
