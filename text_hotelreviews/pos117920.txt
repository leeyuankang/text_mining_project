very friendly staff answered all questions proximity of victoria train station and bus station just yds away concierge on duty hours a day offered great advise on things to do very quiet rooms and comfortable bed breakfast was also very good but exactly the same menu everyday breakfast was also a bit pricey but may be typical for the area
