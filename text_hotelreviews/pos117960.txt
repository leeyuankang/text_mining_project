everything about the hotel we wish we had stayed another night as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay the hotel staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us especially andrew the beds were really comfy and the room was a good size and nice and quiet just like we requested also a good breakfast selection would definitely like to stay there again
