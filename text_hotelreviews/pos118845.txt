only used the hotel as a base so not able to comment on the overall facilities the room was clean and the bed was comfy it was described as a superior double deluxe it wasn t a particularly large room but perhaps that s what you get for a good location in london the staff we met were all pleasant and helpful plenty of places to eat nearby so once again didn t use the hotel services near the british museum which is a fantastic place to visit
