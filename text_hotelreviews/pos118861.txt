overwhelmingly happy with our recent stay at the grange beauchamp hotel i brought my mum to london as a gift for her birthday on arrival we received a very warm welcome and were happy to find our room was ready much earlier than we anticipated it to be also they were kind enough to upgrade us a larger suite which was a lovely surprise the location was ideal and perfect for a theatre stay with it being walking distance to covent garden after an evening out we returned to the hotel to find a fully staffed bar and we enjoyed drinks on our return the room was spotless and well facilitated could not fault this hotel and would definitely love to return
