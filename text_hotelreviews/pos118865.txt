the staff were so welcoming the hotel so clean the location excellent mins stroll to covent garden yet very tranquil as situated on virtually unused road the room was fabulous huge and a very comfortable bed there was a nice small garden patio area outside the rear of the hotel i wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel and to return on my next visit to a london theatre
