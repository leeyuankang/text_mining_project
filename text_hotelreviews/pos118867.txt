very centrally located on a quiet street so even a room in the front is not a problem with noise i was at first given a room in the basement level which was slightly depressing and reeked of lemon disinfectant but was moved for my second night upstairs to the third floor without any problem once there i got a chance to fully enjoy my stay great towels ample supply of pillows
