the staff were lovely although we didn t spend a great time in the hotel itself as we were busy out in london the time we did was really enjoyable after a long train journey to london and a hectic first experience on the tube i really wanted half an hour to freshen up and chill out before exploring london the hotel managed to give us our room hours earlier than check in which was a god send also after leaving the hotel at one day and not returing till harry potter and the cursed child parts and in the same day the turn down service from the hotel was lovely and the little touches made it
