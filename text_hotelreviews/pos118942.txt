the bed was lovely comfortable and huge turn down service was thoughtful with a chocolate each o soft white towels in bathroom and a dressing gown in the wardrobe were nice touches free upgrade to junior suite was a big plus on checking in thank you excellent english breakfast to choose from and hot food served by waiter to table much preferred to hot buffet serve yourself
