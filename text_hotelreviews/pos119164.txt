they went over and above to make the weekend special for example they left birthday messages and a complimentary little cake for my husband as it was his birthday they also upgraded up for free to a junior suite the bathroom was amazing it had shower heads that work independently to allow a couple to show together yet apart no arguing over the temperature it had a glass door which turned it into a kind of steam room which was fab they had a good knowledge of the local areas included nice local pubs the location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area with really close transport links into different areas of london it was really quiet despite being just one road back from the main strip so we were really pleased with the privacy a great stay from start to finish
