the front desk staff were most helpful and friendly and the manager on duty went out of her way to enable us to re print tickets for a particular attraction which we had left behind thank you very much again the location was absolutely fantastic for the things we wanted to do and is very easy to reach by public transport just be aware that the travel options are a bit more limited on sundays the free chilled water available to bottle and take away with you on the floors is a nice touch as is the tea coffee station in the lobby and what s not to like about looking out at the lit dome of st paul s from your bedroom window at night
