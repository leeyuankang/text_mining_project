brilliant location right by st paul s lots of restaurants nearby good customer service hotel provides everything you could need including a launderette double glazing is excellent couldn t hear the tour buses right outside our window at all and the city of london is lovely at the weekend deserted and packed with an amazing jumble of architecture
