this was an ideal base for a night stay in london i tend to walk everywhere when i m in the capital as i find that i always notice something i ve never seen before and found that the hotel was a short walk from liverpool street station there were many other amenities that could be reached on foot the room was small but still felt well designed and comfortable there was plenty of storage and a very comfortable bed staff were friendly and efficient at one point my room key stopped working and it was replaced instantly and with an apology the ground floor lounge with free drinks is a nice touch i will quite happily stay in this hotel again and at others in the chain
