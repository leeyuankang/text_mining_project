the location was excellent with plenty of bars restaurants coffee shops and convenience food stores nearby it was also very handy for the underground and regular buses to take us to different parts of london the staff were very friendly professional and helpful the room was spotlessly clean and i was very impressed with the facilities particularly the number of plugs available and the charging points i would definitely recommend this hotel and will return when i m next visiting london
