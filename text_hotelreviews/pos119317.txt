great location just a few steps from st pauls cathedral tube nearby too however we walked into central london along the embankment this is a nice walk on a sunny day with a few small parks that run parallel to the embankment our bedroom had a walk in shower seperate loo standard size double bed and fine for our overnight stay thank you
