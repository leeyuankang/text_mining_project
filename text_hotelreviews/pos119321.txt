compared to other london prices this was a bargain given the fabulous location right near st paul s cathedral underground also close by staff very friendly on check in and provided great advice on where to eat room small but perfect for our short stay bathroom clean filtered water available for free on each floor found this really great bottles provided staff were more than happy to hold our bags on check out as we didn t leave till late afternoon
