reception staff were great very friendly hotel clean and bed comfortable liked the free use of coffee machine in lounge area and water machines and bottles provided on each floor well stocked service room cupboard where you could help yourself to more coffee tea milks etc anything you might need for room including washing machine and dryer you could use if required
