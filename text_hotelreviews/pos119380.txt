location is fabulous on arrival the hotel appears a little odd it has a cruise ship style feel in the corridors it s comfortable though and clean the addition of the guest locker room is great the shower didn t look great and the bathroom is very minimal on using the shower it was actually pretty good very powerful plenty of room and hot very comfy bed
