we stayed at room which accommodates three guests and has a small kitchenette the room design was extremely efficient for the area it was perfectly arranged to separate the main sleeping area from the seating area and it has a fully equipped kitchenette the room temperature was very comfortable around degree celsius without turning on the heater at all it was very well insulated the beds are extremely comfortable the hotel location is also fantastic very close to st paul station which is on the central line that goes to oxford and hyde park st paul cathedral is fantastic it is seen as you go outside from the hotel entrance there are at least supermarkets at a walking distance and many cafes and restaurants just across the street the hotel also provides free coffee on the ground floor which is nice
