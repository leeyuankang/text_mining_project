location was fantastic easy to get around loads of bus and train options st paul s cathedral right on your doorstep how beautiful we were travelling for a while so having the option of free washing and drying was fantastic free coffee in the members lounge plus an apple or muesli bar staff were lovely and accommodating for us travelling off peak overall it was value for money however i would balk at paying full price
