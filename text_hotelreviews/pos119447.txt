the location of this hotel is ideal five mins walk from the st pauls tube station and then less than to the blackfriars tube which means you have two main tube lines at your door st pauls cathedral is right beside the hotel and the tate gallery is just across the bridge there are also a few good museums within walking distance of the hotel
