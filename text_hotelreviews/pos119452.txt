the room is bigger than i thought it would be absolutely love the big table provided in the room my partner and i are able to do our work side by side without affecting each other the location is perfect as there are many restaurants around the hotel although we could hear st paul s bell ringing once in a while but our room was at the other side of st paul s so it wasn t too big of a factor
