the location of the club quarters hotel st paul s was perfect it was so easy to get to everything much of what we wanted to see and do was in walking distance from the hotel we also loved the free extras like wifi in the room bottled water available right near the elevators on the floors and soda coffee and snacks in the lobby area the staff was also both friendly and helpful
