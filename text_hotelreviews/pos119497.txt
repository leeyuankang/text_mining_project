the location is brilliant right outside st pauls cathedral so wonderful to wake up and walk out to bus stops outside so easy to get into trafalgar square if needs be and then to make the most of your time there we had an issue with the toilets on the second night but admittedly they were low on pressure and struggled to flush when we arrived the staff gave us access to a room two doors down to use and at just gone midnight it was the best solution they could give so fantastic service they also were very apologetic about the issue and offered us a free night s stay within the year can t argue with that definite stay again
