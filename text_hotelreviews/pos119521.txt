thank you for sending me a comments email i have just arrived back to scotland yesterday and have been meaning to write to you and booking com regarding my stay with you on the of august when i initially booked this room i had searched on the booking com website for hotels with parking and yours was one of many that came up now as i had a lot of baggage i was expecting onsite parking so i can check in immediately when i arrived outside the hotel i called to ask reception where i was to park the car as i thought it was to the rear of the building i was directed to a private car park miles away from the hotel the hotel wasn t even aware of the postcode for navigation regardless i went parked and had the sluggish walk back to the hotel at reception i met with an abrupt member of staff was checked in within seconds and almost thrown a card at me for my room the hotel room was dated didn t feel clean and worst of all had a damp towel in the bathroom its was extremely warm there was no fridge and no iron press i travel a lot through my work and i must say this was by far the worst experience ever i look forward to your early response
