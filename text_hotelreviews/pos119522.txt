as with other reviews this hotel is in the perfect location for getting around london the staff are very courteous and the rooms are spotlessly clean comfortable and the perfect size for a couple an added bonus of seeing st pauls cathedral from our window was awesome we didn t experience any noise problems and had no difficulty getting off to sleep we will make this our hotel of choice whenever we visit london again
