staff were excellent in ensuring we had what we needed for an overnight stay when visiting the sights this place is perfect it isn t the place to go if you are after luxury but we have stayed here twice and it was brilliant i made a mistake with one booking and even entered the wrong ate but the manager kindly sorted it out and ensured i had a room superb and discrete service
