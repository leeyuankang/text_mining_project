the room was only a club room but was still substantially bigger than others i ve stayed in in central london i booked the trip for my husband s birthday i told the hotel this and they arrived at the door with a basket full of snacks and a bottle of wine for him service was great and the water filter and plastic bottles to help ourselves to were a wonderful touch
