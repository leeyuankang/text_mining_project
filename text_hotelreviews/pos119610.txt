the staff at the reception was extremely helpful the hotel is very well located and easy for visiting london for a weekend there a few bars close to the hotel which could be an alternative if you don t select breakfast with your room we even had an issue with the pre arranged taxi drop off to the airport with the hotel but the hotel staff was extremely helpful in settling this with the taxi company after our stay and helped us to get a refund of the excess amount charged by the taxi company
