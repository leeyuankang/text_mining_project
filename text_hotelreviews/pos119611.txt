hour early check in filtered water and ice machine room said small queen but it was fine wasn t small great location within four or five minute walk to st paul s underground station i will be staying here again as it is reasonably priced and good air con too plenty of eateries with a coupe of hundred yards and st paul s cathedral is worth a visit too i think that sunday maybe the best day to do this as there feet climb you can do to get stunning views of london
