it s our third visit to this hotel and we will no doubt be back the reception staff are extremely helpful and even allowed us to check in even though we arrived earlier than the specified check in time the rooms are comfortable with little extras such as london guide books the locality can be quiet at night but it is only a minute walk into the west end or a few stops on the tube
