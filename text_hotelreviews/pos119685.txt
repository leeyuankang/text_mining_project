i got there a bit early before noon but was able to check in without any problem the standard room was great not too small as can sometimes be the case with london hotels the area was great the staff was friendly bathroom was clean there s even an option to go to dinner at the french restaurant next door and have your meal added to your hotel bill all in all a good experience
