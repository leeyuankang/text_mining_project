staff were friendly and it was all extremely clean everywhere paid cheaper than a local travelodge for this so was very impressed location was amazing with views of st paul s as well as being close to food and convinience shops like co op sainsburys and m s right next door as well as bars and restaurants or if not the tube is a second walk
