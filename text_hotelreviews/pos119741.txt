we loved the location on ludgate hill right next to st paul s which we planned to visit and a short walk from the thames there were many places to eat nearby and great shopping at one new change our room was small but comfortable great shower bed tv all the essentials for a pleasant stay the lounge area with complimentary refreshments was particularly appreciated as was the chilled purified water on each floor i wish all hotels offered this it certainly made up for the lack of mini bar in our room overall i would definitely recommend this hotel and will almost certainly book again
