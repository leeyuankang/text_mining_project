we stayed at the hotel from the of august and enjoyed our stay and the staff were great when we checked out we left a bag behind in the room and only realised we didn t have it when we got to the airport and all the kids presents and our families gifts were in it and one of the night staff called akmid not sure of the spelling called a taxi and sent our bag to the airport so the kids wouldn t go without their presents and he also put pounds of his own money to pay towards the taxi fare as we didn t have enough so a huge thank you to him and the kids were very happy with their presents
