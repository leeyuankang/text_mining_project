we paid for an upgrade to our room and liked it very much the bed was comfortable the room well appointed and most of all it was lovely and quiet the hotel was fine though we did little in it except sleep and have breakfast the latter was fine the location of the hotel is convenient for fleet st and neighbouring areas
