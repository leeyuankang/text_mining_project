hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all we were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely loved the apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website
