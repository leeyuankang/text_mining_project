location extremely close to st lazare very central station right next to the terminal station of the cdg bus opera actually right on the route of the bus i asked the driver to open the door right out of the hotel comfort no negative comments although a paris hotel water bottles are for free and unlimited very small gesture but wow staff very friendly wifi breakfast very complete and good despite a paris hotel usually the breakfasts are mediocre sound insulation despite on a very busy street absolute silence in the floor room
