the room is beautiful and a decent size for paris we found the bed and pillows very comfortable compared to other hotels of the same price there is a cool additional light fixture in the shower that changes colors at different speeds in general the lighting in the room is very good we liked the outlets on both sides of the bed for cell phone charging everything in the hotel looks brand new we felt safe in the location just across from the saint lazare train station it was well placed a short walk to the nightlife of place de clichy and would be a short walk in the other direction to opera
