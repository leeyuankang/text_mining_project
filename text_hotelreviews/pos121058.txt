the hotel was clean the staff were friendly and helpful the quality of the fixtures was high particularly the shower it was in a central location we were able to leave our case there after checkout on the day of departure without charge we were invited to sit in the hotel and have a coffee whilst waiting for our early evening train we would definately recommend this hotel
