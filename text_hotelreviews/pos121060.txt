the hotel is located some meters from the st lazare station which may be an advantage for those using public transportation the area is rather quiet despite the vicinity of the station the hotel is super suprisingly clean all the facilities are working and it seems it has been freshly renovated the rooms are rather quiet even the ones facing the amsterdam street the staff are friendly there is no restaurant at the hotel but there are plenty of dining options in the city and in the area for those having late evening thirst there is a night shop across the street
