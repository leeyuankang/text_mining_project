we really enjoyed our stay at h tel beauchamps the room was quite spacious and each day it was cleaned no matter what time we vacated the room i will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family who go to paris the underground was close to the hotel and tourist attractions were within walking distance the wifi was excellent the rooom we were in was quiet which made for a relaxing stay highly recommend this hotel and it was good value for money in my opinion
