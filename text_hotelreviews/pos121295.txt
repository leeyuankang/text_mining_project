bed was comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious a c was cold breakfast was good and had excellent cappuccino employees were friendly helpful and professional i made several changes to our reservation before we arrived and hotel staff always responded quickly and were very accommodating the location was excellent we were visiting to see the end of the tour de france this hotel was short blocks from champs de ellysees and a short walk to the arc de triomphe great location which is always a priority when traveling and surprisingly well priced restaurants cafes and shopping were very convenient we took private cars arranged by hotel taxis and subway and this central location made things easy a tiny but appreciated bonus was that the room had sets of french doors along one wall which opened to about a wide balcony did not sit outside but definitely stood and watched would book this hotel for future visits
