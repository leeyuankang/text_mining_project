the bed is amazing room is cosy location is great very near to champ elysees very friendly and helpful staffs in the hotel check in check out was quick and easy great hospitality clean modern room the black room is much bigger and better than the red room it is both a standard room although we stayed next to the street couldn t hear anything from outside the hotel was under renovation when we stayed there and we were quite worried it will be too noisy during our stay but surprisingly it was kept to the minimal and we stayed on level and we couldn t hear any single thing awesome love everything about this hotel worth the money spent it made our time in paris experience that much more memorable thank you hotel beauchamps
