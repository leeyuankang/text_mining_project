everything fantastic stay at the hotel enjoyed a lovely nights sleep and quiet attention to detail superb i am a coffee fan and was pleased too see the kettle in the room was spotless inside not all full of limescale and quality filter coffee bags on the coffee tray which were really appreciated and coincidentaly my favourite type really impressed with every aspect of this hotel and will definately return
