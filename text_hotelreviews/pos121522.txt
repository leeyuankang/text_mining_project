lovely large comfy bed clean room apart from dodgy towel out of town so easy to get to with car but with excellent shops restaurants bars close at hand metro station a few steps away to get you into the hub the car parking felt safe and was very good once we worked it out it was great as an overnight stop but would seriously consider staying longer good value for paris
