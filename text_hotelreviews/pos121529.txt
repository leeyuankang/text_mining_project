extremely convenient location close to rer b direct to cdg airport as well as orlybus to orly at denfert rochereau away easy access to the metro and buses to take you to wherever you would like to go in paris eg bus which stops in front of the hotel passes st germain de pres musee d orsay the louvre the opera and galeries lafayette printemps department stores along its route traffic along the street is relatively heavy but i have not been bothered on my stays i ve stayed on the and floor and with a c you do not need to keep the windows open staff are helpful enough without being overwhelmingly so breakfast is decent value but if you have the time to stroll around there are better options in the neighbourhood rooms are well equipped and clean the beds are great very good bathrooms if judging by paris standard very good selection of restaurants along rue daguerre which is a block and a half away also l ordonnance restaurant deserves a special mention also about blocks away but in the opposite direction from rue daguerre
