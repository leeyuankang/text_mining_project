i did not take the breakfast so cannot evaluate that for the costs in paris i think it was a very good deal i ve been in small elevators in europe but this takes the prize i was one person and had a inch suitcase and a carry on and i could not have fit another paperclip in the elevator and there is only one several times in the morning i was on floor which i believe was the highest i would walk down because it took too long to try to get elevator i figured out that the day i left i needed to allow plenty of extra time in case the elevator was booked by someone else i had to have the elevator then once i came home in the evening i was reluctant to go out again because of how difficult the elevator situation was i know i ve dwelt a lot on this but overall i know how expensive hotel rooms are and for the most part this was a good experience the room was very tight in the way furniture was arranged and it was not easy to figure out how to use my laptop on the small desk the staff was very good and i m appreciative of their assistance since i did travel solo hotel is right across the street from metro i do wish i had figured out however how convenient the bus stop was it didn t involve all those stairs that the metro did you could see things on the surface of the streets but that was my fault great location clean reasonably priced for high cost paris and appeared safe i did like the heated towel rack it was handy for rinsing out some clothing items and they dried quickly i did appreciate the mini bar so i could store water or soda bottles and fruit or yogurt i liked the safe
