the room is newly renovated althought we did not like the decoration style it should be underlined that the facilities are new and the decoration is fresh on the website the room example looked much better that in the reality we appreciated the fridge safe box coffe maker in the room and free water offered by the hotel but only for the first night the breakfast is good and various as for the french standards also meat cheese yogurts not only croissants and confiture however after days remain very monotonous for ex eggs only in one style des oeufs brouilles and already prepared so not really freshly cooked and always the same type of ham or cheese or even pastries the lady at the breakfast was correct but not friendly without any smile we liked also the balcony on the floor it was convenient to have a look on the paris streets we appreciate also a nice welcome at the reception the day of our arrival by alexandre very professional and kind person we appreciated also a good location not very far from the metro station and in a lively area
