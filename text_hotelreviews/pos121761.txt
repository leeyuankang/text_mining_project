from attentiveness to every little detail of guest comfort to superior help from front desk staff with anything at any time this was truly a gem of a hotel situated in a lovely kensington neighborhood within minute walk to earl s court tube station i couldn t have asked for a better place to stay on my first trip to london highly recommend
