the staff is the best i ve come across anywhere in the world even the fanciest shmanciest hotels can t beat these helpful knowledgeable and kind people they made early check in easy and gave us great recommendations for things to do and places to eat and they went above and beyond i had an accident outside the hotel the manager and her team rushed to take care of me and my son what could have been a scarring event for both of us was soon forgotten about thank you
