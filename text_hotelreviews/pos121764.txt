staff were very friendly and accomodating to our every need they even gave us the option of changing our rooms as we were initially placed in the basement which we did not loke at the start but ended up staying there due to the level of comfort of the rooms it was also around the corner from earl s court unerground station with plenty of food options within a min walking distance from the hotel to choose from they also offer discount codes to guests staying in the hotel to use in nearby restaurants and cafes which we found to be very nice
