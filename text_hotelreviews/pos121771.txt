very clean and really appreciated the kitchenette with fridge sink filtered water and dishes small room but had a good size bathroom kitchenette and closet air conditioning was a bonus it was within a few blocks of a subway station a main thoroughfare with restaurants and amenities but with just enough distance to be quiet at night the staff was wonderful and happily held our bags when we arrived too early to check in and when we checked out but wanted to keep touring the city for a while
