staff very friendly and helpful clean and comfortable rooms good location useful kitchenette had thought about putting extra towels in bathroom which we so often don t get when travelling with children thank you staff gave our daughter a small duck as a gift which was a lovely touch we parked our car at the hotel whilst it was not a car park as such was very secure and a great service for us
