the hotel is a very cosy bolthole furnished in contemporary style and with very good fittings i chose it for the convenience to earl s court station which is very accessible to heathrow and because i had previously enjoyed staying at the soho nadler i was able to check in early after an early arrival at heathrow which was very helpful
