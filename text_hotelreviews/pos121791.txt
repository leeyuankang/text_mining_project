lovely boutique hotel set in a relatively quiet area off earls court high street great location within walking distance of the tube strange thing to say but the hotel was not only spotless but it actually smelled fresh and clean all of the staff were marvellous from front of house to the cleaners many thanks in particular to pauline in reception great bed so glad we upgraded from small double to king size great location for seeing the sites we don t get to london that often and have stayed in less than a dozen boutique style hotels but we would stay here next time and would recommend it
