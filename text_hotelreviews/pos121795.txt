the location is perfect short walking or tube distances to anywhere you would want to visit and explore in london so quick and easy to take public transportation from the airport the greatest surprise was the size of the room for adults and children it was enormous we could not have been more comfortable the beds were comfortable and the linens were fresh and inviting the bathroom was modern and spacious as well the kitchenette was a lovely surprise and very functional all in all a true out of i almost forgot the staff were friendly and helpful shops bars and restaurants abound i would happily stay here again and highly recommended it to others a real gem
