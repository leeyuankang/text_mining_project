having spent almost hours traveling to london i was greeted with much warmth and enthusiasm from the concierge on duty always a plus when one is jet lagged the hotel while located close to the underground station is situated in a quieter area off main streets each room is allocated its own wifi login so that usage is not hampered by other residents i also appreciated the fact hotel residents are given a discount at selected restaurants in the vicinity although the room has sufficient kitchen amenities to prepare small meals
