i m so glad that we stayed here the staff were wonderful the room was so clean the wifi was reliable and the amenities were great we liked having the kitchenette if you re like us exploring supermarkets in a foreign country is always fun and having a microwave makes it possible to enjoy some of your gastronomic discoveries the location was also super convenient considering the general caliber of hotels in london this one felt like a real gem
