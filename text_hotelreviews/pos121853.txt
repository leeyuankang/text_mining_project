peaceful and quiet hotel in a nice neighbourhood we travelled with two kids age of and the hotel room was clean and we had enough space even with two extra beds the kitchen corner was useful we will definitely come back one day there was a good choice of restaurants and breakfast places near the hotel the location was perfect very quick access to the airport
