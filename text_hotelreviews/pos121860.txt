this is an excellent hotel in a great location and very good staff the bedroom and bathroom were very well furnished and there was no noise from adjacent rooms or from outside a big plus no meals served but the kitchenette with fridge microwave sink and expresso coffee maker more than made up for this only a minute walk from earl s court station
