great location close to earls court tube station location is in a quiet residential area our room was very small but that s what we paid for for stays more than a night or two i d suggest spending a little extra for a bigger room wifi was excellent small kitchenette with microwave sink and tea coffee making facilities was a good feature numerous eating choices and supermarkets close by so the fact no breakfast is available at this hotel was not a problem i would definitely recommend this hotel
