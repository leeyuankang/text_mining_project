the room was really cozy and yet stylish the shower was great the staff at the reception were really helpful and you could get all sorts of things i d forgotten like a shower cap and body lotion the nespresso machine and microwave in the room made it possible to make breakfast in our room especially with a huge sainsbury s just down the street and the room was cleaned to perfection
