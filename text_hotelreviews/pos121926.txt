the staff are naturally friendly and helpful treat you like an individual rather than one of a number especially the young gentleman on reception whilst it is not difficult to find your bedroom they always show you to your room which immediately makes you felt looked after and ensures you have no hassle in locating the correct room they also pointed me in the direction of a few restaurants with a discount card from the hotel this is the second time i ve stayed at a nadler hotel and equally as outstanding as the first stay
