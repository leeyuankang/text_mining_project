the location is excellent just a short walk away from the tube lots of eateries within walking distance as well the beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were very ample and modern i loved the magnifying mirror and all the extras in the wet bar there was always wifi available at no charge throughout the property the best part of all however was the staff so warm and accommodating truly treated us like family
