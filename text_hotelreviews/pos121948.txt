the best small hotel in london great location in a quiet mainly residential area of kensington but near to a mix of bars restaurants and cafes to suit all tastes and close to underground stations as well this hotel is a new concept that absolutely works primarily because the staff are excellent and totally committed to making it work the idea is that as you are in london you will get out and experience all that the capital has to offer and the staff are amazing in making this happen
