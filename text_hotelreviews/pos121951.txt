everything about the nadler reminds its guests of a more gracious bygone age closer to downton abbey than a noisy crowded modern hotel our room was small but very comfortable its design made excellent use of the available space and its amenities were terrific a lovely shower and a fully stocked little dinette for example besides being an elegant old world establishment the nadler boasts a wonderful staff of young energetic concierges who cannot do enough for their guests my husband and i really enjoyed our stay in london and the nadler was a large part of that memorable experience
