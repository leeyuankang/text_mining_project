this was a very nice modern boutique hotel on a quiet street only a short walk away from a subway station the room was beautiful quiet and comfortable the staff was friendly and helpful it was easy to get from heathrow airport to the hotel and back again there was a grocery store few blocks away so we could make use of the small kitchen with microwave in our room south kensington is a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance of some of london s sites and museums
