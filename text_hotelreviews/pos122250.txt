we knew we wanted to stay in saint germain des pres and narrowed it down to two small hotels we ended up choosing hotel da vinci because of location closer proximity to river because we planned to walk to most attractions and the private spa we couldn t be happier with our choice the room and bathroom were small but perfect everything was well designed to maximize use of space and the size made it easy to get ready in the morning the shower was the best with unbelievably great water pressure the hairdryer could dry any head of hair in no time flat the room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable most important everything was spotless the spa was wonderful but please book early to get desired time the bottle of prosecco at check in was thoroughly enjoyed we loved every minute thank you to all of the gracious staff
