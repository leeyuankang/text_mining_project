an oasis in one of the nicest neighborhoods in paris five minute walk to the louvre and while the number of semi furnished posh boutiques made me slightly uncomfortable it was a great base for exploring paris i would stay here again great bed great air conditioning really nice staff no complaints at all and i m extremely picky about hotels
