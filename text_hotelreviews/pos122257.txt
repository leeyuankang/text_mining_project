croissants were incredible but the staff was the best part of the hotel they were warm and friendly and very helpful the location is perfect close to the louvre and musee d orsay as well as shopping in the st germain district there are many restaurants to choose from in the area stay here if you enjoy convenience and hospitality and a really great shower
