the hotel staff were amazing we had an emergency and had to cut the trip short by two days the hotel helped us get immediate transportation to the airport ensured we had fresh croissants and pastries tucked away for our long trip ahead and helped load our luggage into the taxi despite pouring rain that morning before boarding the plane the hotel sent me a personal email wishing us well and informing me that they would not charge us for the two additional nights despite leaving without any prior notice the hotel itself is beautiful and somewhere you d aspire to stay more moving though the staff truly in a time when good customer service seems hard to find this hotel went beyond customer service and showed empathy and regard like i ve never experienced whenever i m in paris again there s no doubt where i ll stay and in terms of word of mouth any friend or family traveling to paris now knows where to stay without question
