the staff and location were amazing i don t think i ve ever stayed anywhere where the staff was so eager to help attentive and for those of us who don t speak french had excellent english the private spa tub was wonderful after a long day tickets for museums saved time the cleaning staff were probably the best ever the room and bathroom were always sparkling the room was very small by american standards but this is paris and this is a boutique hotel the quality of the decor and finish of the bathroom and the room itself were beautiful and completely made up for having a small room what you don t get in room space you get in location we walked everywhere many of the major attractions are within easy walking distance the small shop next door is a bounty of amazing home made delicacies and high end pastries we were there every day for baked goods and treated ourselves to various things that we ate on our hotel balcony there was a great crepe place across the street and down a couple doors and the post office one block up a must for sending postcards the hotel was quiet at night as was the street and the bed and bedding were great after a long day there was only one thing we didn t do well with and sadly that would be a deal breaker for us for future visits see other comment section however if you don t have our issues then we would gladly recommend this establishment a huge thank you to everyone who made our stay so wonderful
