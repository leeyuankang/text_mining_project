the staff were outstanding in their helpfulness and charm the lady on reception could not have been more helpful in suggesting restaurants and providing walking routes to interesting places the location of the hotel was superb but the smallness of the room would stop us going back to this hotel the breakfast was good though given the number of english and american guests it is surprising that they do not provide toast
