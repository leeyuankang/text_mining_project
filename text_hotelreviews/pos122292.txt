the hotel is fantastic everything you would expect from a decent hotel but unique enough to make it an enjoyable experience and not just a random name the mona lisa was stolen and hidden here for a while location was perfect within walking distance to everywhere that we wanted with plenty of great cafes and restaurants close by above all the welcome and customer service was exceptional which can t help but make you happy thank you
