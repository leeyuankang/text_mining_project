we booked the hotel da vinci for the final night of our two week honeymoon in europe we had been staying mostly in b bs and decided to splurge on a fancy hotel for the last night of our trip it was so worth it the hotel was beautiful and the service was excellent we booked some time in the pool for the afternoon of our arrival and enjoyed it so much that we booked additional time the next morning the neighborhood is lively and very interesting to walk around and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby we chose to go directly next door to saint p res fleurs picerie and purchased food to go so that we could enjoy it in our lovely room while the hotel was certainly more expensive than our other accommodations it was well worth it to spend our final night in europe living luxuriously the front desk staff were helpful accommodating and incredibly attentive to detail we would absolutely recommend staying here
