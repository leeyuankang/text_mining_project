staff were fantastic extremely helpful nothing was an effort the hotel was cosy and homely a short walking distance of the louvre and arcde triomphe and fantastic small cafe s in the streets behind laundry close by as well the bathroom it self was a bit small however the shower was a good size and the toilet was in a separate room
