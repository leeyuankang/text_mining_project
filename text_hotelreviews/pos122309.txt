the staff were very welcoming and friendly and went above and beyond to make sure not only our stay in the hotel was comfortable but our experience in paris as well you felt you could ask them anything they offered excellent dining suggestions as well as jazz clubs and the best places to shop the hotel is beautifully decorated whilst keeping in theme of its history and the central location was perfect we didn t require any form of transport to look around the area and my mother requires a walking stick overall had the most wonderful time just wish we could have stayed longer
