staff are so friendly and always willing and eager to help in away way room was absolutely gorgeous small but it s paris and all you need to do is sleep in comfort which was so easy here there was also zero noise from other rooms or outside which was lovely to be able to completely relax and shut off the outside so you can get a good nights sleep ready for a busy day walking around paris
