the employers are super nice breakfast is delicious and good priced compared to other hotels in paris i love this hotel the building is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable and big enough beds and pillows are comfy the bathroom has everything you need and the shower has enough room the sink was a little too small though for sure i will stay next time again and will suggest to everyone thank you
