i travel months of the year and often use booking com for my reservations and i have rarely taken time to write a review however the rosewood compels me to make an exception since the first time i walked through the doors of this hotel it has felt like i second home the service operates on a completely different level than most it could contend with the four seasons any day their attention to detail is so mindfully considered and observing the staff is like theatre their resident dog pearl is a gentle soul too the interiors of the hotel are completely inspired you could gaze for hours in the mirror room and never tire the room sizes are considerable by london standards and the location is perfect walking distance to a variety of sites and amenities the brunch at their holborn restaurant and cocktails at scarfes bar are memorable i have recommended this hotel to everyone i know visiting london many have gone and we all have share the same sentiments that this establishment is a place that everyone should experience at least once in their life as you will be better for it
