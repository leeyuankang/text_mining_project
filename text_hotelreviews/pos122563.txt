rooms are always clean the linen is very soft and fine our mattress had clean a very clean mattress protector i looked the bathroom was very clean too the sealer around the edged of the bathtub were totally white no mould at all and this give you a good chance to relax there was also no damp smell in the room at all greeting staff are absolutely lovely and they made us feel at home impeccable taste just arriving into the courtyard if you have been before it s truly as though you are staying at a very large private estate staff are kind and do not make assumptions i didn t feel any sort of biased attitude i am of latin american ascendance the staff at the reception desk were familiar and respectful very pleasant and patient in our opinion it is great that they do not wear name badges it gives it a very personal touch because rather than reception staff from a conventional hotel they are your hosts i also would like to add that the recently opened hair salon matthew curtis really rounds things up he and his partner were nothing but welcoming friendly professional and add great value to the hotel amenities
