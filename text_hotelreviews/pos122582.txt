what did i not like i came for a night stay for part conference and part leisure and ended up extending my stay for another nights the room was well appointed bed super comfortable and room decor very classy the staff were exceptionally attentive and yet unobtrusive i especially must note the service attention given especially when i extended one night and then another night with the assistance from marcus at the front desk the hotel was fully booked and he went out of the way to search for availability just so i could stay another night there are some small standing bird aviaries on the landing between floors and the budgies they house does add an unusual feel to thw place i also enjoyed the hour all day breakfast which means you can order it anytime in that hour stay delicious with the full english breakfast and danish pastries coffee toast and jam selection wonderful but a lillte too much for me i had to forgo the pastries altogether the rosewood london is certainly one of the finest establishments i have stayed in for a long time and it is the personal touch that made it stand out for me thank you marcus thank you rosewood a very special place indeed
