this hotel is beautiful from the charming courtyard entry the lobby and the rooms the rooms were very comfortable and quiet the staff was amazing we were celebrating our anniversary and when we came home from a dinner the staff had surprised us with rose petals romantically placed around the room they gave us an amazing bottle of champagne along with a personalized chocolate cake this honestly made our anniversary a memorable one i absolutely loved this hotel and wouldn t even consider staying anywhere else when i go back to london
