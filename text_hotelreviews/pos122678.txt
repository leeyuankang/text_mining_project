my stay at this luxury hotel which has undergone an extensive refurbishment beds are the comfiest around rooms are spacious and the staff are incredibly courteous and friendly the hotel even has its own pet labrador roaming the reception area just lovely like a ships cat but live music in scarfes bar every night was an extra special touch
