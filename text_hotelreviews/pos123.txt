this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority it is starting to look frayed at the edges but there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good the location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam
