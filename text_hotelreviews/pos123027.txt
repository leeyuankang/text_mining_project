i had my birthday in paris and the hotel was so nice they gave me a card and free use of the minibar and also a nespresso machine for free use and a bouquay of fruits truly nice i also enjoyed the fact that the bathroom was seperated from the toilet and each had it s own room very smart and hard to get in modern hotels the whole service team was excellently friendly and very nice and helpful
