the staff was incredibly helpful i was thrilled to have my room ready when arrived tired after a long flight was incredibly grateful for the room upgrade as i was staying for nights the location connection to transport and proximity to the sites and restaurants all made this hotel a wonderful home away from home when travelling for work i would definitely come back
