the location just around the corner from earl s court station was great bought an oyster card and caught the train everywhere even to heathrow we were happy with the size of our room and the bathroom good to have a window that opened to let a cool breeze and fresh air inside considering its closeness to a busy road the room was quiet even with the window opened we enjoyed sitting in the outdoor garden whilst killing a bit of time before leaving comfortable pillows and good continental breakfast
