the apartment we stayed in was great lovely fresh large apartment with our own balcony the location was a couple of minutes walk from earls court tube station so was easy to get around breakfast was served over the road at the mayflower hotel every morning basic breakfast of toast jams croissants and cereals but was still nice to have before our days out i made full use of the fresh coffees and juices overall a very pleasant stay
