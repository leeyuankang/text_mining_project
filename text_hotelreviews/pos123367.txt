this flat was superb we were a little concerned at check in when the reception desk at the hotel told us the flat was about a minute walk away but it was literally no more walk than they said and the place was immaculate there was a fairly large kitchen diner lounge with a separate bedroom and ensuite bathroom everything looked virtually brand new throughout and the bed was very comfortable it had everything you would need for a longer stay with washing machine dishwasher etc but unfortunately we were only there for the night the flat was actually better than the photos on the website suggested which i don t think i ve ever come across before
