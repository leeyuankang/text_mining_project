really helpfull staff at reception hotel is literally down the road from earls court tube station so excellent location for a trip to london to see the sights we missed breakfast we went down on the saturday and there was a long que to get in so we went elsewhere room was nice marbled shower room and toilet shower was leaking at the top but overall pretty good we were able to leave our luggage at no extra cost on our last day so that was a bonus pretty good hotel and not a bad price for london to be fair though i wouldn t pay over to stay here again
