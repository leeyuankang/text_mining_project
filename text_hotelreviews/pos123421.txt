everything was just perfect the location the design of the hotel room corridors and reception was just soo warming and welcoming staff were soo friendly and literally after talking to them for two minutes it felt like you been friends for years it honestly was a wonderful experience in everything and can not wait to go back there soon i can t say i have a complaint about anything the rooms were lovely the staff were fabulous train station was only a few minutes round the corner breakfast was nice too self service though and reminded me of a harvester continental breakfast which is great because i love the option of croissants cereals toast or fruit and unlimited tea coffee and orange juice first thing in the morning
