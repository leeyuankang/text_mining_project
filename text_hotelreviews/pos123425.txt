hotel was clean and in good repair morning papers in the lounge were a nice touch staff were very friendly and helpful keys were super adorable for less than cad night what a deal very cute little neighbourhood and less than minute walk to an underground station that will get you anywhere you want to go from heathrow and minutes from tower hill
