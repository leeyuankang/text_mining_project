everything was very good there was no window in the room but considering the location and structure it was okay the location was perfect despite located on one of the main shopping streets the room was quite quiet and the staff tried very hard to make sure i stay comfortably breakfast was also good including standard menu main menus are cooked based on my selection and there are always local sweets along with fruits travel desk was also very helpful spa on the top floor was also nice i would definitely stay there next time
