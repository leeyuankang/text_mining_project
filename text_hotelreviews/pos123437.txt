this little apartment right next to the railway station in earls court was a great place to stay on a budget in london it was easy to get into the heart of london via a bus or the train and took about minutes a good supermarket bakery and coffee shop are just a few minutes walk so self catering was really easy the apartment had everything we needed was warm and quiet
