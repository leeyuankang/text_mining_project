the apartment was a fabulous surprise i have never stayed in such a wonderful apartment in the centre of london the bedroom was divine comfy bed plenty of storage the decor was modern the bathroom spacious wonderful mirrors kitchen lounge gorgeous i was so sad to leave honestly i will be back and i would strongly recommend this hotel the windows are double glazed and believe me i am a light sleeper and i could hear the tubes oh and there is air con before i booked this apartment i read nearly all of the reviews and for those who moan about scaffolding you must see this as a positive they are really improving this property and i am excited to come back in a few months time to see how it has developed
