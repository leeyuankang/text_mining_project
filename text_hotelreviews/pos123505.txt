i m sorry but we were not happy with our stay here we were moved to a sister boutique around the corner on check in i would like to add that the lady on check in was very sweet and lovely however when we got to our room it was in the basement and seemed very cramped it did smell a little damp and it was very cold we did have to ask for an extra heater the wifi just did not work in the basement and this was a problem as i work from my laptop the breakfast was nothing great to be honest we travel alot and this was not up to scratch on many levels and i think it is hugely overpriced they do offer tea and coffe which is reasonable but we will not stay here again
