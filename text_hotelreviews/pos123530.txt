this hotel is ideally located with all major attractions easily accessible from the nearby underground we needed flexibility with meals so we stayed in a one bedroom flat with a full kitchen and loved it there s a hour grocery store within walking distance the flat was small but cozy clean and nicely updated unlike a private rental we also had access to the services from the main hotel room cleaning breakfast and a front desk for any emergencies i would definitely stay here again
