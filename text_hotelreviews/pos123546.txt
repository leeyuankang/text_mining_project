the hotel was conveniently located right around the corner of earls court underground station with access to hired bicycles and buses too lots of pubs cafes and restaurants around the area too the piccadilly line and district line make it easy to get to central london in no time the value you for money was incredible for it s location and if you are happy to have a continental breakfast in the morning this is the place for you the staff were very friendly also and remembered their guests faces very well
