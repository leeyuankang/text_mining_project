continental breakfast was good especially the croissants bed was very comfortable room was very clean and quiet the shower room was small but perfectly formed and imaculately clean staff were pleasant and helpful everything seemed very well organised the only downside was that the rooms were small we were glad that we had opted to upgrade however we were out all day and only used the rooms for sleeping so their small size was not too much of a problem we stored our luggage on our day of departure and it was quickly retrieved when we returned to collect it location was very good a mere or minute walk to earls court tube station
