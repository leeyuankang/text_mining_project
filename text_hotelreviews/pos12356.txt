we were three travelers and the room was pretty tight for three people but that is europe for you the location was very close to notre dame and it was very easy to walk everywhere in the city great restaurants nearby friendly bilingual staff we were on the top floor and a heavy rain storm resulted in the ceiling leaking over the third bed they immediately provided an extra room for my dad for no additional charge wifi worked perfectly took the train metro to the airport due to traffic which was great location about an hour from airport which would have been an extremely expensive cab ride we chose to get breakfast at nearby restaurants so can t comment on the food
