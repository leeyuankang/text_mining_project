we stayed at an apartment which was actually across the street of this hotel we had alot of space which made it comfortable they just renovated last year so the apartments do not look like the ones on the photos they actually did a great job with the renovations the powerful though noisy rain shower made a long day worth the relaxing shower location was fantastic very close to the train station and a grocery is nearby too the main road had alot of restaurants too advise is to stay away from the indian restaurant called masala zone which was overpriced for the portions and flavour breakfast was an ordinary continental nothing special the very small two rooms for breakfast made us feel like we were in a very small cafe in paris get in early to avoid the pack of people and the very annoyed and stressed staff if you want hot food you need to shell out at least there are not enough healthy options at this hotel which made us use our apartment more for breakfast value for money would have been great if only staff were better more friendlier not going back though after the staff experience when one is on a holiday specially celebrating my wife s birthday you wouldn t want to get stressed right
