earl s court station is less than minutes away with access to both piccadilly and district circle lines lots of restaurants and cafes are located near the hotel they had no issues with keeping our bags after check out other hotels in london do so or they may charge you a small fee complimentary tea coffee was available and restock daily in the room the bathroom was quite spacy odd thing for london in my experience the room basic cheap one was a bit larger than what i expected probably as big as kensington holiday s inn s executive rooms
