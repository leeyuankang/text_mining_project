i originally was booked for a studio apartment but upon arrival i was upgraded to a apartment for free i even stayed extra nights for a total of nights because it was so nice they let me keep my upgraded room for the extra nights at the original price the staff is helpful and knowledgeable the breakfast was enough for my needs they served a variety of breads rolls croissants cheeses meats fresh fruit greek and flavored yogurts types of cereals juices milk water coffee tea and jams the apartment was clean and huge way more than what i needed it had couches in the living room a fully functioning kitchen very nice tv washing machine and a bathroom the facilities are a bit worn but this is london you will be hard pressed to find a brand new apartment for this price anywhere the location was the best part it was a minute walk to the earl s court underground access to the district and picadilly lines very nice grocery stores restaurants post office gym and so many more little shops and places to eat
