the location of the hotel is great just around the corner from earls court station and a walk to london olympia exhibition centre the staff are so friendly at the hotel and could not fault them they seemed genuinely interested in making your stay enjoyable we got upgraded to the suite on arrival and we were pleasantly surprised and happy i would have absolutely no problem recommending this hotel to anyone
