excellent location extremely central yet quiet due to being tucked away from the main street on the charming little square in front of sorbonne the rooms are modern and decently sized we re in paris all the staff is always very friendly helpful and professional the wifi works just fine the area is full of a perfect mix of interesting shops restaurants and sights to visit
