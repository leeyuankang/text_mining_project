the region of jardin de luxembourg is a great location you re a bit away from the masses near the eiffel tower but there s still plenty around to do in walking distance ile de paris with the notre dame the jardin de luxembourg itself the pantheon and i could go on for a while more the hotel and our room was very clean the combination of authentic and new elements see pictures of the breakfast room vs the entrance hall worked remarkably well the staff was very kind we got upgraded to a better room with a splendid view room sight of the university building and place de la sorbonne the nights were quiet the room was well equipped what more can one wish for hotel select and its room are definitely a recommendation
