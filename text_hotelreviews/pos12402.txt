first of all i have to say that amazing people are working at this hotel marie helen laure nordine and mazier it is impossible to accept them just as staff these people are great people warm and attentive with lovely sense of humor making you to feel that you are surrounded with close and really caring friends that s simply their nature the hotel itself is nicely designed i was staying on the floor the room was functional and clean with very comfortable bed it was a bit small i mean the room but you don t waste time in the hotel room when you are in paris the location of the hotel is perfect in between two metro stations luxembourg and saint michel next to sorbone and a few steps from pantheon there is a bus station about m from the hotel although in the middle of the city it was quite and peaceful the fountains on the plateau in front of the hotel were creating a specific atmosphere when in the room the feeling was like you are out of the city near some river or waterfall very relaxing there was an espresso making machine in the room with both regular and decaf coffee capsules and with a selection of tea breakfast was good nothing spectacular just good some standard ham and salami couple of traditional french cheese home made jam selection scrambled eggs with sausage croissant if you are staying in a hotel for more than one night a bit fantasy while creating the breakfast menu would be highly appreciated but again everything was very fresh nice and positive if your breakfast is not included in the room price you can have your morning coffee with fresh croissant for euro just on the other side of the street also there are some restaurants and a marks and spencer express shop nearby in case of an emergency all in all it was really a positive experience definitely recommended hotel for your paris stay
