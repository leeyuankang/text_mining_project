the location was excellent we had the great good luck of being upgraded to a large room overlooking place de la sorbonne even though the street had traffic during the day the windows and air conditioning were spectacularly effective in making the room quiet from this location we walked easily to sites the pantheon jardin de luxembourg musee cluny and just wandered around the small streets of the latin quarter we could not have been more pleased with the location the hotel and especially the desk staff
