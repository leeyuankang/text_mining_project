i didnt like anythig room too small asked for an upgrade it was denied i told the reception that i was staying for days not or she said it doesn t matter we dont upgrade people if you want another room you have to pay more the bathroom had a horrible odor and we complained the ac sistem was ridiculous we have to call every night for them to put it on in our day the sheets where dirty and i have to tell them to change sheets they did not vaccum the bathroom everything we ever asked it was a no answer the reception is awful for a star boutique hotel the worst part we ask one night where to go for a italian restaurant they send us to this cheap place call i believe bonissimo i had a pasta with salmon the next day i woke up with an alergy all over my face went to pharmacy for medication the reception never said hello or even good night they are not friendly at all i can go on and on just an awful experience with so many other hotels to choose i think booking com should not place this hotel as a star hotel
