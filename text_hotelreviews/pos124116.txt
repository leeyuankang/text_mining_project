these guys are the new kids on the block beautiful classic building recently upgraded to a very high quality took a single room and it was a great deal as the bed was still big enough and there was more living space around it than a double one including a nice little desk rita at reception was very helpful in sorting my checkout one day early in no time lovely ad century mosaics on display in the lobby area fresh grapes chocolate covered nuts a red rose and mineral water in a glass bottle accompanied by a welcome note signed by the gm i will definitely return highly recommend the place lancaster gate station or queensway are short walks away but a number of double decker buses also cover the area so that you start your day with a nice journey overlooking hyde park rather than counting the stops on the tube
