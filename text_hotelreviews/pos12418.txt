i stayed here for nights and breakfast was provided with the price of the room the location i very convenient close to several metro lines and also a minute walk from major attractions like the seine notre dame pantheon sainte chapelle etc the area felt very safe and there are tons of restaurants and cafes nearby it is also a short distance from shopping areas staff was very friendly and helpful the room we had was facing the street and we got a great view of a nearby chapel and the water fountain and in the evenings musicians would be playing at the cafe downstairs we were also surprised that the room was a bit bigger than what was in the pictures online breakfast was included for us which was great because the food was definitely solid and there was a wide variety to choose from i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in the center of paris close to tourist attractions
