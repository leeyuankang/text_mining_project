beautiful location near lovely restaurants and cafes shopping center minutes away tube station mins walk away mins from central london but in a lovely part of ealing quite at night with lovely staff would definitely recommend great value for money loved the chinese decor and the book in the room on how to read chinese very interesting was expecting a very small room as norm for london but was pleasantly surprised to find a spacious and vibrant room will definitely be back again
