it s an elegant warm and welcoming place in an elegant residential part of london that is five minutes from sloane square and the king s road they upgraded me to a remarkably large beautifully furnished room with a gas fireplace staff is lovely and low key it has some wonderfully old fashioned touches separate hot and cold taps in the bathroom sink for example but a perfectly modern shower but is extremely comfortable like having a house in belgravia
