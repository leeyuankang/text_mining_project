the hotel is like home from home i felt instantly at home with its great drawing room its sofas the view over the garden the choice of decoration i appreciated the little things like tea and biscuits champagne from hot chocolate after staff was most attentive and polite always with a smile my room was spacious well furnished the bed comfortable the pillows soft the bathroom was extremely clean and looked brand new with proper power shower soft towels and nice toiletries the room had airconditioning which was handy the location could not be better with peter jones just around the corner and a min walk to sloane sq station just loved it
