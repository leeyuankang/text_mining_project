the draycott is a very well located hotel and has a delightful personal and comfortable ambience it felt rather like visiting a beautiful home with butler service and the guest name card in the brass holder on the door added to that impression although some guests may prefer anonymity and i m sure that would be respected staff were always available pleasant and helpful the room was very spacious and comfortable and overlooked cadogan garden which guests have access to from the hotel sitting room it was a wood panelled room which would multitask for small meetings rather than a pretty room but very comfortable nevertheless i was too busy on this trip to enjoy a walk in the gardens of their complimentary tea and champagne but i will be back
