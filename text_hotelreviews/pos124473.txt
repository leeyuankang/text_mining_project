it was exquisite so well furnished beautiful decor large homely rooms the staff were all so very attentive with a kind demeanor and very good manners nothing was too much trouble location was perfect the room was quiet bed large and comfortable the added luxury of the offer of champagne in the evening and hot choc during the night was a delight although i didn t partake on this visit it was lovely to know it was an option breakfast delivered to my room was one of the best i have had in any hotel all fresh delicious generous quantities perfectly presented i will definitely stay again
