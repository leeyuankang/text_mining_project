the overall day experience at the select hotel was outstanding the staff was superb with special thanks to naomi the day manager the room hotel was absolutely the best we have experienced in paris to date visits over years and a great value we have paid much more for less quality in the past great view of square university of paris and cluny museum and notre dame in the distance room amenities were excellent we will return to this hotel in the future great hotel
