comfortable and clean hotel in an interesting location it s not exactly what i would call a boutique hotel though it is large breakfast felt like an all inclusive impersonal no nice touches and there is nothing really special about it the short boat trip across to canary warf pier is pleasant although you do have to factor in more time when going from a to b sitting outside on the terrace is nice but be warned if you order small bottles of water at the bar to take to your room they will cost you nearly which does include an unbelievable service charge fortunately this was deducted from my bill when i expressed my disgust
