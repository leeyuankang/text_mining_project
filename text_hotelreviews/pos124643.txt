food was excellent both the breakfast evening meal the restaurant staff were extremely helpful polite friendly especially dinos francis the bed was so comfy george on reception was very helpful polite shame about the other reception staff if it wasn t for the food bed restaurant staff i would never step foot in the hotel again it is only those points that made me give it a reasonable review
