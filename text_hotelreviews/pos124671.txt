really nice hotel nice staff and a cookie on arrival the boat was great but it was very difficult to get back at night the main bridge was closed and this was out of the hotels hands but keep this in mind if you re trying to get back on the night tube the bed was so comfortable it was very clean and easy to check in and out the bed had been made and we had fresh towels when we got back in we agree with the little signs in the bathroom asking for you to reuse the towels tho
