an excellent property living up to the hilton standards that you would expect we had a queen room which has a view of the thames the staff all went above and beyond with their customer service the rooms were spotless as were all other areas within the hotel an excellent breakfast selection with waiter waitress service a nice touch was the free ferry across to the hotel from canary wharf included in the cost of your stay
