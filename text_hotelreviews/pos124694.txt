i loved the staff so friendly and welcoming the bonus was at breakfast where the chef personally introduced herself and we then had the breakfast manager do the same this attention to detail is impressive the boat to the hotel was a bonus and the fantastic views across the thames to canary wharf rooms were much nicer than i expected
