i have been to many double tree hilton hotels and every single time i have left satisfied with my stay the staff at the reception make you feel very welcome and are always very enthusiastic i was at double tree in docklands and i cant remember her name but a lady at reception did everything she could to accommodate to our needs she even upgraded our room and that little touch of giving us cookies as we finished checking in was nice in addition our room was lovely with the added touch of a balcony to enjoy the views of london overall we had a lovely stay at double tree as per usual
