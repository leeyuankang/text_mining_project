the hotel was lovely and very quirky the best bit was the terrace was right on the riverside lovely seating areas heaters blankets and all lit up at night lovely to have coffee on the terrace in the morning the omelettes that were cooked for breakfast were to die for and a truly excellent breakfast the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced the staff were really helpful and friendly and the hotels surroundings were lovely would love to return again the ferry service from the hotel was also brilliant with attentive staff and was very reliable
