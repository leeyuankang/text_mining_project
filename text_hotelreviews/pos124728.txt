amazing service from the staff who went out of their way to ensure my needs were met the view from our room was amazing and overlooking canary wharf and the with the river on one side and a distant view of the city from the other side of the balcony we were offered free return boat tickets from the hotel into canary wharf and the breakfast was scrumptious would definitely return special thanks to maria the front desk supervisor who provided an amazing service
