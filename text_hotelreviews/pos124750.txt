amazing staff in every area of the hotel attentive polite and just happy in general which as a guest is a big thing for me when arriving the breakfast was incredible and the view overlooking the thames was just as impressive the rooms were clean spacious and the balcony we had was a nice touch my girlfriend and i loved it and the surrounding area combined with the ferry service just topped it off for us we will be back
