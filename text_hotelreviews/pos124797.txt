the room was lovely with nice views and quite spacious this is if you get the bigger rooms the normals ones are nice but not great views and smaller this room was very comfortable clean location was good not far from greenwich and other desired destinations free ferry breakfast included overall very good value for money also very welcoming staff especially eugenijiz probably wrong spelling
