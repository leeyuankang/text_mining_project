the fresh cookie on arrival was a nice touch as a welcome to the hotel staff were very friendly throughout the whole stay nothing was too much transport links to and from the hotel were great we took advantage of the free ferry on a few occasions which took you to within about a minute walk to the canary wharf tube stop or there was a bus stop right outside the hotel which took you to the canada water tube stop otherwise this particular stop would be a long walk from the hotel both the ferry and the bus were very regular the hotel was nicely decorated if you have some down time i would suggest popping into the library where you can settle with a book and a glass of wine infront of one of the roaring fires the only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast absolutely no complaints here it was a plentiful and really good quality the toiletries in the bathroom were lovely also crabtree evelyn overall a fab stay
