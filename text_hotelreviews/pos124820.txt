the hotel itself was lovely and clean with a great view from reception of canary wharf over the thames the room was very clean and spacious we were greeted with warm cookies upon arrival nice touch parking located under hotel which was good as we travelled in our car free unlimited use of the hotels own boat to cross the thames to canary wharf we used this quite a lot to get on the tube at canary wharf very quiet area however the tube was abit of a journey overall a good stay
