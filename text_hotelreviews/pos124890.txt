i had an amazing night at the double tree in the docklands the room was very clean and beautiful with a balcony staff were very friendly who generously upgraded my room with a kingsize bed a great thing is you get free unlimited rides on the ferry to canary wharf from the hotel a beautiful couples experience would definitely come back
