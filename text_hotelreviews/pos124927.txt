wonderful location with the riverside looking amazing at night you are welcomed by a warm cookie on arrival which is a lovely touch staff were extremely helpful and friendly and were quick to assist when we found our rooms were not warming up and the room phones were not working awesome that a ferry trip across the river was included fantastic breakfast too
