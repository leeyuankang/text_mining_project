stunning location beautiful hotel breakfast was amazing with everything you could think of the staff were friendly rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable we had an amazing river view balcony the view from our room room at night was beautiful the only negative i had was the check in we were supposed to be able to check in at but our was not ready until this was a bit of a let down but we were lots of drinks vouchers and later that evening a complimentary fruit bowl and drinks i would definitely book this hotel again
