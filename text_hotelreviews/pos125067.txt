the hotel was in a perfect location with the complimentary ferry over to canary wharf until at night very handy to go for drinks in the city the bed was so comfortable and big we couldn t hear any noise from other guests in the hotel which was great as this is usually a problem in big hotels we had dinner in the columbia restaurant which was amazing and really good value for money the bar was lovely too and it wasn t too expensive for drinks
