the persons at the front desk were all very helpful and nice the location is ideal for making a short trip to greenwich on the river on the sunny day as well as is convenient for both the underground and dlr the hotel ferry across the river run frequently so the access to canary wharf was good enjoyed the breakfast with the view of a heron and seagulls
