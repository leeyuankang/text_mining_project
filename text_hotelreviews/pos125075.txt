the amazing location for a business trip and the way they made it convenient for leisure travellers too i think going there for vacations must be great as well due to the shuttle boat and the excellent connection with canary wharf jubilee line also a special mention for the restaurant and the sunny terrace from which one can get wifi an amazing spot to work while enjoying the weather the waves on the thames river and the view over canary wharf i m used to staying at hilton and doubletree especially but this one was a very good surprise i d stayed once a couple of years ago but it was winter and i couldn t enjoy the whole facilities
