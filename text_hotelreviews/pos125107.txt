the hotel had a beautiful layout with a classy feel the free boat to and from the other side of the thames was just a thoughtful idea and just adds to your stay the find gesture of the warm chocolate cookies when you check just makes you feel that the staff are going out of there way to welcome you the rooms were so clean and tidy and the views were amazing would per cent recommend this hotel to everybody
