the staff genuinely tried to help with the issues i had however even in helping they didn t really the room we got shifted into was not nice at all a big open space in the room without chairs or anything even though it did have a view of the river sure it didn t feel warm and cosy and romantic i was really disappointed with the whole experience you expect more from a hilton it wasn t cheap either
