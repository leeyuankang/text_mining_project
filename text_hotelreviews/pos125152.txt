the location of this hotel is great we used it as a base for an event at the they offer a free boat service across the thames where you can get the clipper service to the the room was great although our first room was awful but the lady at reception was nice enough to give us an upgrade we had a balcony over looking the thames and it was just really lovely also the bar in this place just go its beautiful just to sit out on the river watching the world go by at whilst having a nice drink and a bite to eat also breakfast is really worth getting huge buffet with really yummy food
