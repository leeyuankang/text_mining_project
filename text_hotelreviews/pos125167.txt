amazing location i loved the fact it way quiet and i fell in love with the design and the location of the hotel you get a pass for the water ferry which took us over the river nice little perk although the hotel itself was a bit of a labyrinth our room was a decent size and had a very pleasant deco pretty quiet only down was that we couldn t access our balcony would ve been nice to sit out w a drink however when mentioned at check out staff very helpfully mentioned to ask on next booking you d like a balcony breakfast amazing restaurant very nice beautiful sitting outside by the river loved it will be defo back w the family
