the bed was extremely comfortable and the room a good size it was lovely having the little balcony and being able to step out to look over the river we left the door open for a while to enjoy the pleasant breeze the complimentary ferry was useful although we preferred taking the bus to canada water to pick up the tube into the city the breakfast menu offered was varied and delicious as the weather was good we enjoyed sitting outside on the terrace to eat all the staff we encountered were polite helpful and professional
