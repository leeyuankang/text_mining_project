bar man knew and remembered our drink choices over the weekend and remembered our room number even though we only went to the bar couple of times this was a lovely special touch also as the trip was for a special occasion we ordered a bottle of bubbles for the first day which was swiftly delivered on check in with a lovely bowl of complimentary fruit thank you
