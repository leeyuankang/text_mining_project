the room was beautiful and well looked after the bar is cosy and quiet the view was over the river and quite stunning at night the free ferry across made it easy to reach the hotel you walk off the boat onto up the quay and then into the hotel lobby which is great the price i got for nights in a superking bed was cheaper than stratford double at a premier inn on that weekend date a no brainer really
