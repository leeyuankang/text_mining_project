great location being just across the river from central london the boat bus was great stayed there for the just a short boat trip over river minutes walk to tube station and one stop to the always a boat available when needed and just made it more exciting also so close to tube station anyway or clipper boat taking you to all of the sites great fun hotel was great very individual with the internal walls and decoration very clean rooms big for london too and we only had basic twin good facilities in room great large shower warm chocolate cookie in reception was a lovely touch too and yummy cocktail bar lovely and breakfast best ive had so much choice couldnt really fault it
