my husband and i stayed at the hotel as we were visiting a show at the arena to celebrate our wedding anniversary my daughter unbeknown to us phoned the hotel and asked for our room to be special the results were amazing i have taken pictures with my ipad but am not sure how to upload them here shortly after our arrival members of staff came to see if we were happy with our room reception staff phoned shortly after to see if the room as okay we had a wonderful stay and i cannot recommend the hotel staff enough for making our stay so special the food and service in the reception were excellent everyone was friendly and helpful i would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel and its staff to anyone
