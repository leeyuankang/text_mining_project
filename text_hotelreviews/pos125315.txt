i spent the weekend here with my partner the hotel was clean and staff were extremely friendly hotel facilities were great and the location of the hotel was ideal as there were a variety of transport options to get you to and from the centre of london we particularly liked the complimentary ferry link between the hotel and canary wharf we had an excellent trip to london and will definitely use this hotel again and recommend it to family and friends too
