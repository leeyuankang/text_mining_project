the manager we have had previously stayed here and had complained about a few issues we had we thought we would try again as the location was great for our trip upon arrival we spoke to the manager who was on the desk for check ins my word if customer service was always like this there would be no complaints we were given a lovely room and he would personally make sure that everything would be to our satisfaction and he did so thank you for making it extra special cookies too how to look after your guests and get them back we have booked again for brilliant
