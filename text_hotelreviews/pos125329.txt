firstly arriving on the riverboat ferry from canary wharf pier to the hotel s private pier was very impressive with the beautiful views of the river thames and surroundings it was definitely a great start our view out the room was superb we had the executive deluxe queens room that overlooked the river with canary wharf into the distance the restaurant for breakfast had a very wide option of different foods ranging from a fry up to fruit yoghurt cereal pretty much anything you can think of was there the restaurant was big and very well decorated busy but well organised
