fantastic location and a lovely hotel recently refurbished we got an upgrade to a room suite having had problems with the booking this room is normally a night and t is easy to see why two double beds tv s lounge area and shower room room and balcony overlooked the thames and canary wharf there is a free ferry boat across the river to canary wharf to the clipper which runs to the centre of london and very convenient for all this nice bar and restaurant with huge selection of options for breakfast we parked under the hotel too will certainly stay here again for and other lady running the restaurant was excellent
