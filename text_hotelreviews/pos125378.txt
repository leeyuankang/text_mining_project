the location what can i say amazin felt like a proper holiday on an island with the free ferry service and water all around and the walkways over the water the outside terrace could have sat there all night with it s view of canary wharf and the blankets sat in every seat in the bar and the library up the stairs with the two fires view of canary wharf and outside balcony proper plush the decor was really indulgent and comforting for us good food in the restaurant too coffee terribly expensive nearly a fiver but okay for a treat was costa the free hot cookie on arrival was a blessing bought a tin
