friendly staff and a great atmosphere it was welcoming and felt sophisticated but relaxed the room was incredibly nice and decorated well free warm cookies on arrival is always a good thing the free ferry trips were incredibly useful and saved us time and money giving us more time to discover little areas we knew nothing about
