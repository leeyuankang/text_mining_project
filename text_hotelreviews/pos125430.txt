the hotel is in a great location a ferry ride across the thames from the hotel s pier to the docklands pier and you re ten minutes from the tube to get you where you need to be we had no problem with parking the car as the street outside the hotel has many spaces for people to choose from or you can pay the and park in the hotel s car park the hotel room was clean and comfortable so no complaints there we had a room up on the floor but it didn t matter to us we didn t eat in the restaurant but the food looked really good overall we had a great weekend
