staff were great did their best if we had a problem always ready to accommodate really friendly and helpful made us feel welcome thank you great with kids smart hotel but not too posh that you are scared to let your kids run around things were made easy for us with kids it was a good balance the location was ideal since located in quieter side of london but great accessibility to tube ferry about ten mins overall to get to the jubilee line with kids obviously faster without kids breakfast options were great beyond what we expected great choses for kids too we would stay again
