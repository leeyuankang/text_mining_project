the hotel was very quiet and the service was good the location was good too had a king room with a great view over canary wharf had access to the executive lounge which was a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the bar the ferry service was really efficient and regular easy to walk to town if you wanted to the breakfast was really enjoyable i would definitely stay here again
