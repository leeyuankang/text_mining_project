the hotel was in good condition with helpful staff room was a good size with lovely aspect and well designed as the hotel has been refitted into an existing victorian warehouse the layout is rather chaotic with tight very narrow corridors and small lifts the lifts were only accessible by first using a flight of stairs just to be clear though overall a satisfactory if pricey stay
