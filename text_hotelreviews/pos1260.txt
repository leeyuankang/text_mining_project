beautiful building courtyard was stunning marvellous location just a short walk from temple tubestation along the thames very pretty the staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday they delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special the lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it the design of the space left a long lasting impression the rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee
