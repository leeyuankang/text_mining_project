very beautiful room and the bathroom was incredible this was a special get away trip for us and we loved the hotel the staff in the peridot breakfast room were so polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble we loved our trip so much that we have booked to come again next year when we attend a show at the royal albert hall it s only a few minutes walk away from the natural history museum which is my favourite thing to visit in london which was a bonus for me too
