the hotel was in a lovely quiet location and the room looked out over gardens so there was absolutely no road noise the staff were able to accommodate our request to have our two rooms close to each other and the spaciousness and standard of furnishings was very good the bed was lovely and comfortable and the room was beautifully clean
