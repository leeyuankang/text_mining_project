when we arrived to check in we were told our booking had been cancelled no one notified us of this prior to our stay we had just travelled for hours to get there the situation did get resolved eventually but the reception staff were unhelpful unfriendly and very unsympathetic even though we hadn t done anything wrong except turn up for our confirmed reservation i even rang a couple of days prior to arrival to confirm out reservation and yet it was still cancelled without our knowledge they said our credit card had been declined when they tried to authorise it which was utter rubbish our credit card is fine in fact we used it to pay when we were eventually allowed to check in we were then allocated the smallest room know to man there literally was not enough room to turn around even though we had booked a deluxe room if that was deluxe i would hate to see a standard room we were so weary from travelling and so relieved that at least we had somewhere to sleep that night that we said nothing and went about our trip its fair to say we will not be staying at this hotel again or booking through booking com as i simply don t trust the process
