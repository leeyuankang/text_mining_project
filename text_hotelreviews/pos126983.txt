my room was very nice roomy could walk around with ease happy that we could control the thermostat very quiet slept very well the bed and the pillows were great plenty of lighting options and two windows nice decor and very clean it was a little bit of a walk for those of us who are used to driving everywhere but the access to the tube was very easy very direct there are also some nice restaurants in the area a chinese restaurant right around the corner and bizarro italian restaurant up the same street about a block
