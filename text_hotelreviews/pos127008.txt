i enjoyed the whole experience of the visit from arriving the staff were very welcoming and helpful the room was beautiful and was better than i had imagined it had everything we needed and more it was a compact room and was indeed compact but it was perfect for of us every member of staff i came across throughout the stay always made an effort to say hello and asked if we needed anything the hotel was spotless and couldn t find any fault what so ever
