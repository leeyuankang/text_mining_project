very good hotel and i was happy with the service i got there the staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful absolute value for money compared to the crazy hotel prices in paris i was supposed to pay much before i checked in since it was a booking that couldn t have been cancelled for some reason the hotel was unable to charge my card i requested them to wait till i arrived for my stay to pay in advance and they gladly accepted that and waited for me mentioning this because i have had instances before where even star hotels have not waited and cancelled my booking so great job by pullman bercy and would absolutely recommend this to others it is close to cour de saint emilion metro station to bercy village and a couple other places where one can hang out mins away from triumph de arc at champs de elysees which is one of the tourist spots too good coffee for breakfast and has a great yellow coloured apricot bread which one must try for sure
