excellent location pleasant and extremely obliging staff comfortable and clean room with tea and coffee making facility and ample supplies of tea coffee and milk replenished on a daily basis good food in the breakfast room and from the bar menu as a distinct plus a number of staff went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating all of which added to a sense of warm welcome i had a club room larger than the average room containing a small fridge and microwave both of which were great for the occasional self catering altogether a happy and memorable stay
