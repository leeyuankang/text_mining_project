park grand is an awesome hotel the staff are super helpful and welcoming the location is amazing as well a short walk to kensington park also very close to the underground which will get you to wherever you need to get in london we had a lovely stay the rooms are cosy and perfect as a base my favourite feature of the room was definitely the heated floor in the bathroom the room is also very clean we will definitely book at the park grand again on our next trip to london
