we were welcomed by very polite staff travelled from birmingham so we kind of arrived early and they happily held our bags until we could check in and sorted out all the paper work so when we came back we could just advance to our room pleasant stay then the next day we accidentally left jackets in the wardrobe but we was already back in birmingham when we realised we phoned the hotel and they shipped them to us the next day
