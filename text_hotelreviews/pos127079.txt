rude manager booked a junior suite and was given a room with beds one double and one single despite my booking was for one person please be careful the club room is really very small and the junior suite you see on the website is not representative as they showed me tiny rooms in the basement and they still call them junior seuits with very small seating area i decided to take the club room instead of the junior suits they showed me as they re smelly in the basement very cold floor which was tiled and not carpeted as you see on the website even the club room is small with single chair squeezed in the corner sadly the staff could not see the problem at that time it s not worth it as there are better and cheaper room in the hotels around it which i tried before with more appreciation
