location was very near the paddington underground matter of minutes walk direct to any part of london room was small but more than suitable for our stay clean and tidy with rainfall shower and under floor bathroom heating there was a nice large tv on the wall and a mobile which had access to free internet that you could take anywhere in london this was really handy so you can save on your own data
