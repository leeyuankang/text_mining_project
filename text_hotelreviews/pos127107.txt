we really enjoyed our stay here the staff were all very lovely the beds were super comfortable and they had black out shades which made sleeping in very easy having the different outlets was very useful and they even had a cell phone you could use we opted for a larger room and the space was fine but it could have been a bit bigger i would be curious how large the regular rooms are the location is great minute walk from paddington station in a lovely little neighbourhood
