good sized room club room with good sized bathroom too right next to elevator which was excellent as i needed to avoid stairs as have knee injuries there are a few stairs by reception to get up to the lifts but there was always a member of staff on hand to lift my luggage those few steps for me breakfast very good and good value location good easy to hail a cab and close to shops bars
