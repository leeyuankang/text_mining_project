good sleep quality beds sound proofing excellent for good nights sleep city view ok but as quite a distance not worth paying extra for car parked for us on arrival one night charge euro which was very convenient the hotel was spotless staff courteous the location great we had dinner in bercy village a short stroll away where there was an abundance of restaurants with sitting in outside a great atmosphere on a saturday night overall would recommend stay again
