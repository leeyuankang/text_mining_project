the hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly the staff on the front desk are always available and willing to help the rooms are small but are comfortable and very clean the bathrooms are excellent with a large spacious shower which is rare in london hotels the hotel also provides very fluffy bathrobes and slippers which is a nice touch along with a complimentary plate of fruit the rooms are true to the photos displayed on the website so you wont be in for any surprises but do bare in mind the rooms are not that large but are adequate for a few nights in london the hotel is near paddington underground and lancaster gate underground both stations are about minute walk from the hotel but just know that the lancaster gate station is currently closed till mid summer the area is quiet so you will not have any trouble sleeping you are in walking distance to many restaurants offering many different cuisines also hyde park is a minute walk away and oxford street can be reached by foot in about minutes one last benefit is that the hotel will store you luggage for you if your arrive early before check in and also store your luggage after check out if you are not leaving till later
