well the staff in general were very accommodating and well trained alice and adrian deserve some sort of recognition as they are so willing to help i just got off a flight from miami to torronto then torronto to london after working months on a cruise ship they were people who were genuinely helpful towards me and it was so nice to be looked after rather then looking after other people
