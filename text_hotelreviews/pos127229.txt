i loved the suit we got brought my boyfriend down for his birthday and paid upon arrival for nights in a club room the shower was amazing with a rainfall option from the roof and just normal shower option the bed was exceptionally comfortable was two singles together however didn t realise this until we were packing to come home wouldn t have known thought it was a queen size adjustable lights and tv with loads of channels even had a smart phone in the room if you couldn t get a network which helped you round london that you take with you it was brilliant oh and there was a safe too which was handy for passports etc
