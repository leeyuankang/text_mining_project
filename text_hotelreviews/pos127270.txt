excellent staff who are incredibly helpful and accommodating we had an issue at check in but richard was brilliant and not only solved our problem but added complementary breakfast he was also amazing again in helping us locate earplugs and was also pleasant and polite at check out the location is also so easy from paddington station is a straight shot of a maximum five minute walk would stay here again
