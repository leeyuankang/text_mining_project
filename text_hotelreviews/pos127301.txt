when we arrived the staff dealt with people as quickly as possible and showed you to your room which was nice because the hotel was rather big we also had a fridge and a microwave in our room which is handy to put a pint of milk in to chill the beds were nice and comfy and the shower was amazing it was basically a home from home the check in and out times were good as it meant you could relax in the morning without being forced out the door i would definitely stay here again such a nice experience we were a bit sceptical after the reviews but i am so glad we ignored them now
