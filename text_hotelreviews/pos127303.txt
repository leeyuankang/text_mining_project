we particularly liked roney the receptionist our room had nothing in common to the photos we saw whilst making the booking as if we made the reservation to a different hotel it was very small very old fashion not refurbished and we would not fit in the bathroom whilst the bed was tiny roney however did everything possible to give us another room and since the hotel was fully booked he made arrangements to move to another park grand hotel up the same road park grand london paddington he even arranged for a complimentary breakfast for all days of our stay which really set off for all the disappointment thank you roney p s basically my ratings go for the park grand london paddington hotel
