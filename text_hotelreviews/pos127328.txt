our bed in room was a super king sized bed and it was lovely very comfy the room was spotless specially the bathroom the room even had a microwave and fridge to very good location about minutes walk from paddington station staff were friendly even tho all were mostly foreign which might not please everyone but we didn t mind breakfast was good had everything you need the breakfast area was a little bit small so could be a problem when busy
