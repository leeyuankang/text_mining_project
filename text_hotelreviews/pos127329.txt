we stayed for nights it is a perfect location with tube stations and a train station very close by with access to many tube lines the staff were great and their facilities are very good the only thing is that the room is a bit small but it is well equipped with modern finish they also provided a free mobile with data internet access and free calls to the uk this was very helpful when we needed to refer to google maps for directions
