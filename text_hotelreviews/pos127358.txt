second time i stayed in this hotel clean hotel with fairly new rooms facilities beds great location very close to lancaster gate paddington station and to hyde park very kind staff we received a mobile phone from the hotel with internet to use for navigation in the city most of the guests during the week were there for business which also helps with it being a quiet hotel but definitely also a good hotel for leisure
