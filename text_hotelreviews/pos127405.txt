the location of this hotel is excellent it s only about a minute walk to from paddington train tube station depending on whether or not you are pulling luggage along but it s far enough away that it is in a quieter area it s very easy to find and there are a number of shops and restaurants close by the staff were lovely they were extremely knowledgeable very friendly and went out of their way to make sure my stay was pleasant they even carried my luggage to from my room for me and they arranged for a taxi for me from reception a couple of times the call system in the room was very helpful there were buttons along the wall to request service alert the cleaning staff that you were still in the room etc the air conditioning was a blessed relief as it was quite warm while i was there the room itself was very nice with a comfortable bed and a spacious shower the bar area was also a nice bonus as the olympics were on during my stay so i was able to sit and watch from time to time with a drink
