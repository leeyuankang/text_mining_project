the extra little touches like apples and water in the reception area which was so welcome when we arrived hungry and sweltering hot and had to wait until for our room to be ready the fruit tray wine and chocolates on the bed although we only got this on the day the way staff attempted to help us the location was great very close to the subway line a great little corner store minutes walk away and a lovely little cafe the craven cafe where we got a reasonable breakfast and wonderful home baked goods the cost of breakfast at the hotel was very high
