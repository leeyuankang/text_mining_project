the facilities in the room and not all hotels put toothbrush toothpaste but i found it in the bathroom i liked the quantity of the water cups and biscuits the staff was friendly and when i asked them for late checkout they gave me that without arguing the room is quite and have a very good size furniture they just need to put hand body lotion in the bathroom but wasn t really a big deal i like that there wasn t noise from children or noisy people
