as a solo traveller from australia this hotel was in a great location within easy walking access to paddington station but far enough away to allow for a peaceful rest quiet and quirky building with comfortable and modern features all the staff including the porters were friendly and couldn t do enough not a criticism but just to alert that whilst there is a lift it doesn t service all areas of the hotel due to the aforementioned quirky layout it didn t bother me especially as the porters do a sterling job of getting luggage to and from rooms
