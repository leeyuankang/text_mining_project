we stayed at this hotel for nights compact double room yes the room is small as expected but it was still quite comfortable for us and was very clean there are several shops and restaurants nearby which was very convenient the location was awesome very close to paddington station and an easy walking distance from the big bus tour stop as well overall had a very pleasant stay at this hotel
