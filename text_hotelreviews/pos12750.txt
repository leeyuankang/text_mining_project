this is the second time we have stayed here and consider its location excellent it is on the edge of bercy village and just a couple of hundred metres away from a metro stop making it easy to get around on this occasion we had travelled out to watch france v england at le stade we were upgraded on arrival from superior to deluxe which was obviously appreciated although i m not certain how the rooms differed other than the free soft drinks mini bar the room was light spacious and spotlessly clean and the large bed afforded us two extremely comfortable nights sleep we managed to secure a deal with breakfast included which obviously made it better value choices available are extensive so i defy anyone to not find something that appeals
