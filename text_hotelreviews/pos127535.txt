my boyfriend i stayed here for nights while visiting london i would highly recommend staying at the grand paddington for many reasons the neighborhood is great we were able to walk to knotting hill hyde park the paddington train station also to a couple nice restaurants an amazing italian restaurant bizarro just a block or away the other is the swan for awesome meat pies fish chips the shower was great bed was very comfortable the room was decorated beautifully also it was nice having a coffee machine mini fridge hair dryer in room the smart phone was amazingly helpful too since we are not from the uk one morning we had the breakfast downstairs it was really good we would definetely stay again if we come back to london
