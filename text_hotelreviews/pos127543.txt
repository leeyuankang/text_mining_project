excellent location nice area good little shops nearby very close to lancaster gate tube staff were friendly and helpful nice touches in the room like the android smart phone that could be used for local calls and internet access good facilities in the room microwave kettle fridge etc the shower had a choice of ceiling spray or normal shower head which was great for me as i am tall and i have to stoop under most showers not here though
