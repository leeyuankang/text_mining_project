staff s attitude to provide good services from reception counter to concierge or the maids on may i went to check into the hotel as a call of my stay call was may and i was told that there were double booking with booking com i didn t realize that and asked the reception staff to cancel one for me michael contacted his colleague in other department and told me i had to contact booking com directly since the booking was made there before i could call booking com the guy at the concierge his name is difficult to pronounce proposed to take care of my luggage and gave me a glass of water and told me that everything would be attended and fine this is very good service to comfort your guest he moved me to the business centre room next door where i was able to make a phone call to booking com i informed booking com over phone of my situation and how i by mistake made my own booking twice staff verified the situation and got back to me with email confirming that one of the booking was cancelled without charges this took only minutes of the handling and i was happy with their efficient action later i was able to check in and even got upgrade to the club room after i got into my room michale made a follow up call to see if everything went ok in my room how impressive in the evening on the day of my check out may i was dragging my luggage by myself i didn t call staff since it s just on the same floor but then there were few steps of stairs to make and the maid who saw me dragging my big luggage came to help pushing my bag i was surprised to see how staff was attentive to assist their guest over all i surely will recommend this hotel to the others and i will come back to stay there in the future
