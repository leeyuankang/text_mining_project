it is the second time i have stayed here in the last month and again i can not fault my stay staff are so friendly and hopeful and nothing is to much to ask very clean and well presented room excellent location central but quiet perfect to unwind after a busy day shopping site seeing looking forward to returning end of may for a business trip
