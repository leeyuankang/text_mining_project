overall location was very convenient as it is walking distance from different metro lines brown green yellow and red neighborhood is very safe and quite generally speaking the hotel has new modern facilities bathroom bed furniture outside the hotel there are renting bicycles which you can use leave all over london as the hotel is close to hyde park if the weather is nice you can have a easy look around there are buttons in the room that you can indicate if you are sleeping not to be bothered and if you need cleaning service breakfast was ok a bit of everything
