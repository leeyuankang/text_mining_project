the hotel was easy to find and only a minute walk from the lancaster gate tube station only taking minutes by tube to get you to oxford street bond street and minutes away from westfield shopping cerntre by tube so it really does have a good location minutes walk over to hyde park near the lake side which is nice the customer service was great too they offered any help with whatever we needed and also made it that little bit extra special in the room with an upgrade too as it was my birthday very lucky amazing value for money is the best thing for two nights is basically the price of one in a night so great hotel couldn t really fault it for the price
