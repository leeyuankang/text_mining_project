the hotel is very well located and still in a quiet street it s is very clean and the staff was very kind and accommodating to the only request we made highly appreciated i stayed there with my toddler and it was just perfect i will definetely book there again for our next london trip we enjoyed our stay in nadler the complimentary nespresso in our room was the cherry on top of the cake the wifi is also very good and hassle free
