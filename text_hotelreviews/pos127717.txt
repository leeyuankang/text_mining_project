this hotel is a real gem and for zone in london utterly astonishing for the price i was greeted by smiling and very welcoming staff and upgraded on check in the room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable with the bonus of an empty fridge the bar was a pleasant place to relax the hotel is a minute walk from paddington station and is in a quiet location for the area with plenty of local shops and restaurants within seconds i didn t eat breakfast there so i can t comment on that i suspect though given the excellent standard of the hotel that i would have been more than satisfied it was an absolute pleasure to stay there
