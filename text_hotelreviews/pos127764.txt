fantastic location quick and easy to find your way from and to paddington station perfect for a short stay very friendly staff the twin room was rather small but comfortable enough with very soft beds the architecture of the building is intriguing we spent several fun minutes just going up and down the puzzling stairs trying to figure out the lay of the building
