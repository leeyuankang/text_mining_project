the room was amazing the staff was great the first person you meet is the door person and a smile immediately puts the nervous tourist in you at ease excellent location if you miss breakfast there are some great little places nearby to get a coffee and croissant take away walking distance to pret if you re really hungry hyde park is a stones throw away nice quiet and very nice location paddington station is also a short walk and it s not as bustling and intense as st pancras this hotel was perfect my first night in london as i was exhausted and jet lagged it was cold and rainy so i stayed put in the room and enjoyed the one night i stayed to the max
