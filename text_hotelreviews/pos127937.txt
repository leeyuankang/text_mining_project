perfect hotel for a business traveller like me the hotel is located a few minutes walk from paddington station where there is shuttle to heathrow airport and close to hyde park where i love jogging the staff was polite and helpful the room was very quiet clean and had all necessary equipment including a good wifi connection and you have shops and restaurants nearby
