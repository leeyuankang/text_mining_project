we booked this hotel when we stayed overnight in london on our wedding anniversary the hotel was not aware of this in advance but it was mentioned when we were checking in the reception staff were brilliant we were upgraded to a club room the room was decorated with flower petals and bath towels folded like love swans and we had complimentary wine fruit and cake it could not have been better
