hotel is close to paddington station and offers fairly good value the hotel is relatively clean and the beds are comfortable the single rooms are a decent size and provide some space for you to store your luggage the fitness was ok and had working equipment the bathroom was a decent size and the shower pressure worked quite well and the rooms seemed fairly well insulated as sound did not seem to travel that much between rooms
