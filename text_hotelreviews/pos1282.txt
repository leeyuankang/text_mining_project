the location is excellent midway between the west end and st paul s the hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto fleet st and the hustle and bustle of the city of london staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful
