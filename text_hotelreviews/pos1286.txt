this is an amazing hotel we first went in jan for a six night break and loved it so much that we went in jan for five nights the staff are very helpful and there are always plenty around the location is fantastic just a few minutes walk to the strand and about mins to oxford street the rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the wifi works well and allows multiple devices to be logged on we like this hotel so much that we are now thinking about one of the apex edinburgh hotels for the end of feb
