the hotel was so beautiful and the staff so helpful i went with my boyfriend for his birthday and we got a bottle of cava on arrival and another on his actual birthday it was such a sweet thought and absolutely wonderful to receive the staff were so friendly and the concierge very useful we used them for all of our recommendations and it definitely paid off the pool is gorgeous and rooms so luxurious and modern i loved the usb ports next to the bed and the beds were super comfortable i would go back in a heartbeat already planning my next trip an unforgettable stay
