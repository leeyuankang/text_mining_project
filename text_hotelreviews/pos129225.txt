amazing place the room was finished to the highest standard and facilities were super modern very impressive the spa gym in the basement and pool on the roof were beautifully finished and a good size especially being in the centre of barcelona the breakfast was probably the best i have had and they catered to our requests happily last but not least the staff were brilliant and their recommendations were fantastic it made our engagement weekend even more memorable
