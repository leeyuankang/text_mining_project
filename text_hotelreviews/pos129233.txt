this is a brand new contemporary hotel that my wife and i thought was outstanding bed was truly king sized and perfect all of the people we interacted with were exceptionally gracious and helpful we only stayed one night after a cruise before heading back to the us so we ate breakfast and dinner there food was excellent although if you order an omelette instruct them to put the vegetables and cheese inside the omelette rather than on the side
