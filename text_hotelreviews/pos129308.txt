lovely small cozy hotel very comfortable and quiet with an excellent cocktail bar if you re looking for something different staff were very helpful and friendly breakfast good although eggs were overcooked location is great and we were lucky enough to get a discount for the room so it was also good value we felt very at home and i would definitely stay here again
