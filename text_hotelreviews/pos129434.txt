we loved the fact that hotel was located right next to the science museum we took our kids there before our tour of paris museum is full of interesting and interactive things for kids to do good choice of places to eat just across the street from the hotel and mcdonalds right next to it for morning coffee run serving good quality coffee hotel restaurant was also very good we had our dinner there on our second night we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality hotel at a decent price
