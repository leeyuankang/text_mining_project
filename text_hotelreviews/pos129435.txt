the room was fantastic very spacious and had a mini bar along with free wifi the hotel is situated only a minute walk from the metro which will bring you into the champs elysees in about mins there is a couple of nice restaurants across the street which are affordable and have good food if the weather is nice you should you take a stroll towards stalingrad or grab the metro if you re not feeling the walk and have a drink in la rotund all in all a great hotel which made our stay in paris all the more enjoyable
