i recommend this hotel i saw star hotels that did not look as good as forest hill the rooms are like those on site very clean and tidy when i saw the hotel location on the map i thought it was quite far from the center but in fact you can easily reach the city center by metro which is in front of the hotel malicious comments have nothing to do with reality thanks forest hill
