the hotel was clean and well put together the staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to make dinner reservations for us and to make recommendations the location was good for us with some interesting restaurants and cafes in the local area and an easy train ride into the centre of paris we have been to paris many times so being in the arr was not critical for us
