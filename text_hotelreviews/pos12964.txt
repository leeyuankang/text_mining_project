it was a very pleasant stay here the room we got was very clean and modern we had a little balcony floor which was very nice you can darken the room very well the bathroom was spacious very rare for paris the elevator though was very very small but i think this is rather a detail the staff was very helpfull and friendly you can leave your luggage in the hotel as you checkout and you still want to discover paris we didn t took the breakfast at the hotel the hotel is located in a very good neighbourhood of paris the distance to the nearest metrostation is not close but nor far either you have a little supermarket in the neighbourhood this hotel is recommended
