we stayed at the tophams at the end of august upon arrival the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful when asked staff were very accommodating bringing us hot chocolates to the room and extra pillows we could tell the staff really care about their guests although the room was quite small it was perfect and exactly as described not to mention the great location we had a fantastic stay and will most definitely be staying here again
