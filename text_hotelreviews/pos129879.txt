all the staff were very helpful the room was delightful the location was superb whilst the courtyard garden was as pretty as a picture min walk to opera bastille not far from notre dame de paris and other tourist attractions very good selection of restaurants and cafes around definitely recommend the hotel to those looking for a quiet place in the centre of paris for luxury holidays
