the staff was our favorite part of the experience this was our first trip to paris and they were incredibly accommodating and kind we loved the breakfast in the front study it was pricey but we got our monies worth the bellmen and front desk were amazing perfect location for a short or long stay we loved paris more than we expected for our time and this was the perfect spot to get that feeling i think many look for when coming to paris thank you all
