i loved everything about the hotel starting from the welcoming greetings at arrival cozy property located in a cozy place quiet and friendly good spa and fitness facilities very friendly and helpful staff min walk to opera bastille not far from notre dame de paris and other tourist attractions very good selection of restaurants and cafes around definately recommend the hotel to those looking for a quiet place in the centre of paris for luxury holidays
