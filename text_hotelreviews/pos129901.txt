this hotel is quiet private and chic if you like the feeling of privacy in a beautiful place and a cool neighborhood this is the hotel for you this is not one of those grand hotels and so the hallways are a bit too narrow and some of the rooms are not as great as others i think this all adds to the charm of the place and the sense of history the staff was friendly and helpful even the ladies who cleaned the rooms were sweet don t miss out on having breakfast in the beautiful rooms downstairs really a treat this was our time there and we were upgraded to a family suite which was a wonderful surprise we were and had bedrooms a living room and bathrooms it was for us a very memorable stay
