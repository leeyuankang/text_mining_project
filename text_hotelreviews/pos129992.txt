we had requested an early check in due to an very early flight and though it wasn t available the staff could not have been more charming or helpful arianne on the front desk deserves a special mention local restaurant recommendations were perfect small but very well designed room great shower excellent continental breakfast would definitely return wonderful location central but not touristy
