we had the most amazing time at this lovely boutique hotel as it s name suggests it is located off the main streets and is very quiet despite being within walking distance to almost every tourist destination within central paris the hotel itself is beautiful the rooms truly are like the pictures the staff were wonderful and took us on a tour of the facilities when we arrived breakfast although a little expensive was incredible honestly don t miss out we will definitely be back and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough
