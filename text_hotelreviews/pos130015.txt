we was greeted by lovely friendly staff who made us feel at home right away they carried our suitcases to our room and right asked us if we had any plans organised for new years eve as reservations we re running low in all restaurants and wanted to make sure we got the most out of our stay whilst we went out one day they spent the afternoon recommending and calling restaurants for us trying to get us a table for the night tanya was absolutely brilliant and the restaurant we ended up going to was amazing the rooms are small and cosy but absolutely spotless and stylish the hotel is located brilliantly in paris with only a short walkaway from the metro we are already thinking about coming back to this hotel in the summer as we loved our days in paris thank you to all the staff for making our new years eve the best ever
