the staff very friendly and easy to approach we booked two rooms and travelled with small baby and the lady at the reception was so kind to allocate us and my parents on the same floor she saw us coming with the baby stroller and accommodate us in a bigger corner room with more space i would definitely recommend that hotel if you are visiting paris with a small baby the hotel rooms are really quiet and no noise from the street or neighbouring rooms there is also a lift very tiny but that s paris so you should be happy to have one at all lovely quiet street overlooking the park nice design very clean probably min walk from the nearest metro station but we used it once as we walked pretty much everywhere very comfortable bed location is good if you not looking for a very busy part of paris but close to bastille or nation if i would be visiting paris again i would book that hotel for sure again wifi really good my parents had much smaller room but with a sofa their toilet was much smaller and the only comment from my dad was that if there would be bigger person than it would be quiet difficult for them to turn around in that toilet or get into shower but hey it s paris and we liked the place and we fitted in the toilet lol
