the room was very comfortable and had a great view of the city on the floor we also received a complimentary bottle of champagne as the visit to london was for my partner s birthday we didnt eat at the hotel but we made use of the fitness room although it was small it offered the basic equipment to be able to have a well rounded workout the rooftop bar on floor was fantastic although we had to wait minutes for our drink to be made and brought over to us
