had a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival for the two of us the rooms were the right size and beautifully decorated the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very clean with a great shower a really great location as it s about a minute walk to waterloo tube station and it s very close to the old vic theatre if you fancy going to see a play
