very nice contemporary room on floor bit different to the standard hotel decor corner room with lots of light from dual aspect windows but good curtains for light blocking at night not huge room but very good size for london didn t have the feel of a big hotel in a good way felt calm but busy enough comfy bed no noise from outside or hotel at night looked like a lovely roof terrace but didn t have time to try it didn t use restaurant but looked very nice too
