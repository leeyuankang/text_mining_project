the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were very friendly complimentary drink at check in which was welcomed as it must have been pushing degrees great location close to most attractions but not in an overly busy location only thing i would question is if they could keep the outside sky bar open later as the views are spectacular and its a very enjoyable place to sit
