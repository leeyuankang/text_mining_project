the rooftop bar was great with a great selection of drinks especially gin which is their specialty there was a massive choice of breakfast goodies both hot and cold the location is fantastic just what we were after to access the old vic the room had a good coffee maker although no instructions nice view and a clean and well stocked bathroom friendly staff good facilities and reasonably priced
