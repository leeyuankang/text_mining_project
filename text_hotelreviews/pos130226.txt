the bed was marvellously large and comfortable the bathroom was sparkling and efficient we liked having a view over london rooftops and famous sights we have stayed twice in order to attend concerts at the festival hall which is minutes walk away ideal it would not be very convenient for the west end however it is possible to find up to a dozen reasonable and varies places to eat within the same minute walk we didn t try the hotel restaurant feeling it was likely to be pricey
