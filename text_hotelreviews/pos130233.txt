the staff were outstanding very helpful and very polite we received a very warm welcoming from the reception and exceptional service and delicious cocktails from the bar with amazing views of the city and the london eye we really appreciate the champagne and cake that was placed in our fresh very clean room for my boyfriends birthday we made a few requests and all requests were done with perfection it was a lovely stay and we would definitely return and recommend it to others as it s not too pricey and well worth it
