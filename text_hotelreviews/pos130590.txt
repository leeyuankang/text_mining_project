this hotel is fantastic it is in a quiet chelsea neighborhood and a short walk from the sloane square tube station our room was split level so we weren t tripping over our luggage and it seemed very spacious the best part was the wonderful staff they really make it a homey place and were always asking if there was anything we needed we had the continental breakfast included in the rate which was a lovely basket of croissants and rolls with coffee and juice
