the drinking water was amazing pure italian drinking mater the molton brown ammenities were amazing the place give you a feeling of being isolated the rooms are contested and so is the bathroom the shower is not ideal and while taking shower the space is way conjested if you are a couple it might have an advantage because the bed looks like one of those wedding beds the view from window is average as you are having only residential buildings around the door keys are typical keys and you have to drop the key before you leave the accommodation it s some security standard the hotel has the tv screen in room is normal computer screen with two remotes to be used and is way smaller the internet is good
