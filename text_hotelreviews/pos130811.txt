the veggie breakfast was lovely and lots of it served hot which is always a bonus ample room on the floor we didn t mind claiming the stairs the bathroom was small but very modern and clean they need to put a hook on the door as there wasn t anywhere to hang your towel a very convenient one night stay in a central location
