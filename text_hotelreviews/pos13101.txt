the staff was friendly and helpful when making a booking i added a couple of special requests the room to face away from the street and have twin beds when we checked in both requests have been ignored although the concierge could see them in his system so next day after my complaining they readily moved us to another room which again did not satisfy either of the two criteria but was now on the top floor higher up above the street noise go figure i really apreciate the advise i got ftom mohammad to be at the airport earlier it turned out that indeed the lines and the wait at cdg were horrendous there is an ajacent restaurant that serves fine complementary breakfast the staff there is also very friendly for other meals prices are a bit too high for the value another plus is that this hotel is a long walk await from montmartre the beds were very comfortable
