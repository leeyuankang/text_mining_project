i really liked my single room it was very tiny but had everything in it was comfortable and clean i loved the bed next to the window had a cup of coffee while people watching in the morning it was great the location is very handy close enough the bus and metro stations and right in the corner to the british museum they also allow guests to leave their luggage in the reception to pick it up later after checkout
