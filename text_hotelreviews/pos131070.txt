excellent location with easy access to euston station and two underground stations goodge street and russell square free wi fi tv and tea and coffee making facilities provided the room was clean with fresh towels provided every day and the beds made we would definitely stay at this hotel again the location and price could not be faulted if the few negatives were addressed i would have given each part of my review as excellent
