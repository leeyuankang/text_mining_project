great location nice small hotel we found goodge street was the nearest tube station just round the corner price included breakfast which was very nice our room was lower ground was a bit worried but pleasantly surprised when opened the door woke up at to hear breakfast being prepped as our room was between the kitchen and dining room overall really liked the hotel they even let us leave our case after checking out for a few hours completely recommend
