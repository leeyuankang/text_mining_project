arrived early and able to check into room straight away staff were friendly and approachable great location minute walk from euston station and a minute walk to the prince edward theatre tea and coffee facilities in the room was a nice bonus for an overnight stay it is ideal and particularly if you want to be within walking distance of tottenham court road and the west end
