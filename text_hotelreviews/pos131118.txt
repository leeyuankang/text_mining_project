great value very easy fuss free reception good breakfast included small room but plenty big enough for what i needed good selection of complimentary toiletries two small bottles of mineral water provided and much appreciated very clean very nice shower bed was very comfy with plenty of pillows i stayed here because the local premier inn was full but i think i prefer this hotel certainly i ll be staying here again when i have an early morning meeting in the city i also booked a single room but got a double which was a bonus
