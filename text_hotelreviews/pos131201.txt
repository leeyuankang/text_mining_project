after reading mixed reviews on here i am unsure what others were expecting an think some reviews are extremely unfair yes it was my personal view but for london and the central area the hotel is located and for the price well i was expecting less than what i got if i am honest i have stayed in some terrible hotels in the past in london but i give this one an everything really was superb staff room facilities location breakfast all i had no complaints at all if i had a problem it was dealt with efficiently and promptly and actually looking back the only problem i had was with the sofa bed the staff had kindly put out and made up in my room and i needed it taken down and well i struggled tadeusz the lovely maintenance guy was more than happy to help he ad only knocked to see if everything was okay i decided to take myself to london as a belated birthday treat to see dickens museum and the museum of london crime museum uncovered kamila was there on arrival greeted me with a big smile welcomed me let me freshen up as i was early and wanted to go out to a museum gave me a map of the area and directions being a single traveller and a woman on my own and not having travelled on my own for years kamila had offered any problems whilst out to call the hotel that gave me such confidence when check in came kamila asked how the museum was and generally was interested i went and checked in my room was lovely big t v massive arm chair which was a sofa bed if required bathroom and shower had two settings was great and clean wardrobe plenty of hangers space and a safe which was peace of mind to leave lots in my room tea and coffee facilities and my room looked onto a court yard was lovely with birds and peaceful for where the hotel was located
