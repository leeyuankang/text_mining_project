after reading the reviews i was a bit worried going to the hotel but i was pleasantly shocked when i arrived the hotel was great i am actually surprised about all the negative comments i personally can t fault it i guess most people who disliked it never been to properly shabby hotels yes the room is small but well decorated comfortable newly refurbished and clean and there is definitely space for the suitcase i didn t have any smell in my room either the bathroom was clean and towels changed daily rooms had wifi and flat screen tv with plenty of channels full english breakfast although i wish they served porridge too but the best bit is certainly location just min walk from the tube goodge street and walking distance to covent garden or oxford street min or euston sq min a couple of restaurants and tesco metro nearby too overall i m extremely pleased with the facilities and value for money
