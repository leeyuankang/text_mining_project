location is fantastic surrounded by grocery stores fabulous patisserie round the corner subway lines and even a famous french bistro chartier the room is beautifully decorated in art deco style and the bed is comfortable eventhough it is located in a busy intersection the windows are sound proof its great to just look out the balcony and watch the world go by staff are friendly helpful and respond well to feedback and requests
