having read recent reviews i was not looking forward to staying at this hotel but i stayed in and was visiting london with a gf this was a triple room in a basement the room had a double bed room a sitting bedroom with single sofa bed and shower room having spoken to other guests we were lucky the rooms upstairs were very very small so what was good breakfast room clean and location great would i stay again yes but perhaps not upstairs
