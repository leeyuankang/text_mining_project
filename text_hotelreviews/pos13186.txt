bed was very comfy the continental breakfast was good especially the croissants the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the location is spot on right in the centre of paris with easy access to metro rail stations which makes seeing all of paris easy several busy cafes bars in a busy pedestrian street however the double glazed windows really do shut it all out making the room really quiet we were on the floor facing busy cafes
