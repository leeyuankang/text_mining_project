the room was beautiful and unique the staff was incredibly friendly helpful and responsive and helped make numerous arrangements before and during our stay the hotel was perfectly located but very quiet it had all the convenience of a hotel but felt like staying in your own private hideaway surrounded by great restaurants boutiques and cafes i would definitely stay there again
