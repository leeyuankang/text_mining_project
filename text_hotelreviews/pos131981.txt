we enjoyed our stay so much that we actually changed our flights to book an additional night the bed is really comfortable we loved the big clawfoot tub the quirky designs of the two rooms we had were fun and the location is excellent just a stone s throw from loads of small galleries bars caf s and restaurants and just minutes from the picasso museum the staff are professional discreet and efficient we would certainly book here again and in fact we have already done so
