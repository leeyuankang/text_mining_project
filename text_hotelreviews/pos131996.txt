very friendly hotel the girls on the front desk were very helpful and polite the room was beautifully decorated and the ceiling completely mirrored we only stayed one night as on way down to nice so didn t try all facilities but what we did try was excellent the car was also safe in their underground carpark would definitely stay there again
