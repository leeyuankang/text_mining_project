hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid hopefully you take the feedback on board would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics right
