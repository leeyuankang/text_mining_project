this hotel is elegant intimate and very french the location is charming with parisian cafes and restaurants around the corner but also access to practical things like the subway stops and a few grocery stores located within walking distance the hotel also has a nice staff and they did a good job overall my room was chic sunny and intimate not that small with a window opening out and a rather roomy bathroom hotel restaurant appeared nice but i did not dine there much the petite breakfast which i had once was fine croissants flaky and coffee fine nothing great
