stayed at junior suite floor nothing beats the view to eiffel from the room you see the beautiful night tower and wake up with perfect paris setting outside your room just breathtaking room itself was very spacious elegant modern extremely clean and super cozy attic ceiling and lighting bathroom is superb the tub super comfy and could probably fit people in it despite the location on the intersection room was very quiet unless you decide to use the bluetooth speaker in the room location is perfect for eiffel and public transport connections to everything staff was very friendly and helpful will definitely come back
