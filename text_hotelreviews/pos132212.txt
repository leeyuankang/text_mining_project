the staff at the front desk were incredibly nice and cooperative they provided us with more than one adapter when requested and allowed for a late checkout free of charge to compensate the first night we missed due to the bad weather conditions coming in to paris also our room was clean and ready upon the next day early in the morning location was excellent just minutes walk to the eiffle tower supermarket and restaurants surrounding the area close by the hotel
