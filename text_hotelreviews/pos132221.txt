we were in paris for our honeymoon and hotel la comtesse was just lovely the hotel is in a lovely neighborhood near the eiffel tower the staff was friendly the room was warm and amazingly quite amazing since it was on a rather big busy street it is also in very close proximity of the metro station so it was perfect for getting around in paris it was never too far away from where you d like to see as first timers in paris as we on our day i got sick and the staff at the reception got me a nice english speaking doctor very quick early in the morning would definatelty stay again and recommend oh and we had a balcony and could sit across the eiffel tower
