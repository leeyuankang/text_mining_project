surprisingly convient location in that public transportation is immediately at hand and certain of the must see locations are within walking distance the hotel is like a well run ship whose internal architecture condensed the hall space from the elevator in order to give the rooms much more space to hold a large bed and a large bathroom shower and bath tub very nicely appointed room with sufficient electric sockets and wifi breakfast was excellent though not inexpensive for paris it was still good value for what i paid i would stay here again and if it did not rain i d sit out on the tiny balcony and watch the eiffel tower at night
