the hotel is in a perfect location around the corner from the metro and plenty of lovely cafes restaurants and a supermarket within walking distance of the eiffel tower the army museum and several other attractions the room was perfect for our needs plenty of storage super comfy beds air conditioning safe tea coffee and a mini bar the bathroom was beautiful and clean and came with all the necessities and loads of towels the wi fi was excellent too i really enjoyed my stay here and would without a doubt stay here again it was safe ideally located in the city but still quiet at night the staff were also extremely helpful and friendly we never tried the restaurant here but i image that was just as good as the rest of the hotel
