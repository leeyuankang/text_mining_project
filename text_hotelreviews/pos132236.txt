the location was amazing being only minutes walking distance from the eiffel tower the staff were very helpful letting us borrow an adapter after ours didn t fit they even let us get changed when leaving our bags early because we arrived hours before check in they never said no to anything and were very friendly the room was beautiful clean and very modern
