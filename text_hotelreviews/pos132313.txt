the free fruit pastries and soda bar at the lobby was awesome nice thing to get something to drink and eat after running around the city all day the bed was probably the best hotel bed i have slept in years so comfortable our room had a balcony and free minifridge that was filled with soft drinks daily it was so nice to sit at the balcony with a cold drink before going to bed
