we stayed with our seven year old daughter in a privilege room which had a sliding door to separate the areas meaning we could put her to bed sofa bed and stay up to watch tv or read it was like having a two bedroom apartment in the centre of paris the hotel was lovely and in a fantastic location close to the metro which made it easy to get to disneyland and all the local sights and shopping right in the doorstep my daughter loved that it was just across the street from laduree too so it made it really easy for a macaron fix this was my second stay here and it will not be our last
