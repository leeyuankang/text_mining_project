area was great very close to good restaurants grocery shops and cafes vibrant area but the room was quiet top floor room had a balcony with table and chairs which was a nice bonus and actually made the room feel bigger i feel the price of the hotel considering the rest of paris was very fair restaurant in the hotel does amazing food but was a bit pricy enough although all of paris is pricy so i m being over critical there it was all awesome
