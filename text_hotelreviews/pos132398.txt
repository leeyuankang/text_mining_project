this is one of my favorite hotels it s trendy but not too trendy and the rooms are all great the beds are so comfy there s a nice bar downstairs which is great for a wine in the evening and meeting new people always many interesting characters here from creative businesses the pigalle area is super cool with nice cafes and lovely shops it s less crowded than the centre which is why i like it
