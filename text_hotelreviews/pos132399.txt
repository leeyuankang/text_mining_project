this hotel was fantastic a real little boutique hotel great bar restaurant breakfast area our room was very small but the d cor was really nice bathroom fine the staff were all really helpful a young competent team great bars and restaurants nearby a bit tricky to get to the river and the tourist hotspots if you don t plan in advance
