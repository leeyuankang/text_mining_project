we arrived at this super cute boutique hotel in an area we did not explore the last time we were in paris the location was great and the area generally felt like a locals area which was a nice change since we stayed in le marais last time the front desk staff was extremely helpful and our hotel room was ready hours earlier this was fantastic since we had an early flight from barcelona and wanted to freshen up before we went out for the day they handed us a very cute key with a leather tassel and we headed for our room which the staff said was the best room we had the corner unit with a large bathroom on the top floor we had a cute little seating area pictures included the beds were comfortable and had a little sweet treat on each pillow the room was very clean and had a coffee machine and a very nice mini bar fridge the selection was superb all high end more rare type of stuff that you typically do not see in hotel mini fridges the room had so many windows and great views of sacre coure the location was really awesome the more we explored the neighborhood we used yelp to help us find some restaurants and chose one nearby that was perfect it was walking distance to the hotel and the bread came from the bakery right next door to our hotel turns out our server at the restaurant recommended us to go to the bakery next to our hotel because it s his mom s bakery we went the next day and bought so much all of it was extremely delicious get the waffle anyway there are several restaurants and great shops in this area and on the same street as the hotel it is great to walk around an explore without the crowds of le marais the bar at the hotel is also fantastic they had a great selection the bartender was super nice and he made great cocktails based on a liquor we wanted they had mezcal there which surprised me as i haven t found much in europe he made a great citrusy and spicy cocktail
