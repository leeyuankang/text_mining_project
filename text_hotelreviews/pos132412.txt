this was my second stay at the grande pigalle for the second leg of my holiday i was a little worried because my first stay was in a superior room but all fears were laid to rest smaller rooms are still beautiful and clean and i got a balcony as requested this hotel definitely helps to set a parisian tone with it s decor and architecture
