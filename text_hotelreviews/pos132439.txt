great location comfortable beds good atmosphere in hotel and locally really friendly and helpful staff would recommend ito izakaya japanese tapas round the corner and tea folies on rue henry monnier easy walk to sacre coeur and dali museum via funicular and also moulin rouge and metro for everywhere else area around hotel is lovely but be aware that around moulin rouge has more adult themes my children and were unfazed by it all
