booked the grand pigalle room for my wife s birthday trip i would advise if you have the extra money to stretch to this pull the trigger it s a classy room not massive but big by paris standards on the floor has a balcony and felt a little like wes anderson had a hand in the decor clearly a bonus particularly like the cocktail glass carpetted hallways and gold pineapples on the doors all in all a very nice boutique hotel in a good location not far from the sacre couer staff were very warm and helpful and not at all judgemental of our frankly horrendous attempt at speaking french
