enjoyed our stay at the inn so much we changed our plans and went back for two more nights for the last remaining part of our trip the pub on main floor is marvellous the building is historic and has got loads of character the decor atmosphere in pub is really nice quirky interesting and comfy there are three main eating drinking social areas two of which are outdoors we really loved it staff is wonderful very friendly kind and accommodating another great thing about this place is the location in greenwich it is close to everything the awesome markets are within a stone s throw and many shops and restaurants can be found in the immediate vicinity the thames waterfront cutty sark and the clipper boats that one can catch to ride up and down river to various sights important historic sites points of interest is a very short and pleasant walk from the innkeepers lodge mitre we got to the innkeeper s lodge greenwich by taking the train from gatwick airport to new cross gate then hiring a taxi for the relatively short ride from the station to the hotel fantastic
