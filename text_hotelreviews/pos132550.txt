the twin room was nothing special but it wasn t cramped and it was clean and tidy the buffet breakfast was very nice with plenty on offer the rooms whilst over a pub with live music didn t suffer from a lot of noise which was great the staff were friendly and helpful they let us leave bags as we were early for check in and also on leaving day when we wanted to wander unencumbered for a few hours before our train the position of the pub was great a minute walk to the dlr and all the great sites in greenwich
