the mitre pub innkeepers lodge is situated close to all local amenities street parking or the ibis hotel opposite you can use on a first come first basis and charge for hours the accommodation it s self is lovely and d cor is very interesting with lots of different clocks it s in greenwich after all so very apt we stayed in room for just one night because of work and i would say that this was probably the smallest but it was well equipped with soaps and shampoos teas and coffee with views of the high street and each window dressed with lovely flower boxes the staff are very friendly and the food was very good i would stay again and would recommend to friends and family
