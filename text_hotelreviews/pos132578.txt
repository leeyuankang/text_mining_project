the property is fine but finding it is a problem as booking com call it the inn keeper s lodge but the is no sign that says that outside the property it is infact called the mitre a pub fortunately i had the address with me the picture wasn t great but i was able to finally find it however i would like to recommend that somewhere on the listing of this bed and breakfast it is also called the mitre then it is easier to find its a great location
