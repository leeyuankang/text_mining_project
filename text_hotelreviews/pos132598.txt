this is london so we are always going to pay over the odds for hotels however for a change this hotel has lovely sized rooms i ended up with a family room due to late booking but the room was massive if you stayed in here with kids they had loads of running around space the bathroom and toilet separate were both updated and clean the staff were super friendly from check in to leaving breakfast was ok for me cereals hot flaky croissants juice fruit proper coffee etc and i took it to my room to have while getting ready with no problem i noticed people eating on the afternoon of arrival and the food looked good although i didn t partake the hotel is a few minutes walk to the tube and there is a good variety of shops around
