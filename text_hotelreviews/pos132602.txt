location excellent and price reasonable the room was basic but clean and quiet so no complaints saturday was live music night so beware if you plan on turning in early however it finished pretty much on time and the noise went away completely this is a pub after all so we didn t see this as a problem in fact i thought it was well managed the hotel is very close to the centre of greenwich so restaurants transport and attractions are very easy to walk to arena is a minute bus ride away but most of the other attractions are only a short walk away
