we really enjoyed our stay at the mitre the staff were very kind and helpful breakfast was just right they served toast fruit croissants cereal juice tea milk coffee etc they also offered pub meals we had drinks and dinner there the last night and they were really worth it the area makes a change from the crowded noisy centre of london with a minute walk away from the cutty sark dlr station they also allowed us to keep our luggage there when we checked out so we could make the most of the morning before heading towards the airport i would definitely repeat our next stay here
