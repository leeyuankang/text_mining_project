the staff were excellent very friendly and helpful the hotel has lots of character and history and as fortunately not been over modernised and ruined the beds are comfortable and the rooms clean the continental breakfast included was also good the location is great for all the sites in greenwich and close to public transport links into london will definitely visit again
