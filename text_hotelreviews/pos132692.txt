we were there for a very sad occasion but the warm greeting of the staff and helpful upbeat attitude was lovely the location would be really good if you were on a mini break and sightseeing we know the area well and it is also great for restaurants etc it is a busy area at night so you must expect some noise the beds are comfy the rooms very clean with all the standard facilities and we loved the breakfast which we were able to eat outside because of the lovely weather that day a very comprehensive continental buffet including great croissants and excellent coffee thank you for making a sad return to london a little sweeter
