great location in greenwich room wasn t large but was clean and comfortable shower worked well asked for a quieter room got one towards the back still a bit of road noise but that was to be expected since its right on one of the busy streets in greenwich was there in mid june with nice temperatures so had window open put some ear plugs in and slept fine probably would be quieter in winter great view of st alfage s church next door there is a lift for those who don t want to take the stairs breakfast was decent nice breakfast room in the back of the pub within easy walking distance of sights in greenwich a few blocks from tube stop
