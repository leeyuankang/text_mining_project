firstly the location was ideal both the dlr station and river bus pier were within easy walking distance the hotel was also close enough to london city which was easily and quickly accessible we were attending a concert at the and the river bus before and after took only minutes the hotel itself is years old but well maintained and comfortable the room was clean tidy and modern but retained some of the old features the staff were extremely nice and helpful
