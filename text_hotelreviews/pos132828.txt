great location in the center of greenwich some minutes walk to the museums the royal observatory cutty sark the underground clean room and bathroom sheets etc changed every day quiet at least on the third floor third floor is the highest one and there is a lift there is a note in front saying this is a historic building and even some mention is made of unesco but we failed to understand what exactly the case was it would be nice to have more and better information a good pub on the first floor where they offer you continental breakfast in the morning acceptable staff polite but not too enthusiastic
