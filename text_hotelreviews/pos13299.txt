scribe staff in general at reception and the concierge and cleaners were excellent but the lumiere staff were sloppy and inefficient and did not reflect a star hotel status the scribe hotel also made a lovely gesture for my husband s birthday with desserts and an upgrade to a beautiful suite which was superb the bed was wonderfully comfortable
