visited paris for the weekend with my yr old daughter as she wanted to practice her french i chose the scribe for it s location and figured with the sofitel name beside it it would be acceptable we were not disappointed the location was great within walking distance to the things we wanted to do and see the reception upon check in was warm and welcoming and our room was upgraded without asking the room itself was modern spacious for paris comfortable and had a small balcony overlooking the street the staff was very polite and always helpful especially the concierge service team emmanuelle with whom i had spoken prior to our arrival with inquiries about possible language activities for my daughter was a complete delight she spoke in french with my daughter the whole time gave helpful suggestions of places to visit and even gave her a lovely parting gift a charming book in french we also had dinner at the hotel restaurant simply delicious as with the other staff members the restaurant staff was helpful polite and very attentive in all it was a lovely albeit short stay and i say merci beaucoup to the staff at the scribe we will definitely be returning
