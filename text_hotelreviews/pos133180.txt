booked this for my parents my mum is not great on dutch stairs so asked for a room on the lower floors and myrthe at the reception was super friendly and accommodating she was pained to see my parents giving up the beautiful room she had prepared for them but ultimately just genuinely cared about their comfort and well being the hotel decor and quality overall is excellent
