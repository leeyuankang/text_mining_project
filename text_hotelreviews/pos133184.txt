good location next to the trendy jordaan neighbourhood most sights are within walking distance our room had a nice view and even a small balcony everything was clean and we liked the bathroom products the hotel is nicely decorated and the restaurant and bar are popular among both locals and guests food is tasty and prices are fair free wifi in the hotel was a plus would stay again
