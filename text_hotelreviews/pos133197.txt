perhaps the best room i ve ever stayed in amsterdam the corner room no is amazing high ceilings and windows on both sides and feels like your own charming home in a great location in amsterdam bed mattress and linen provided an excellent sleep above all the vibe and feeling i got from my stay was the best and that s probably because the property doesn t feel like a hotel the bar and restaurant downstairs looked super nice too
