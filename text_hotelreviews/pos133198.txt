the hotel is in a great location not only in amsterdam but also in the fact that it s right on top of a great bar and restaurant it was really nice to be able to sit in the bar with a coffee or a glass of wine we had breakfast in the restaurant one morning it was really nice but if you prefer to get out and about there are so many cafes nearby we went to mook pancakes one morning about a minute walk in the direction of the museum quarter and it was delicious the staff were all so friendly i didn t see a single person without a smile on their face the room itself was very clean they have everything you would need i don t believe they mentioned having an iron safe and hairdryer in the room but they do beds were really comfy too one thing that was new to us we didn t mind it but other people might the room is split over two levels bathroom and living area on the bottom and bed in the loft the ceiling of the back of the bathroom above the shower opens up to the next floor through a window behind the bed i really liked the little touches in the hotel too especially the door handle text
