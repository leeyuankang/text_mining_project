the rooms are decorated in a modern minimalist style very comfortable bed the air conditioning worked well which was much appreciated as amsterdam was experiencing a heat wave during our mid september stay the location just west of the jordaan district was comfortable one morning we had breakfast at the hotel simple menu but a good range of options another day we walked down the street and bought croissants at a neighbor bakery plus smoked fish from a shop next door ate breakfast on the bench just outside the shop morgan mees is more of a bar and restaurant with about rooms upstairs didn t bother us as once we closed the door to our room it was quiet and we didn t hear any noise double paned windows also kept out street noise
