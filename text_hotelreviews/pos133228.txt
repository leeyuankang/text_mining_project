we only stayed here one night as i had booked somewhere else a while ago and my flight was cancelled but honestly wish i had found this hotel first the staff were amazing they went above and beyond we stayed in the room with a separate floor for the bedroom and a living area the views where great over the canal it was hard leaving the room it was so amazing they knew how bad our trip was to get to amsterdam so got our room ready fast and held out luggage for us we ate in the hotel restaurant just because it seemed silly to go anywhere else as it was packed and the food smelt good considering my boyfriends a chef and hard to please he couldn t stop telling me about how great the food and kitchen was wish i had booked all our nights in amsterdam here it was a great location i will will come back and stay i m not one to leave reviews but this was worth it just to let other people know that you should stay here
