loved the style of this hotel and restaurant ate at the restaurant a few times and the food was excellent the room was super narrow and layout of the room was a bit awkward with the bed upstairs was charming at first then got annoying having to go up and down but that s a minor complaint it s a great place to have dinner even if you don t stay there
