we loved the location it is right on the edge of the center so it is less tourist ey but you are just moments from the action the courtyard was lovely and we enjoyed the meals that we ate in the hotel the bathroom was very clean and we loved the soaps our room a deluxe double was spacious enough and had a good closet we loved the simple and clean decor of the hotel we would definitely stay here again
