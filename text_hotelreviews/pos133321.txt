the staff of the hotel duminy vendome were wonderful they provided me with maps as well as great excellent recommendations that ranged from restaurants to local attractions the location is great as it is blocks from the tuileries garden and an easy walk to the musee du louvre the breakfast was worth every penny and was a great way to start my day i would absolutely recommend this hotel
