check in service great friendly efficient staff all fluent in english we had to change our reservation from single to double occupancy and the staffs were very accommodating and gave us a very good deal considering it was a busy week for them room clean decent size for the price bed was comfortable comforter is not overly heavy and the pillows are great too the safe has instructions and was very easy to use nothing was stolen or missing throughout the week we stayed days good closet space for clothes location unbeatable one street away from metro stop tulleries makes it easy to go to everywhere one street away from rue saint honore near all shopping and restaurant locations plus plenty of banks or atm near by one block away from colette room service food wasn t top notch but definitely not over priced comparing to regular restaurants nearby
