excellent location and a bit cheaper than most hotels nearby our room for the first night was wrapped around the noisy lift well and was on the first floor so got lots of street noise successfully requested a move for the remainder of our stay staff were very helpful fifth floor room was comfortable breakfast selection was pretty good
