the staff we re impeccable across the board we we re checked in sarah who was thoughtful caring professional and quite simply amazing i wholeheartedly believe sarah is being wasted at that hotel and that holiday inn should be utilising such talent to train others at the holiday inn group across the world sarah is an example to all others in the hospitality industry and it was enjoyable to watch a team get along so well and harmoniously which most certainly ensured the service levels we re high the breakfast was reasonably good and the location was exceptional if you want to be in easy reach of everything london has to offer
