the location is absolute top if you like running green park and hyde park are just around the corner piccadilly is just a walk away westminster bridge maybe by foot the big bus hop on hop off bus is just across the street if you prefer travelling by the underground its also just around the corner the staff of the hotel is very very friendly and helpful breakfast ist great with fresh eggs the coffee is not the best though
