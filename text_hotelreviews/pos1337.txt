lovely location very close to the river and a short walk from temple tube lovely walk through temple courts efficient friendly hotel with a great bar really comfy seating and lovely atmosphere restaurant looked good too but we had cocktails and bar snacks in lounge bar which was excellent if a little pricey room styling is modern but well planned and feels a little luxurious love the bathrooms at apex hotels
