the location was ideal for everywhere we wished to visit even though our check in was delayed by nearly two hours because the previous customer was still in the room the staff looked after us very well my wife and i were visiting to celebrate our shared birthdays and we were given an upgrade to an executive room and a complimentary bottle of wine all of which cheered us up after our long wait to check in
