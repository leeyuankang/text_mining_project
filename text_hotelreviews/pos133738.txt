excellent location in the mayfair area of london close to the green park tube station and within walking distance of lots of local attractions we needed to change our plans and the hotel was able to accommodate us easily and without hassle room was comfortable and clean although a bit crowded with two kids restaurant bar was good and breakfast was as well would definitely stay here again
