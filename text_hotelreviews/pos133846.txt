rooms are ok nothing great great location though for shopping galleries theatre sightseeing access and the mayfair nightlife check out the back lanes off berkley street for dining especially some good middle eastern food which is now a dominant culture here nice italian restaurant on the main road there are good english pubs too handy access from green park underground one minute and the hop on hop off buses it is relatively expensive but expect that for the location pays back in limited travel time to everything
