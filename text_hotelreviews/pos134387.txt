the location was fantastic just minutes to notre dame with lots of cafes and shops surrounding the hotel shakespeare and company was down the street and i could see the seine from my room taxi s we readily available and the metro station was less than a block away but walking was the easiest way to get around i d stay here again in a heartbeat all the staff was extremely helpful and friendly
