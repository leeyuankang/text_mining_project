i loved the location train stops from the main central station if arriving by train if you re a walker then you can stroll to notre dame lourve and the eiffel tower easily cosy little hotel with a tiny person lift like all old buildings in europe i was there at the end of june and area was alive but not boisterous safe but just tiny bit aware there is a tourist area just behind the hotel resturants cafes and souvenir shops all vying for your coin i had a bad dinner on the first night restuarant was empty and i felt sorry for the guy but had wonderful coffee and pastry on the morning
