the location was perfect travelling by train with a year old was made a lot easier by the metro being so close you can get direct train to the palace of versailles it was also only a few metro stops to catch the train to disney land paris the hotel was small and friendly the breakfasts were good and we filled up so did not really need lunch i was worried that the room would be to small but for paris sizes it wasn t to bad the hotel is right next to some lovely streets for evening meals drinks or crepes although it was very lively of an evening we were able to go out and eat with our daughter and have a family meal and a little walk around before heading back to the hotel once back in the room we were surprised how quiet it was all in all i would recommend for mini breaks in paris
