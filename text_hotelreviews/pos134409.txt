breakfast great but needs larger room housekeeping staff excellent most front desk staff great one weekday afternoon guy gets out of all others perfect location perfect all in all highly recommended a slightly larger breakfast room sometimes not enough tables this also puts stress on a truly lovely service staff because people get impatient if they are on a tight schedule perhaps half hour time slots could be preschedulled to avoid this tiny conflict would definitely return and highly recommended
