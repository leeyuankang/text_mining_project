loved the location of this hotel the hotel staff were friendly and attentive having a room on the second floor was ideal for us and we enjoyed having a view the room was very well insulated and did not hear noise from the streets beds were comfortable and the room was kept clean we would definitely come back and stay hotel royal st michel
