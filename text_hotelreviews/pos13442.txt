the room was a lot bigger for the price than hotels in paddington it was easy enough to go a few stops further on the tube to hammersmith i felt comfortable walking from the tube station which is in a handy shopping centre to the hotel minute walk and it was easy to find also it is on the direct underground line for heathrow so really easy to get to and from the airport
