i liked most of the staff and their cheery manner once you broke through their training programmed attitudes as most of therm are from the continent it took them a little while to become accustomed to the australian humour they loosened up and they look better with a smile on their faces an observation not every customer would like that but having been in the customer relations business for years of my working life a friendly smile goes a long way for the staff there was one younger female of the front line staff who definitely could do with with a little training in relaxing and that all important smile instead of just doing the business
