the staff are so friendly and professional here i had an issue logging into the wifi my second day there and they sent someone to my room immediately that person couldn t help because my phone was the problem but it was a valiant attempt anyway location is excellent my room was very clean and comfortable breakfast is a good deal if you re very hungry in the mornings and purchase ahead of time
