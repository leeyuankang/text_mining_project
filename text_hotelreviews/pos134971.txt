although i ve given a bad rating for the location on this review the hotel is quite removed from central london it s still very easy to access from the paddington tube train station the environment around it is great too with many bars and restaurants and even a supermarket nearby in a super neat businessy surrounding the staff took care of my issues fast enough and had a friendly smile at all times breakfast was pretty good first time i ve ever seen fried rice served on a breakfast buffet
