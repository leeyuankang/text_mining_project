good strong coffee lots of choice for breakfast that covered even the most fussy eater dining room was very clean and staff attentive we were shown to our tables staff were in no hurry to push us through and clear tables in a hurry and we were asked if there was anything else that could help with i also noticed the nice way they helped with the more elderly people who were on the table next to us and went so far as to get the hot drinks for them which was a nice touch the bedrooms were very clean and so quiet as to make us think there was no one else staying there and the reception staff spoke very good english
