hotel is in walking distance of paddington station minutes through a well lit built up area of bars restaurants and there s even a sainsbury s local nearby reception staff were friendly and helpful even offering to send someone to our room at pm to show us how to get the x box working through the t v for my niece and nephew we declined as it was so late but that was a nice touch breakfast was amazing lots of choice and my nephew was thrilled with the pancake machine going back for seconds and probably more if we d let him we all agreed we would definitely go back again to this hotel without a doubt
