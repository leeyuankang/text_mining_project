great value price as there was some work going on outside related to crossrail which restricted access to the entrance but only marginally good location easy access to tube the redevelopment work around paddington has been brilliant good restaurants and other facilities nearby including little venice and the canals hotel was roomy comfy with friendly and helpful staff
