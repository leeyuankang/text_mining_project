we stayed in the hotel for one night only but found the staff helpful and polite the beds comfortable the hot water plentiful and the breakfast adequate i would like to have seen some fresh fruit available and the location excellent for our purposes what an amazing setting close to the canal and the railway station with access to restaurants
