the staff were very friendly a special shout out to pablo the soothing voiced receptionist one of the most welcoming and well mannered people i ve ever met there was a lot of security which at first might seem excessive but they were very respectful and very helpful of course the food was delicious such a large selection and all so tasty the bedroom was amazing but it was the view which took my breath away the eiffel tower the arc de triomph and other golden landmarks just a glance from the bed the bathroom was modern and clean and the bidet was surprisingly pleasant
