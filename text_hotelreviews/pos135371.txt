although the entire hotel is being renovated it never felt that way at all the staff were so polite and helpful and we were always greeted with a smile the rooms were brilliant after reading other reviews we weren t sure what to expect but were definitely pleasantly surprised the facilities were divine and even though the construction work was being done just below us on that level the rooms were very sound proof definitely will come again
