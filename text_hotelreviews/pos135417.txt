bed pillows were really comfortable although on the down side it was two single mattresses pushed together and secured with velcro rather than a real king size bed as a couple who are used to sleeping with our arms round eachother this wasn t ideal as we had to either stick to our separate sides of the bed squeeze onto one side of the bed or suffer the uncomfortable ridge in the middle the view from our room was excellent and the view from the bar on the top floor was incredible staff were very polite helpful
