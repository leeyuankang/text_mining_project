we stayed in a room that had been recently renovated and so was in very nice condition from reading other reviews it seems that some people were unhappy with the older style of room but there was no problem at all with ours and i think the renovations will be done fairly soon the receptionist was very friendly as well location of the hotel is good very close to a train station and an easy walk to major paris attractions oh and good wi fi throughout the hotel too
