i spent three nights in hyatt regency with my two years old kids we had a club room on floor which was upgraded to a room with eiffel tower view the view was fantastic the kids were amazed i couldn t take them away from the window we had an access to the regency club on the floor offering different food and drinks throughout the day it was really convenient for the pauses we were making after the hours spent visiting sites in paris the breakfast was also served in the club for the club room guests the hotel takes you directly to a metro station through the shopping mall from am to pm in the evenings you should use the street access i see a lot are complaining about the price of the rooms and the hotel bar and restaurant but it was just an average cost of service you get in paris the accommodation and food is extremely expensive everywhere in paris we were warned by the staff about the potential noice by the ongoing reconstruction works in the hotel but we didn t hear anything i would certainly stay here again particularly after the renovation is finished next year
