we stayed at the novotel because we was attending an event at olympia this hotel is in the perfect place easy to get to from the train and a minute walk to olympia there is a huge selection of places to eat on the high street if you choose not to eat in the hotel we had breakfast included with our stay which was lovel and the beds are so comfy would highly reccomend this hotel
