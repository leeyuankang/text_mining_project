didn t used the food there beds are okay as a guest arriving with an own car gives problems there is not a single parking space to park the car to do the check in procedure very inconvenient they just asked you to unload the luggage and you have to leave immediately this gives not a welcoming impression cannot make use of the fridge as it is connected with their central system if you move anything from the fridge they immediately charge you other lower stars hotels gives you the facility to make use of the fridge and gives daily complementary two bottles of water there is no water cooker and complementary coffee or tea lower stars hotels offers much more in room facilities
