i ate at the bar restaurant food was overly priced and horrible skip the fish chips all together the staff was very friendly and helpful and always eager to assist the rooms were small and cold only thing they had were sheets and no comforters to keep us warm throughout the night the heat barely worked and the rooms are really small for the price i chose to rent an apartment for our last night in london just so we could spread out and have some room
