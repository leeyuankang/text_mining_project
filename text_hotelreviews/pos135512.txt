excellent staff at the reception booking counter they made everything possible for instance we made a mistake in our booking but they manage to cancel and redo a new booking with a better room they supported us with all our stuff up to the floor lot of baby thingy to carry they also arranged a baby cot within minutes got that into our room despite we reached there before our planned date room was excellent with a great view of eiffel tower and paris
