location was perfect you can see this hotel from the top of the eiffel tower hotel was beautiful and clean perfect for nights in paris even though hotel is going to be renovated i don t even see why as its modern and clean food in paris is very pricey however breakfast is worth having at hotel as so much to choose from love paris and will be back again
