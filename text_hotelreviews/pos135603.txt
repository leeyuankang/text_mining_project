stayed here for two nights while on our honeymoon and it was amazing great view of the eiffel tower photos do not do it justice excellent buffet breakfast attached to large shopping centre which was good because i got terribly sick and it was nice not to crawl too far to the pharmacy walking distance to all major tourist attractions and metro looked after our luggage on check out so we could have a good look around the city bertille duty manager was very nice and helpful great standards all around
