bar at the top of the hotel was great you can see paris from there but one day they said it is booked with no further notice while our plan was to dine there location of the hotel is perfect and the shopping center and the market with in it were very good information desk was very helpful and made some reservations in advance for us they were also helpful to guide us to move around the city
