everything was just perfect at hyatt regency the room was very clean comfy and the view of eiffel tower from my bed was outstanding especially by night my room was in the floor so i was able to see clearly the eiffel tower and the arch the hotel location is mins walk to the metro and rer station so you can go to champ elysee in stops only eiffel tower stops the breakfast was very very amazing with huge variety and really nice street view as well as friendly crew i strongly recommend this hotel and i can t wait for my next stay there
