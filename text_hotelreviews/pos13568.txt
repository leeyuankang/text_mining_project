i stay every year sometimes twice a year when i exhibit at olympia it is really convenient was very impressed that i got an upgrade to breakfast on this occassion it was a nice touch i don t eat enough breakfast to warrant paying over but being offered a free breakfast meant i could enjoy some fresh fruit and tea before heading off
