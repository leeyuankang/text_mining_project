definitely geared up for business travellers and i would consider staying here for business in the future this trip was for pleasure the staff were very friendly and helpful we had booked a standard room but on arrival were advised that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a great surprise the review is therefore based on this but if we were to go back again we d be more than tempted to go for the upgrade anyway location was perfect for visiting nearby family central london and theatre land is a decent tube journey away but completely do able from here and allowed for a relaxed stay without being in the middle of the madness the whole time
