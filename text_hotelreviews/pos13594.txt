the staff was supremely professional and courteous they offered to let me check in a bit early once the room was ready clarified and resolved a minor clerical error in the booking and made sure all was set for my partner who was arriving after me to pick up a key to the room the breakfast cost extra but was well worth it plenty of options for carnivores and vegetarians alike the hotel is conveniently located between heathrow and central london and has excellent public transport connections there are a number of pubs restaurants cafes and shops tesco boots etc nearby i would definitely stay here again
