january selected as guest of the day and provided with a complimentary room service upgrade novotel hammersmith london uk continues to provide a superbly attentive service friendly beautiful staff a credit to the novotel brand within a contemporary environment on the outskirts of central london so it s in a quieter location and provides value for money the premium room is superbly decorated with a large double bed that is like sleeping on a nimbus cloud for seven hours the provision of high quality absorbent towels in the walk in shower were a delight to use after stepping out of the rain storm like overhead shower the free to access wi fi is consistent throughout the building rooms the bose sound bluetooth sound system was a pleasant surprise overall excellent even if you are not upgraded all the rooms are very good quality and the serve yourself eat as much as you like breakfast is truly remarkable value for money i hate to recommend novotel hammersmith to you as it may mean it would be difficult for me to reserve a room in the future but i will wholeheartedly
