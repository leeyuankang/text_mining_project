i stayed at relais st jacques for the third time and found the room beautifully and tastefully decorated and clean the bed was clean and comfortable the bathroom perfect with snow white towels flannels robe and slippers i thoroughly enjoyed the bath jacuzzi and the fresh smelling toiletries the little hygiene pack is a brilliant idea as one often forgets the little cotton buds the staff is excellent competent and friendly particularly the lovely lady who runs the kitchen and serves breakfast the breakfast is brilliant and caters for all tastes the hotel is ideally situated in a safe area an added bonus for me is its proximity to the curie institute where i receive treatment and the quartier mouffetard i love plenty of lovely restaurant within walking distance it is in every possible way
