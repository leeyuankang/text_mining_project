great boutique type hotel at higher quality and lower price than other paris hotels had to stay in the highly rated marriott rive gauche for work a few days later and that was terrible in comparison would much rather stay at the st jacques they gave us the room with a french balcony which was lovely windows very sound proof quiet room
