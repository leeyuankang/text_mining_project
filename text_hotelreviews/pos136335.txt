we arrived early and the hotel staff not only let us check in early they told us to eat breakfast for free while we waited the breakfast was amazing and we did pay to eat it in the morning the room was comfortable and quiet and only a few minutes from concord and in a great high end shopping area the staff were kind and helpful and stored our luggage for us the next morning we enjoyed spending the first night of our honeymoon here and would have stayed again if they weren t booked
