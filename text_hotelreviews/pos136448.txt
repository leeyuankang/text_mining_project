located in a lovely area with plenty of cafes and places to eat close to a well connected subway station and we also had a nice walk up to sacre coeur from the hotel we re allowed to check in minutes early as this is when we arrived and hotel held our luggage for us on our last day until our eurostar which gave us a full extra day to explore without having to carry luggage around paris
