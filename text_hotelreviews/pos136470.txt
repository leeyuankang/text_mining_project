it was our first time in paris the hotel was in a lovely part of the city and just a few minutes walk from the metro station place de clichy we were very happy with our room a very clean and modern interior we were especially happy with the wonderful view of the eiffel tower we had paid for a privilege room and received fluffy robes and slippers and there was a coffee machine tv and ipod docking station in our room the staff were very friendly we would definitely return here and would recommend it to friends
