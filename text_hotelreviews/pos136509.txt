location was great min walk from metro clichy paid a little extra for a privileged room on the floor room came with coffee machine robe and slippers and a killer view of the eiffel tower and sunsets absolutely fantastic whould definitely stay here again very convenient and easy location to get around good restaurants within a block either direction and minute walk to catch a hop on hop off open tour bus i felt very safe walking around during the day on my own and the streets are busy with people in the evening too
