great hotel in a very nice neighborhood of paris the corner street is rue des martyrs with award winning bakeries and chocolatiers many cafes and stores great iberian ham shop and also a corsican deli and a couple of italian restaurants in fact the area was so nice that we did not stray from montmartre at all our hotel room was small by american standards but a good size for paris and extremely clean modern comfortable and quiet
