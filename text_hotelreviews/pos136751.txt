wonderful friendly and helpful staff great location place was very clean we had room with small balcony and enjoyed being able to step outside for some fresh air room was small but adequate for our needs we spent very little time in the room we used taxis and the staff were able to call us a taxi each time we needed one and the taxi showed up within minutes
