we stayed in a nice quiet room which was not very spacious but comfortable the bathroom with a big window has all necessary amenities including bathrobes very good breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice and a nice choice of fruit and pastry the hotel is situated close to metro min and surrounded my charming little shops and restaurants highly recommended
