perfect location in paris with beautiful local shops along the street and a general parisian culture located a short walk from montmartre sacre coeur and moulin rouge with excellent tube links to the rest of the city excellent reception staff room was perhaps a bit cosy but well decorated furnished excellent air conditioning was a life saver
