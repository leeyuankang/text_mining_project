this was an excellent hotel there is a turkish hammam and small swimming pool which was a big hit with the kids the hotel is small but the staff are nice and friendly especially halim thari and nicolas the location is fantastic there are at least two superb patisseries down the road on rue de martyrs which provided outstanding breakfast we opted not to have the breakfast in the hotel because of this there is also a small carrefour close by loads of restaurants all around one can catch the line metro at place st george which is less than mts away but other stations like pigalle or notre dame de lorette are also close montmartre is just about a minute walk all in all this was a great place and i will certainly consider staying here again it is not cheap but i felt that it provided excellent value for money there were four of us including my wife and two girls and the year old had a separate single bed the hotel had provided another single inflatable bed for the year old free of cost the room was spacious by european standards and the bathroom fittings and furnishings were of high standard the most fascinating thing were the windows with electrically operated shades they were very fancy as far as i could make out they were also sensitive to rain and close automatically if it rained all in all a great experience
