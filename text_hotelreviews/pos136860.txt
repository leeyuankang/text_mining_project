perfect paris location close to assembly nationale and the invalides metro quiet street beautiful area very close to musee rodin small hotel that is very luxurious large room that is modern but still feels like older paris building with lots of wood working and tall ceilings staff was very friendly and gracious the breakfast is excellent and worth adding scrambled eggs pastries meats fruits etc not an inexpensive hotel but for the quality and location in paris we think it is a good value we look forward to coming back
