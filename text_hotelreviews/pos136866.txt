great hotel in a great location the staff were the nicest we ve ever encountered it was our wedding anniversary and on arrival to the room we were presented with champagne and macaroons the room was very cosy and fully equipped with the comfiest bed ever the area was very quiet but with the national assembly on holidays that might change just over the bridge is place de la concorde and down the boulevard is st germain where there are so many restaurants to choose from would definitely stay there again
