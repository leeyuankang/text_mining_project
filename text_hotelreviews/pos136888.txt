we had the executive room and it was great very spacious for paris and extremely comfortable great bed and well decorated the location was great only blocks from the metro and in a lovely neighbourhood walking distance from the eiffel tower and the rodin musee and still very well connected to places like montmartre same metro line the staff were great we wanted to practice our rustic french and they were extremely patient with us when it would have been much easier for them to switch to english breakfast was lovely too
