very welcoming staff and very clean and stylish hotel it s in the perfect location within walking distance of all the main touristy attractions eiffel tower louvre etc we only needed to use a taxi train to get from the eurostar to the hotel the hotel is also opposite a lovely patisserie and the area feels very safe was very quiet at night and didn t have any problems
