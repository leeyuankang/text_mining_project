prime location in a quiet area in the heart of paris as it is very prestigiously located right behind the parliament close enough to walk most places champs elysees eiffel tower galleries lafayette louvre museum tuilleries garden etc or otherwise use the metro stations very close by staff were very friendly helpful and caring the room we got was very spacious with good wardrobe space and a huge bathroom my husband was very very impressed even though he is not generally a fan of boutique hotels would definitely recommend
