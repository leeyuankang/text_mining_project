the staff were very helpful i had travelled to the hotel for work and this was booked through my company with the weekend covered through booking com when i checked in the staff couldn t have been more helpful to make sure we had the same room for the whole duration of our trip and also made sure my wife could access the room the following day when she arrived during our stay i was recovering from leg surgery and the staff couldn t have been more helpful in assisting us the breakfast was great and the location was perfect for exploring all the normal locations in paris
