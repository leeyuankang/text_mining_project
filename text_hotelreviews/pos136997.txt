my stay was during the terrorist attacks november the hotel sent out a letter to all guests to outline the extra security measures that were put into place immediately security guards at the entrance and waiver of early check out fees if guests opted to leave the entire staff was very accommodating during that horrible event and helped me get in touch with the embassy which was very close to the hotel the hotel is in a great location and walking distance to most points of interest couple blocks place dela concorde louvre etc
