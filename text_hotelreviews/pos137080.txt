we selected hotel montalembert based on the recommendation of a friend who is a frequent traveler to paris and who has stayed at many hotels there we are very selective as to where we stay on this trip we stayed at the connaught in london and took the train to paris the hotel arranged a vip receptionist and chauffeur mercedes to bring us to the hotel prior to our arrival we had corresponded several times with the concierge to arrange restaurant reservations the concierge was exceptional the staff was both friendly and professional one of the best things about the hotel is its location we walked virtually everywhere it is a minute walk to the seine and across the bridge to the louvre the neighborhood is filled with great little shops and cafes bakeries cheese shops there are two michelin star restaurants within yds we highly recommend it upon our departure the hotel arranged an excellent driver to take us to the airport he also was excellent navigated around freeway accident and got us to the specal air france premiere departure area which saved us at least an hour
