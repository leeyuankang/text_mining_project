booked this hotel on the strength of booking com reviews and for english customers more particularly on the strength of the overly gushing reviews in the daily telegraph travel article of the most romantic paris hotels dated december do not book here on the strength of that review as it is over sold first of all the hotel is in an excellent location just off the champs elysee it is in a narrow side street it has a nice frontage but very small foyer which can be a problem if several guests arrive at thew same time the feel is quite nice and the ambience relatively quirky particularly when you take the old lift room were well appointed with good linens and furnishings our room had a very small balcony almost too small to actually use other than to step out on but added to the ambience of what was quite a small space hard flooring did not lend itself to luxury bathroom and separate toilet were ok but nothing special and the toilet would be too small for very large people the reception service and assistance was good as was the cocktail bar with extremely nice drinks expensive though all in all a good stay in a hotel missing the mark as an altogether quirky boutique stay
