this was a lovely little hotel off the champs elysee in a historic building this is not my favorite part of paris as it s very touristy but if you want to be centrally located this hotel is a good value the room was a decent size for people most older paris hotels have tiny rooms nicely decorated and with a modern bathroom the hotel was walking distance to our paris offices and the metro the staff spoke good english tolerated my broken french and were cheerful and helpful i would stay there again on my next business trip
