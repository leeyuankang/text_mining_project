the room was very clean and the beds very comfortable the staff were so friendly welcoming and helpful i felt nothing would be too much trouble for them it felt relaxing and welcoming i loved the feel of the place with the tiny lift and spiral stairs and other features that were typical of the period located just off the champs elleyse it was a perfect base from which to explore paris
