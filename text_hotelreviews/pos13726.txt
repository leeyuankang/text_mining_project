the location was ideal for anyone visiting the hammersmith apollo within easy walking distance or wishing to explore further afield plenty of places to eat near the hotel we only ate breakfast in the hotel which was plentiful and very good choice of continental or cooked so cannot comment of quality or value of hotel s restaurant for dining
