very pleasant hotel charming in every sense decors are smart and the space which is a very parisian issue everywhere is properly used i asked for a quiet room and i got it still this hotel is right in the heart of the move in paris so i guess other rooms could be less quiet rue lepic and montmartre are right there enough to make your trip to paris metro blanche is a one minute walk ideal choice i would say
