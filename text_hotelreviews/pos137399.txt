the hotel is well appointed and has been brought up to date with thought and care the staff are great and rue lepic is one of the most dynamic places in paris lots of very good restaurants and bars the shops provide the variety you would expect to find in a typical french street market fantastic position if you are going to the moulin rouge or montmartre
