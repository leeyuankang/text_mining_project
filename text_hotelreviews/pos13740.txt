i particularly liked the excellent customer service the hotel maintenance guy david fixed the retractable handle of my carry on luggage that got detached it was very much appreciated because we were just starting our holiday and my other option was to find a samsonite service center in london to take it to and i m not sure if they were going to be able to repair it quickly the reception staff was always helpful and accommodating the breakfast buffet was great and the best we had in the hotels we stayed in during our week holiday in london and europe
