very close to the metro many restaurants bars and bakeries quaint historic neighbourhood with narrow cobblestone streets hotel room was wonderfully atmospheric with a lot of attention to detail clearly seen in the choice of furnishings super friendly staff we arrived at and our room was already ready and they let us check in early at no extra cost
