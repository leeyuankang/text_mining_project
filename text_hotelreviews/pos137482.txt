a very pleasant hotel quite conveniently located for the palais de congres convention centre but maybe a little less ideal to see the major tourist sights of paris there was a nearby metro and the arc de triomphe area was an easy walk the front staff were very happy to call for taxis the front staff were very nice and helpful particularly ms dolma mr andre and mr cyril wifi was good although you have to validate all devices every day nearby boucherie boulanger and cafes very good
