the hotel s location is excellent near arc du triomphe and champs elys es there s a metro station minutes away which is also very nice as well as all sorts of places to eat or have a coffee all in all it s a good value for the money it s a nice clean comfortable place the room was quiet tastefully decorated and with a good size for a couple the wi fi worked perfectly for both of us
