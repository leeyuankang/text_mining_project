hotel was good for value we didn t eat in the hotel metro station near by room were clean had a bath and shower combined we stayed in a standard room so the picture didn t look like the ones advertised probably would stay again for the price we got it view was of a shared alley way not to pleasant but we didn t spend time in the room
