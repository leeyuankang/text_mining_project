super location close to arc de triomphe and min easy walk to metro on lines which give very good links throughout the city also some nice bakeries and shops around room was a very good size and well cleaned if the mini bar had worked i would have said it had everything i needed the staff were friendly and helpful while dealing with every day matters when a problem arose the manager did not deal with it that well and the receptionist did not seem to know what to do once the problem was dealt with the receptionist returned to friendly and polite the manager was ok ish
