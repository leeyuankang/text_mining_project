the staff were extremely friendly on check in and even offered us a room upgrade which was a welcome surprise the location is brilliant for tourists and it s very easy to wander to the louvre hotel de ville champs elysee etc rooms were very quiet with dark curtains we had a little juliet balcony so could open doors
