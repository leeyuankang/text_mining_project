i was upgraded to a bigger room on the ground floor which was very quiet i was working late and up very early for a busy work day so this was important which they acknowledged from the notes on my booking staff were very friendly and helpful even after i had checked out but returned a few hours later to store my bags and charge my phone for a few hours before my train home stunning location restaurant where hotel food comes from was delicious
