really good location only mins in the uber taxi which were really cheap hotel had building work on going but this did not affect us breakfast was continental my only negative is that we booked a superior room hoping it was going to be a good size but unfortunately it was a bit small and the beds were very small more like children size staff were very friendly and there service was excellent thank you for having us
