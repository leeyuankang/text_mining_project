very comfortable and spacious rooms and the bathroom had a great powerful shower the location is ideal if you re working anywhere near liverpool street moorgate the overall feel of the hotel is more boutique but you have the service levels and facilities of a larger hotel there is also a great restaurant and rooftop bar the staff were very helpful and i found their room service and same day laundry service very useful there is also the option to have a hairdresser come to the hotel if you have a special occasion although i would recommend booking this in advance of your trip if possible free newspapers were also supplied on request including the ft i will definitely be staying at this hotel again next time i am in london for me it is the perfect sized hotel with all the home away from home comforts that you need
