we stayed for our silver wedding anniversary the staff could not have been more helpful friendly they spoiled us rotten we found a specially decorated plate bearing cake in our room at tea time then a beautiful heart made of rose petals on our bed at the end of the day these touches made us feel really special thank you for your care
