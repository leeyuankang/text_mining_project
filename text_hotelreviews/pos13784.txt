great hotel nice lobby and bar area check in was very quick and efficient we stayed previous and they double scanned our card and took additional money that took some time to work out and have put back in our account so i would recommend paying upfront and not presenting a card for extras room was good size with comfy bed and good bathroom and shower facility good location a five to ten minute walk to hammersmith apollo and a five to seven minute walk to hammersmith tube station all in all a good stay
