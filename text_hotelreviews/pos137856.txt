e v e r y t h i n g no but seriously i have no words for how amazing this hotel actually is we were speechless when we walked into our room got to the reception was given complimentary glass of champagne then got told our room was upgraded as it was our anniversary i don t know where to even begin with the room let s just say it was perfection felt more like our own apartment so cosy so modern absolutely beautiful interior design we had two showers two sinks a massive bathtub a huge mirror in the bedroom we had lamps hanging down from the wall which look amazing also had led lights making the bed light up underneath free movies to watch on the tv and also got complimentary soft drinks from the minibar oh not to forget the most beautiful spa i have ever seen been in highly recommend this hotel honestly cannot wait to go back i want to move in it was worth every single penny we paid to stay
