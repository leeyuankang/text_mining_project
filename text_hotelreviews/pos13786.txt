on arrival we were greeted by aurelia at reception she upgraded us to an executive room and we were given vouchers for a free glass of prosecco each at the bar we instantly felt quite special thanks to her and her excellent service we ate at the bar in the everning we had the mini burgers the chicken ones were too pink for our taste so we sent them back they brought us new ones but these were the same i guess that s just how they do them our waiter did tell us he knew they were cooked because they were finished in the microwave we were given a free glass of wine to compensate us for the dissappointment the room was super comfortable excellent bed great shower and fabulous view of the city skyline having a nespresso machine that we were free to use was a lovely touch too we had breakfast in the aroma buffet and it was excellent there was no shortage of food and fresh food kept arriving all the while overall a very good experience would visit this hotel again
