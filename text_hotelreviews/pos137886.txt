overall experience was amazing from the incredibly warm welcome upon arrival to the surprise birthday cake in the room staff were so friendly and the facilities at the hotel were great i used both the gym and the steam room really strong wifi which is rare for a hotel room was so comfortable and the black out blinds meant i got a good sleep
