i arrived way too early for checkin and just wanted to drop off my bag the friendly receptionist provided me with a room within seconds at no extra cost gym and sauna are open and very modern as the rest of the hotel too proper building quality and windows not comparable with the typical squeezed and dirty rooms in most established hotels in london great stay thanks a lot
