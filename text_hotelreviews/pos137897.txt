my time staying in this hotel there was massive construction work going on and it was already very very noisy from early morning until late afternoon for the first nights my mom and i didn t have a good rest and sleep due to this but the hotel staff were endeavour to arrange another quiet room for the rest of our stays just because of this i will definitely be coming back although i know the construction is going to last long besides very good shower which i think is very important to my mom and i thanks to housekeeping and every single staff working in the hotel and very delicious brownies and macarons upon check in and out from the hotel manager thanks very much
