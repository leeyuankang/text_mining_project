service staff is very professional well groomed and attentive the front desk manager promptly clarified questions i had about my bill in email explaining to me the breakdown of charges i came out ahead kudos to her location right near the tube and a minute walk away from tons of restaurants i don t know all the areas of london well but sure seemed like a convenient location restaurant food was excellent just one or two minor service hiccups forgot to bring my coffee and awkwardness dealing with payment but for the most part the quality was outstanding
