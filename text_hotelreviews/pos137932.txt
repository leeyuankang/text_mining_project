as always i love the friendliness and helpfulness of south place s staff nothing is too much trouble and they were attentive and obliging throughout my stay my room was upgraded upon arrival always a nice bonus and a great way to reward frequent visitors the room service is excellent and i love the fact that all the films which would be pay per view at other hotels are free at south place
