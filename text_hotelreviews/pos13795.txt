staff were extremely helpful fixed a thermostat problem when they said they would when we went to the restaurant at one night just for dessert it had closed but david restaurant manager ordered room service for us and looked after us brilliantly although hotel was very busy the bedroom areas were quiet and we slept great very comfy beds and pillows breakfast was very good and again the service from staff was spot on the location also worked very well for us
