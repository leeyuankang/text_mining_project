this was my second booking at the hotel and we found it a quiet place to stay in the sussex gardens area room was large and we enjoyed having a bathtub the location can t be beat a five minute walk to paddington station we chose to not eat breakfast at the hotel because as with all hotels it was fairly pricey delightful little cafe a short block away for breakfast
