as a returning client over many years i cannot speak highly enough of the service which is above and beyond expectations the warm friendly welcome and most obliging staff are superb i could not have been better treated as a guest as a long haul traveler i usually arrive at the hotel at an unavoidably early hour and the staff go out of their way to ensure i am made as comfortable as possible if my room is not ready much appreciated the new bar area and bar service is a welcome addition too the decor is very nicely done and the light snack menu is great when you don t want to dine out
