love the royal park we ve been many times and stayed in all types of room from standard to four poster with the same excellent quality in all rooms extremely comfy beds and the addition of coffee machine kettle is great the new bar area is a great addition and although we didn t eat from the menu the food that other people were having looked really nice very handy for the heathrow express underground stations and buses including the london tourist bus
