staff i ve seen excellent reviews for the staff in this hotel and was sceptic about it i was doubt room was made perfectly special thanks to the reception staff everything was perfect clean room comfy bad maybe it will be bit noisy for people who like to woke up after bear in mind security deposit of gbp per room per night will be blocked on your card we haven t purchased breakfast so i won t be helpful in this issue if you re not in a mood in the morning be sure hotel s staff will make you smile when you leave seriously it s the best customer service i ve ever met in the hotels
