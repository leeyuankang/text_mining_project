we booked our poster king bed suite to celebrate our anniversary and could not have been happier the hotel was adorable located on a lovely quiet street with easy access to the tube and paddington station we wanted a hotel with some of that inimitable english charm and the royal park hotel delivered just that the staff was the best part as friendly and helpful as possible and just plain good company our room was perfect for the two of us to spend what little down time we had during our week s stay we highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be well taken care of while visiting london
