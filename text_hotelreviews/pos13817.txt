came to see billy connolly at the hammersmith apollo our check in check out were both hassle free and easy with helpful friendly staff room was clean comfortable and we had a good nights sleep there was a really good choice at breakfast and plenty of seating well located for the underground too so we could do a little sightseeing would definitely stay again
