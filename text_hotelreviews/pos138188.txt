stay here everytime we visit london love the friendly staff and the location close to oxford street and hyde park off the busy roads and minutes walk from paddington beds are very comfortable and overall facilities are good breakfast is good but a little on the expensive side love the garden a little oasis in the center of the london bustle overall another great stay
