very comfortable bed small but really nice shower room good water pressure spotlessly clean i liked the room good amenities nice decor full length mirror iron and board multi socket for charging or using electronic devices plus a small fridge are thoughtful extras reception staff are very friendly and welcoming the situation very near to transport and shops restaurants etc yet in a leafy london square is perfect
