room design is fantastic and kooky tv screens massive shower had good water pressure and distribution from the shower head bed very comfortable nice and hard pillows new and also comfortable staff helpful and accommodating but perhaps not expected to be concierges location as noted excellent due to proximity to tube station and bus stops
