i liked all of it location was great and nearby earl s court underground station area was nice and not too loud room was spotless and comfortable especially bed was really comfy and steady the best surprise for me was that hairdryer was in the bathroom and was really good it keeps the actual room much cleaner cos no hairs on the carpet breakfast was a pleasant surprise after some reviews because there was good products and it was enough amount of choices to start our days well also the breakfast room was really tidy
