what a find and what a gem of a modern boutique hotel a peaceful retreat in a lovely situation yet only minutes away from a tube station and excellent transport links a long established hotel but refurbished during the last few years our double room was so well appointed modern light and airy with excellent facilities such as the ultra modern bathroom and easy to adjust heating system the beds were extremely comfortable two marvellous nights sleep breakfast was included in the excellent room rate making this exceptional value for money the continental breakfast was plentiful with extremely helpful efficient staff seated in the conservatory which was light bright and inviting everywhere was spotlessly clean throughout the hotel the reception area was welcoming and secure being able to leave luggage for collection was a real plus once again all the reception staff were so very helpful we liked the idea of the loyalty scheme since it suggests a genuine interest in retaining your custom this was our first time at the henley house hotel but it definitely won t be our last already signed up to the loyalty scheme many thanks for a superb stay
