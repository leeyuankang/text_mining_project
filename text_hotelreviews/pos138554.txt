clean modern and close to most things we stayed a week here on the top floor and found everything to be really great it is close to the underground and shops breakfast was ok continental but you could boil a egg and the staff would cook some toast nice view from the room of a park across the road staff great quite from outside noise but thin walls inside we could hear the tv and talking from the room next door
