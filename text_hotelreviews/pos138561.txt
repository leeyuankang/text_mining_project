london hotels are fairly pricey when you are looking for a decent standard with decent decor i spent several hours trawling through and dismissing hotels until i stumbled across this little gem perfect location to the tube lovely modern clean rooms and even breakfast included in the price not all that common for london hotels to top it off it is very reasonably priced keep up the good work and if the price stays reasonable we will definitely use this hotel again
