the very cheery and helpful receptionist made our short stay very enjoyable she went out of her way to advise us regarding timetables and routes and we came away with a smile the hotel is small but cosy the rooms are again small but very well laid out and very comfortable and clean overlooking the garden at the rear of the property was an added bonus breakfast was buffet with choices and very adequate we would definitely use again and hopefully see the lovely staff again
