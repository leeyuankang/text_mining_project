the proximity to earls court station was great for us as travelling with bags is not easy it is a charming building facing a private square so the outlook if you are lucky enough to get a balcony room as we were is lovely the room had been recently refurbished and had a comfortable bed with tea coffee making facilities and a good wi fi connection the staff were very very helpful and pleasant
