we stay in london every now and then and this was our first time at henley house we cannot even compare this to other hotels in london for the some price where we have stayed previously we got a big room with an amazing view the room was newly refurbished with luxurious bathroom the service was perfect such great staff giving more individual service than in big chain hotels the location is also perfect beautiful part of the city close to many restaurants coffee shops and pubs as well as tube station we will definitely go back
