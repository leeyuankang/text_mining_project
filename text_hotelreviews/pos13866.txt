hotel was clean and staff very friendly and helpful it was located only walk from hammersmith underground station so very handy for travelling into central london we flew into stansted which was about train journey to liverpool street then a further to hammersmith on underground the hotel was also close to a shopping centre and places to eat however the restaurants in the hotel looked very nice our room looked like it had recently been decorated and the rest of hotel was under going renovation during our stay would definitely recommend for anyone visiting london
