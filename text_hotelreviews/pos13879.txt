check in was quick and efficient concierge was helpful and took our cases for us as we arrived early at the hotel and could not check in until later checking out was also easy and the receptionist booked us a taxi to take us back to train station which arrived promptly hotel was a great location for olympia where we were attending the olympia horse show room spacious and comfortable and breakfast was lovely
