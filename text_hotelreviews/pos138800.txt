location is perfect shops pubs and good food everywhere breakfast was ok but there were no fresh vegetables at all we chose this hotel because we wanted to explore northern london walking along the regent s canal was a pleasant experience from camden lock to limehouse basin staff working in a reception and in restaurant when having breakfast were friendly and helpful hotel has seen its best years our room something could be done to modernize our room was a bit old fashioned
