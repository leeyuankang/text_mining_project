location was amazing just feet away from all the main attractions of camden bed was comfy and shower facilities were spotless nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they even let us keep our luggage there once we checked out so we could spend our last remaining hours in camden comfortably without carrying heavy luggage around staff always greeted guests with a smile having a starbucks downstairs really made the hotel wonderful i can t wait to visit again
