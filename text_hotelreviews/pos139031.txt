location was excellent and check in staff were pleasant and helpful room was spotless credit to the cleaning staff breakfast was quite pricy compared to other hotels and so was drinks should be more tea coffee and different assortments in the room as well as biscuits for the price we were paying would only stop in this hotel again for the location but would use other hotels elsewhere as thought it was expensive
