the hotel was really clean and inviting and were even given a fresh cookie each on arrival we had a twin room which was comfy and spacious enough for the two of us huge choice of breakfast available including a cooked breakfast buffet style location was great for westminster it took us about minutes to walk to the west end which for us was absolutely fine
