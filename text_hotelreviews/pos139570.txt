good location near lambeth bridge and tate britain on john islip street but a back entrance lets you out directly onto the thames nearest tube station is pimlico but it isn t too much further to walk to vauxhall or westminster staff all very pleasant and helpful both at reception and breakfast we had booked an executive room so were able to avail ourselves of the wine and canap s on friday evening before our trip to the theatre we could have had breakfast in the executive lounge too but chose to eat in the main restaurant where there is a lot more choice at no extra cost excellent breakfast with plenty of choice lovely bread
