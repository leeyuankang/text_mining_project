i particularly liked the location it is very conveniently located in fact i would say that it is perfectly located it is just a short walk to parliament and to major attractions the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful the hotel is really great for a business trip but i would definitely stay there again for a vacation
