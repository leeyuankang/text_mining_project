jason harris the concierge guy who just brought back my faith into humanity my luggage was delayed and i had to stay in london for days trying to contact the airlines airports and the baggage claim agencies if i was lucky to get a reply form a human and not the automat robot it went along your case has been forwarded to jason listened jason really listened and bothered to do all the calling and fighting on my behalf jason relieved me from anxiety just by being empathetic fully professional and going the extra mile the hotel had absolutely nothing to do with my lost luggage but during the check out jason even hired a cab for me to catch my express to the airport i was going to take a bus or tube to the station and it was even prepaid so yes for me jason harris represents not only the excellent quality of service of doubletree by hilton but their genuine care for guests and my feeling is jason was not an exception i could feel the extra care from other staff as well mainly in the caf during the breakfast it s just that jason exceeded all of my expectations the unbelievably delicious warm chocolate cookies they give you at the reception i even took some for my mom back to my hometown
