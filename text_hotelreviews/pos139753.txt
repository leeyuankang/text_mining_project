nice touch with the cookies on arrival and whenever you fancied one we were staying for nights and opted not to take the housekeeping every day as offered so ran out of tea bags and milk which was the only niggle we had to ask for them at reception staff were all very helpful and cheerful throughout our stay very comfortable bed breakfast choice was excellent and catered for all dietary needs
