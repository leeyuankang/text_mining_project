really impressed with staff overall and excellent service i extended my stay and cancelled another booking at other hotels safe light bright clean hotel with very modern lifts and rooms we ate most nights in the restaurant as my year old was often tired and had a good kids menu great breakfasts and staff excellent safe location for families good for walking government area so be prepared to walk min to things but easy to get to anywhere else quickly black cab rank outside great for night time
