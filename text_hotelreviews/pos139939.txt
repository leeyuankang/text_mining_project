the chocolate chip cookies on reception were scrumptious executive lounge brilliant food to die for rooms crisp and fresh lots of facilities we were treated like kings because my son had his birthday there the staff gave him a hilton teddy and a tin of cookies and we were upgraded would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone
