very helpful and pleasant reception staff our trip to london was a birthday present for my daughter so the staff had the room decorated with balloons and put some nice presents for my kid the location of the hotel seems to be ideal all the major london sights are reachable by foot if you happen to fly via gatwick victoria station with its gatwick express is within a walking distance from the hotel notwithstanding its central location the hotel is very quiet even for such a sensitive to noise person as i a separate praise goes to breakfasts the breakfasts are extremely good
