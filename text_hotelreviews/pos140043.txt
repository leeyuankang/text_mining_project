london is a pricey town and this hotel was exactly what you would expect from a doubletree anywhere else at a premium price that may sound bad but it isn t meant that way we had a very comfortable room and we enjoyed the location very much the staff was nice we didn t really spend much time with them except for check in and check out but they were friendly and professional we traveled in early september and it seemed as if the hotel was filled with mostly business travelers there is still construction happening across the street from the hotel we did not experience any issues with noise but if you re looking for a spectacular view that could be problematic once again this is not the hotels fault just something to be aware of before you decide to book overall the room was comfortable and spacious enough for us and our luggage and you can t beat the location if you are interested in seeing big ben and westminster abbey which are all very close by it also makes it easier to catch one of the boat rides on the thames that take off from westminster pier
