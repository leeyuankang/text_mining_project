great location for walking on the thames and pimlico tube station is mins easy walk pimlico itself has some great bars restaurants and cafes check out tony s cafe on chapel street for authentic fry ups and a friendly welcome the hotel was clean spacious and the bar is nice the concierge knows his stuff and all his recommendations were great we had some lovely meals thanks for the free drinks voucher to celebrate our anniversary it s a shame i found it at the bottom of my case when we got home though its the thought that counts i d stay here again although the executive deal we got made it much more affordable not sure i d be happy paying almost per night we had a great stay though thanks
