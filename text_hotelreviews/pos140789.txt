we were very satisfied with the blakemore hotel our room an executive room was spacious and very comfortable the air conditioning was very welcome as it was rather hot in london when we were there the staff were very friendly and kind breakfast was quite good although i didn t understand why they charged extra for the full breakfast the room was already pretty pricy so even if they slapped this price onto the room price we might not have felt it and had a much better feeling the location for us was really good as we wanted to be near a tube line bayswater station on the district line which goes straight to wimbledon connections to other parts of the city were also convenient queensway tube station min from hotel only stops to oxford street
