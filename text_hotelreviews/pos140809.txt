we had a spacious comfortable room the staff were friendly and the continental breakfast was very good with the addition of a full english breakfast for a very reasonable supplement it looked good too although the continental breakfast was ok for us the hotel was fairly central and only a couple of minutes from hyde park so great for an early morning stroll in the sunshine i would definitely stay here again
