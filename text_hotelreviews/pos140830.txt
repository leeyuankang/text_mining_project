we have stayed here before so knew what to expect the staff were friendly and check in was relatively easy my wife and i enjoy walking and it is a nice walk into oxford street from the hotel and also had a great walk around kensington gardens and hyde park the breakfast choices were very good and the restaurant had a good selection and what we had was cooked really well it was also a nice atmosphere sitting outside in the evenings having a drink definitely will be going to the blakemore again
