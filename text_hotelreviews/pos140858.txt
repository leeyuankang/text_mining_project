nice hotel to stay away from the bustle of london whilst being close to everything there was a large comfortable bed in a spacious room the room we were allocated was on the ground floor at the front the hotel is located on a quiet street but even when traffic was passing the hotel we didn t hear it at all and were not disturbed the only disturbance was in the morning from the room upstairs which obviously had several children in it who were jumping up and down rather a lot which was noisy but that s hardly the fault of the hotel it takes minutes to walk to the hotel from paddington station and less than that to walk to bayswater tube station hyde park is minutes walk away so the hotel is well situated
