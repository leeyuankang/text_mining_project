the hotel is in a beautiful area beside hyde park and very easily accessible from the tube or taxis inside the hotel itself is decorated beautifully and in my experience the staff were extremely helpful chatty and pleasant also when we arrived they upgraded us to a junior suite which we both thought was a lovely gesture we did not eat in the hotel but i ordered room service on one of the nights i was quite tipsy and got peckish i ordered a margarita pizza which was really nice and the lady i was speaking to about where i was going to after my stay there was really friendly and wished me well for my further travels i was going to bali the next morning and had to come to london to fly there i would definitely recommend this hotel both for the area the aesthetics of the place the staff and the value for money i will be back to stay
