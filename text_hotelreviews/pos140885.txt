the hotel is located in a relatively quiet neighborhood near hyde park an underground station is nearby so you can reach any major london attraction fairly quickly the staff was very professional and friendly our room was clean attractive and comfortable the complimentary continental breakfast was a very good way to start each day overall we had a good experience and would recommend this hotel
