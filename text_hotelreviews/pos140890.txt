we had an amazing stay at this hotel we checked in late and had booked an executive room only to be told we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite this completely helped to make our already amazing trip to london even more memorable thank you so much to the lovely staff the room was amazing and we will definitely stay here again if we visit london again only downside was the breakfast we pre booked was only continental and a further cost was needed for a hot breakfast which we knew nothing of until we arrived for breakfast other than that we could not fault the hotel
