good choice of continental breakfast plenty of seating rare queues though in the basement the room is air conditioned light and with an airy feel public rooms and corridors are well proportioned and quiet the restaurant caters for most tastes and pockets the bar is well stocked the wine list is adventurous and the wine well kept bedrooms and bathrooms are spotless and generally well appointed the beds are comfortable yet supportive given the general warmth of the building few guests should need more than the quilt provided guests have self control of air conditioning and central heating though window openings are restricted for safety reasons the available air flow is adequate
