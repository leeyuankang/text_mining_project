lovely staff they upgraded us from a twin room to a junior suite for free the room itself was spacious comfortable and impeccably clean the hotel is located in a very posh part of london a stone s throw from hyde park and within walking distance of two tube stations bayswater and queensway the continental breakfast included in the room rate was varied and tasty
