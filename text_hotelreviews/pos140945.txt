noticed on check out that we were the only people not to have gotten a promotion price for our stay in fact they had accidentally added a very small surcharge which when questioned was deducted from our bill sad as we will have both our daughters in london in a couple of months will be visiting london at least every weeks we booked paid for our stay months ago after being told assured that that was their best price when it was plain to see other guests checking out bills on the reception desk for all to see that the price we paid was far from their best price
