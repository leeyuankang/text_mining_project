the room rate included a continental breakfast which we enjoyed we didn t use the restaurant for other meals so cannot comment on anything other than the breakfast all the staff were extremely professional and helpful nothing seemed too much trouble and restaurant staff are very efficient and attentive we would definately return and would certainly recommend this hotel i must mention the cleaners our room was cleaned to a very high standard as too were the public areas well worthy of its star rating
