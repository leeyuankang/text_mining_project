liked the executive room which was roomy with bathroom down some steps away from the room bed quite comfortable and cosy we had a very nice vegetarian lasagne the first evening and the waitresses were very friendly and helpful they serve a delicious very hot chocolate walking distance for hyde park and oxford street and very near several tube stations
