the hotel room was clean and from appearance this hotel is newly refurbished good facilities and the staff was quite friendly this hotel was among the priciest in the bayswater area and from appearance it gave the impression that the room rates was worth the money the rooms are just slightly bigger than your average london hotel rooms there is a flat screen tv but i believe it is not cable tv and the channel options are very basic very far even for my standards as compared to back home
