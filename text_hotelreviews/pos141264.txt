i was not impressed for i was required to pay extra for hot breakfast i have been in many hotels from to stars and never had this and the continental breakfast available was poor for a star hotel tinned fruit not acceptable i ordered a twin room but this was two single beds pushed together so extremely cramped although great location and hotel clean etc not value for money
