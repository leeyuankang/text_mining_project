the staff were marvellous nothing was any trouble and they looked after us superbly the continental breakfast was plentiful and delicious the croissants were deliciously buttery the bed was huge and very comfy the room can get very warm but there is air con to counter this the location is great beautiful area and a stone s throw from hyde park highly recommended
