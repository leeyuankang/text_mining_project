everyone was so friendly lovely relaxed atmosphere nothing was too much trouble for the staff food fantastic room really well equipped the fridge was a big plus and the shower although a bit complicated had a good pressure everywhere was so quiet and yet it s so close to shops the park pub restaurants and the tube i thought i had been spoilt by a night in the shard a few weeks before but this came pretty close
