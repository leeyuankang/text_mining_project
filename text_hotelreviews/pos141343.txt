the rooms were impeccably kept and the hotel staff were very polite and helpful a three minute walk from hyde park and about six minutes to the nearest tube the hotel is located in an exceptionally quiet part of london with relatively easy access the bus route also runs to bayswater road hours and runs right through the heart of london through mayfair oxford street and right up to king s cross will definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to friends and family coming to london in the future
