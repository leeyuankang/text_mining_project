we had a lovely room on the top floor and totally enjoyed our experience at the blakemore hyde the staff were very friendly and obliging and the location was a quiet spot just around the corner from the action the beds were comfortable and the water was hot close to central and district lines and bus stops including the big bus hop on and off the surrounding area is an interesting mixture of cultures and grand terraces
