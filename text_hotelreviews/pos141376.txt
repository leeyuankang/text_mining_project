we had booked a junior suite as we thought our grandaughter was going to be us unfortunately there were just two of us to stay at the blakemore we offerd ed another room on the ground floor that was much easier to use with a lovely bathroom however if you want a cab there are usually cabs out side if you ask in the hotel it will be a hire car very very expensive
