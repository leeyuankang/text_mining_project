spending four nights at the hotel gave me the chance to fully enjoy the room which was warm and comfortable and with fantastic views of the rooftops i particularly found the shower soothing due to the rain system as far as breakfast is concerned both meals and service were beyond excellence in conclusion i definitely recommend this hotel and will return in the future
