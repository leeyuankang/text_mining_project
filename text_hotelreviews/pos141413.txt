my husband and i stayed here recently and i must say it was excellent it was only a min walk from paddington with tube stations within a very short walking distance so great for location we were originally given a ground floor room that looked out at a blank wall not the view of london we really wanted however as soon as i said we really would prefer a different room the staff were very good and moved us straight away the staff were excellent throughout and our room was tastefully decorated with a large bed and a fantastic rain shower we only booked for the continental breakfast but my husband upgraded to the full breakfast for and had a beautiful big cooked breakfast too we loved staying here and would definitely use it again
