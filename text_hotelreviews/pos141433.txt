its hard to say what we liked about the hotel most as we liked absolutely everything when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade from standard room to junior suite the staff at the reception were extremely polite and fast both with check in and check out the room was cosy well equipped and quiet we also enjoyed the variety of food during the breakfast we would definitely choose this hotel for our stay again
