the personnel was fabulous absolutely awesome kind and helpful people nothing to complain about the hotel itself decor and tidiness etc breakfast was quite versatile even though me and my friend didn t eat the english breakfast but the continental one which includes a bit less than the english breakfast there are two tube stations within about min walk from the hotel i thought the location was good also the neighborhood is very calm maybe if you have disabilities or injuries that affect your ability to move the tube could be a bit closer all in all i d definitely recommend this hotel maybe not the ideal place for families with small kids only because the hotel is a bit finer and it has a lovely calming touch to it
