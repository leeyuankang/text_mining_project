great location and good value for the price rooms are a little bit on the small side but we did not mind you can hear the underground trains because the tube line is just behind the building but it was not worse than a normal traffic noise we had a room with the window to the street included breakfast was tasty and ok for the price overall the hotel has been clearly renovated already some time ago so some wear out is visible but the bed was comfy so that just added to the atmosphere of the area very nice and professional staff
