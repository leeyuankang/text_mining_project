rooms were very nice and clean with comfortable beds and a nice bath staff were very friendly and helpful after we checked in we found that there was no bath so we asked staff if it would be possible to get one this was absolutely no problem so we left our luggage and the staff changed room and took our luggage to our new room while we were visiting london
