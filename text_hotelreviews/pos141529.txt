myself and friends stayed for night at this lovely hotel the staff were so welcoming and friendly the location was excellent very close to hyde park we arrived at the hotel at midday before check in and we were allowed to store our bags in a storage room for no extra charge when we returned at midnight to check in we were upgraded and spent a very comfortable night the beds were incredibly comfortable the following morning at breakfast one of the staff very kindly crisped up some bacon for my friend i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again
