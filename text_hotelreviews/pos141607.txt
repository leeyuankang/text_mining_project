we stayed in a king suite and the room was very spacious clean comfortable and inviting especially for london bathroom was nicely appointed with plenty of space as well location was outstanding with access to tube stations and within walking distance to some of the best shopping tourist attractions sightseeing and great restaurants in the city i have stayed in london over a dozen times in the last years and this by far was the best four star hotel we have stayed in for the price i cannot comment on the food as we never took advantage of the free breakfast or other meals however the food looked great
