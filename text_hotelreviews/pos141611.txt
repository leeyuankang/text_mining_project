i loved staying in the green suburb of bayswater just a short walk from the beautiful kensington gardens for jogging or walking close to paddington station making the travel from heathrow airport quick and affordable very close to tube stations which is a quick tube ride to oxford street picadilly circus and bond street for shopping very close to portobello market and covent garden great central but quiet location
