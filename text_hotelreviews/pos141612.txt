the welcome we received at the blakemore hyde park could not have been warmer this welcome was continued throughout our stay by all the staff we came into contact with the room we were given we arrived a little early for check in so we were offered the room that was already prepared was on the lower floor we prefer a room on one of the higher floors so we asked if we could be moved the receptionist could not have been more helpful she explained that we would have to wait approx an hour but she upgraded us to make up for the inconvenience the concierge also took our bags and placed them in storage until our room was ready also took our bags to our room for us the food was excellent we never had to wait for service although it is an additional cost of per person to have an english breakfast a continental breakfast is included in the price it is well worth the additional cost to top our trip off we asked if the hotel would arrange a taxi to take us back to st pancras we were ferried back to the station in a private car belonging to a company working directly with the hotel so we didn t even have to wait longer than minutes to be on our way
