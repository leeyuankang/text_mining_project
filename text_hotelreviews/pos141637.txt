i have stayed before and always wanted to return the staff are friendly and requests are catered for i had requested an early check in but the staff said they were unaware they made a priority for us to check in asap which was brilliant i didn t like the pre auth hold of pp for extras such as room service etc as this is not mentioned on booking com upon booking and so i refused to pay as i was already on a budget and the staff accommodated that so perfect will definitely return
