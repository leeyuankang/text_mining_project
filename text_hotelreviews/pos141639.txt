i stayed in club double room it was of ok size for typical uk hotels it had plenty of amenities such as iroining board tea coffee machine etc i really liked that they had a usb charging portal for ipad iphone as i forgot my charger at home it was a big relief that i did not have to run around to buy another iphone charger staff was friendly bathroom was small but it was ok layout and a spacious shower cabin
