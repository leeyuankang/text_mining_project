the lication is perfect for restaurants bars shopping and theatre yet its not overcrowded the hotel is small cosy not pretentious but a nice touch of modest luxury bed linen immaculate and beds pillows very comfortable jewel in the crown are the staff get the impression they are happy in their work and they are friendly helpful we always stay here when in london if we can get a reasonable price
