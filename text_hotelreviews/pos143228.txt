i loved that they put the rose petals on the bed that i asked for and they brought my girlfriend a little cake as it was her birthday which they didn t have to do but it was very nice of them all the staff was helpful and friendly and i d definately be recommending this hotel to anyone who is going to stay in london thanks very much for the lovely time
