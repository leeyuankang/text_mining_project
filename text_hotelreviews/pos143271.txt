the staff was incredibly helpful hospitable friendly and professional they truly made us feel welcome and helped us in every way possible the location of this hotel is great just a minute walk from all the shops at oxford street en near various subway stations the hotel had a very luxurious and personal feel so we got a great hotel at a very fair price i would choose this hotel again if i were to stay in london city the only downside was the steep price of the wifi pounds a night
