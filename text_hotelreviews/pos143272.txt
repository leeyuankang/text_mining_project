the hotel was one of the best i ve ever stayed at in london everything was superb and i would ve given this a rating if it wasn t for the expensive wifi the staff were exceptional and the fact that i was upgraded to an executive room was so much appreciated that i ll definitely be back here in future i absolutely loved the bedroom and bathroom design the breakfast and the overall sense of comfort that was provided thank you so much for a wonderful stay i was under much pressure for work but staying at this hotel in its superb location helped me a great deal i ll see you in
