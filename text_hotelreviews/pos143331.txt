a very warm welcome on arrival staff were very friendly both in person on the telephone i arrived quite late at night having called ahead earlier in the day to advise and this was no problem at all i really just used the rathbone as a place to lay my head at the end of a very busy day of theatre with friends i d booked a single room i was pleasantly surprised at how much space was allocated the bed was dressed in spotlessly clean white cotton sheets big fluffy pillows an absolute pleasure to fall into after such a busy day bathroom was quite small a little dated but perfectly functional with very nice toiletries to hand no noise issues rare for central london although there was a big gap at the base of my door so unsure whether this might be an issue on other occasions i didn t get a chance to use any of the hotel s public rooms bars so am unable to comment in summary it s a very nice hotel at the cheaper end of london s accommodation perhaps a little dated but very clean friendly
