really beautiful comfortable hotel with excellent staff and in a great location it is walking distance to champs elysees but you ll need to take the metro to most of the great neighborhoods of paris not very much nightlife in the area something to keep in mind for younger couples this is definitely a quiet neighborhood but the hotel is lovely
