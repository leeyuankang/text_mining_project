loved that they used l occitane products in the bathroom the room and bathroom size is also slightly bigger than average for paris there s also a cute little balcony and the breakfast is standard good french pastries juices and coffee you can upgrade to a hot breakfast for a fee the location is excellent a min walk to champs lys es and min walk to any subway station a min walk to the eiffel tower a min walk to the seine and a min walk to the avenue with all the brand shops there s also a small vintage store next to the hotel but it was never open when we were there so not sure what the hours are it was my moms bday and they made sure to make it special for her the service was really good they sent recommendations before our trip which was great
