my husband and i stayed there for one night as a wedding anniversary getaway and it was just perfect it s a classic hotel with modern touches and a feeling of understated luxury we booked a deluxe double room online but then were given an option to upgrade to a larger newer room by paying around more on check in as with many classic hotels in paris some rooms haven t been renovated yet i suppose the beds are ultra comfortable the room was spacious with a small kitchenette and table and the service was great but the big plus of the hotel is its excellent location it s just steps away from the champs elysees and the arc de triomphe yet it is discreetly located on a surprisingly tranquil street we ve stayed there before in a suite with our two kids and were able to use the swimming pool and gym compared to other larger hotels in the area with similar facilities it s actually a good value you can easily pay double or triple the price for the larger flashier hotels in the neighborhood
