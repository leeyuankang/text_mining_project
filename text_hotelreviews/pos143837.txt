the hotel is a gem the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly the room was spacious and perfectly clean the bathroom was very modern and the bed was probably the most comfortable that we have ever had in a hotel despite being a little outside the center the hotel was a great base for visiting most tourist sites the pernety metro station is literally one minute away and offers easy transfers to many of the main lines we very much appreciated that the hotel offered a choice of a light breakfast and a fuller buffet while the hotel does not have parking we were able to find a parking nearby at a really reasonable rate using a parking app we will definitely stay here again
