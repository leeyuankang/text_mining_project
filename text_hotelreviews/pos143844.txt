nice clean hotel with very friendly staff small but perfectly equipped and clean rooms we loved the smartphone with unlimited call and data credit and used it all the time while navigating through the city looking for transport resto sights etc great breakfast you get to choose between an express breakfast croissant bread at the front of the hotel excellent value for money or a more elaborate and thus slightly more expensive buffet breakfast at the back great location a mins walk to the pernety metro station the district is very charming and quiet but still has lots of options for bars resto grocery shopping etc easily accessible by car there s no parking at the hotel but we rented a parking space just around the corner in rue d eure using the zenpark app and that worked flawlessly i definitely recommend this hotel and right now may prices are very reasonable though that might change since i understood from the staff that the hotel only just opened a couple of months ago
