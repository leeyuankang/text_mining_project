this is my new fave hotel the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly particularly with helping me to book attraction passes offer food recommendations and help me get my bearings my room was divine i loved the fixtures artwork and clever use of a small space and i had a beautiful view there is a gorgeous little courtyard for visitors to enjoy a light honesty bar coffee and croissant or in my case an evening byo beer with another indoor study area nearby the pernety station is a stone s throw away which easily connects you to the main part of the city however the area has stacks of delicious cafes and places to explore i will definitely be recommending this beautiful boutique hotel to others and hope to come back soon
