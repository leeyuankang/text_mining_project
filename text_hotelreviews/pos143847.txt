absolutely great kind and helpful staff the hotel is new and all furniture and facilities flawless the smartphone with free calls and internet was an amazing help for us tourists to fully enjoy paris and never get clueless we liked the bathroom especially the lighting in it tiny leds installed in the wall looked like stars in the sky the location is great a metro station is just a minute away there are restaurants shops grocery market and coin laundry nearby depending on your preferences and exploration style with good route planning it s quite possible to check majority of paris landmarks just by walking
