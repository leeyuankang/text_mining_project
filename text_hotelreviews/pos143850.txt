the hotel location is good very close to the pernety metro station minute walk some coffeeshops nearby quiet street the staff was friendly and helpful the hotel seems to be new or recently refurbushed and the room with a beautful decoration was nice not big nor small but nice for paris standards with a really very good bed the bathroom is small but the shower is very good and plenty of space we didn t had the breakfast at the hotel by option but the ground floor was nice with a small backyard
