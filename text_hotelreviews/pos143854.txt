staff are extremely helpful friendly and accomodating unlike most parisien hotels the hotel is recently refurbished to a high standard and so everything is spotlessly clean and works for parisien standards the room and bathroom was quite big and the bed very comfortable overall a very nice hotel and as icing on the cake it has the same name as me
