unfortunately we were not able to have any breakfast as we were catching the eurostar and had to be at st pancras by am the front desk tried to be helpful and hoped that we could be given a croissant etc if we went to the kitchen any time after this we did but all we were given was a packet of fruit and nut cereal and alpen each not a lot of use without milk
