the hotel is very very convenient to bus and trains with plenty of places to eat but if looking for good pub food the skinners arms in judd street recommended and basic pub food at mcglynns just around the corner in whidborne street with a lot less hassle and cigarette smoke the counter staff and kitchen staff were friendly and helpful and both times we stayed our rooms may have been a little unusual this is an old building but they were very comfortable and quiet and they have a lift we travelled by cab if unsure of direction but the buses generally were easy to follow the tube is good once you know your way around and the direction you want to travel a great address from which to explore london
