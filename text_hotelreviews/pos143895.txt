this hotel was perfect for a short stay in london that involves taking the eurostar and traveling with people that want a sure level of comfort and no surprises we adults certainly appreciated the big triple room no one had to share a bed or sleep on a convertible sofa and there was space not beds squished together room was also very clean and all the staff attentive and pleasant having a good breakfast included was a real plus i find every thing in london expensive so i did feel that value for money was pretty good being close to kings cross and saving the sweat of haulingbags long distances and the stress of catching trains on time due to trafic was worth the cost
