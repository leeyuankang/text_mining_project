location was primary selection criteria and was perfect from that point very short and flat walk from st pancras kings cross stations building is an old terrace very nicely modernised modern fit out good sized lift excellent facilities in room inc kitchen which would be excellent if staying several days bright clean kitchen and good continental breakfast don t know if all rooms the same but booking was for double suite which ended up coming with double bed and singles when all i needed was a double bed given primacy of location in selection and space quality of fitout didn t matter
