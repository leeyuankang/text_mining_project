the location was convenient just a few minutes from the train station the room was clean enough and front desk staff was friendly it is a great hotel to stay in if you only need a place to stay and will spend the day out the breakfast is free and was ok it was convenient to go downstairs and get a cup of coffee or toast before starting the day if i hadn t been traveling with a small child my rating would be higher
