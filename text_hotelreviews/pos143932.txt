close to kings cross st pancras nice clean apartment room had a mini fridge combination microwave kettle and cutlery crockery there was not a full kitchen setup like other apartment rooms this was just a kitchen area as part of one of the bedrooms please note there s no proper oven or grill seemed to be in a nice street despite people warning me that kings cross can be a little bit dodgy
