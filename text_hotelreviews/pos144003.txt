i got stranded in london due to eurostar cancellation after brussels attacks and got lucky suites were per cent off here and i got the last one a two bedroom suite for pounds literally next to st pancras staff welcomed me and took very good care of me which was needed in the circumstances i ve put a instead of a d on price quality based on their normal prices because the price i got was definitely a d but it was per cent off and then a instead of a d for the breakfast which wasn t bad at all but also not stellar perhaps a recent trip to france spoiled me for the croissants and baked goods but it was all decent and a good variety of things to choose from they were kind enough also to let me eat early due to early check in for extra securty checks the home i needed during two stressfull days i would definitely come again here with my family for leisure
