great location right next to kings cross station we were out in london for a hen party so the central location was perfect the staff were friendly and efficient on arrival the rooms were spacious and clean we had the larger suite rooms with kitchen facilities we were able to store our bags at the hotel for free the following day whilst we went out for a couple of hours
