pleasantly surprised as soon as we walked through the door friendly staff the accommodation was spotless everything in our suite looked brand new two rooms two tvs and a nice kitchen area with table and chairs very quiet with comfortable beds we have stayed in many of the hotels in this area but this is the best by far
