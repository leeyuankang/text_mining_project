the room was definitely not a suite and it was placed in the basement it consisted of three beds which was unnecessary i traveled alone there was a thin door which let in lights from the outside corridor all night the beds were comfortable and staff nice first night there were no towels in the room and somebody had used the bathroom without flushing before the suite was right next to the linen room so my guess was maybe the staff had used it and forgot to flush no matter what not too nice i appreciated the usb charger next to the beds and the breakfast was good the location too no disturbing traffic what so ever
