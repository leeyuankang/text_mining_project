we arrived in to london at kings cross the hotel was only a minute walk away so the location was excellent we arrived early but we were able to store our luggage the staff were very friendly and efficient the family room was perfect for us a couple with two teenagers with a double bed with an adjoining room with twin beds the breakfast was cold meats and cereals but a good selection overall it was great value for money i tend to find accommodation in the centre of london can be a let down but this exceeded our expectations
