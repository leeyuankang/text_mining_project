we were upgraded to a club room by the wonderful staff on reception after a little mix up and it was lovely the room was spacious clean and the little extras made it feel very special and added to our whole experience the breakfast was really good and beautifully presented the staff were very friendly and helpful overall a lovely stay thank you
