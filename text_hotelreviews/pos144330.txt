the hotel was in a fantastic location and only a minute walk to the nearest london underground station the hotel itself was refreshing and a polished appearance which represented its status the staff were extremely welcoming and happy which made the check in process that little bit easier during the stay they were also very attentive if needed and made for a comfortable stay the icing on the cake was the great price that was paid given the location from the natural history museum and south kensington or mins from hyde park
