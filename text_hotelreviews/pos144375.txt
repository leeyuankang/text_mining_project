the front desk was very helpful in obtaining a private driver to the airport this is a residential neighborhood with many restaurants nearby very classy neighborhood with a good vibe close to the tube and the victoria and alert museum and museum of natural history a mere minute walk to harrod s i did not decide to try the breakfast as it seemed more than i wanted to eat but i bought yogurt and fruit from a nearby grocery and kept it in the in room refrigerator i was given room which is considered a club room which had cozy bathrobes and slippers chocolates and bottled water although there was no view when i returned i was in room which was very adequate and had a window which opened giving a slight view of london very satisfactory and quiet
