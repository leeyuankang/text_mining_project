we were upgraded to a townhouse room on arrival and because i told reception staff it was our wedding anniversary they sent up a desert for us to share very thoughtful there was a mobile phone in the room which was specifically for us to take around london with free wi fi calls to the uk and many worldwide there was a super coffee machine the bathroom was great shower very powerful room very quiet despite being at the front there is a lot of attention to detail in this hotel and the porter who brought our bags was very attentive he showed us all the facilities in the main bedroom and in the bathroom we would definitely stay here again
