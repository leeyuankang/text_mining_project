the breakfast room was rather noisy as there was a constant banging and clattering of plates etc as staff were clearing replacing plates cutlery etc breakfast was luke warm which was a shame as it was quite tasty and would have been so much better if it had been hot it would have been nice if there had been some biscuits with the tea and coffee in our room we ordered a ploughmans sandwich which was brought to our room and despite it being toasted it was cold and appeared that it had been sitting somewhere before eventually arriving at our room and after having waited minutes for it which instigated a phone call to ask where it was it did not taste good
