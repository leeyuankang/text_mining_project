very helpful staff room very nice and spacious bed was huge and comfortable they offered to look after our bags after checkout whilst we went out and about again we just called back and collected them when we were ready then a staff member spent mins outside trying to flag down a taxi for us fantastic service just mins walk away is the science museum which is definitely worth a visit then next door to that is the victoria and albert museum a fantastic place to look around give yourself at least hours to have a good look so much to see
