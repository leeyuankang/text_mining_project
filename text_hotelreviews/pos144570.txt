everything in the room was spotlessly clean and the beds were among the most comfortable we have experienced in london during many short breaks the location in this part of london is ideal for the royal albert hall our visit was to attend two concerts at the bbc proms a five minute walk also the natural history museum is just at the bottom of the road and the science museum and the v a are just a street away it is also a relatively quiet area and once we were in the well sound proofed room we could hear virtually nothing outside also the staff were very helpful friendly and polite we will certainly stay there again for our next visit to the area
