excellent hotel easy to get to from heathrow as the hotel is only about a minute walk from gloucester road tube station the rooms were large clean very comfortable quiet at night and very well appointed i did a day trip with golden tours and was able to walk to their office to start the trip and at the end of the day everybody was dropped off at gloucester road tube station to make their own way back to their hotels i really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it
