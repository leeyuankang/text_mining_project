the hotel is not fancy but it is in a charming old london town home in kensington a ten minute walk to the gloucester street tube station and just up from gloucester road itself which is filled with places to eat and a hop on hop off stop the room was plain but clean and comfortable with a very modern bathroom the staff was helpful and friendly breakfast was not complimentary and on the high side so we ate elsewhere overall no frills but quite good for the price in a good part of london
