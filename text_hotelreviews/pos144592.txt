this is the time we ve stayed at queens gate previously we were just in a standard room whereas this time we stayed in club room the difference between the rooms was significant and helped us to have an even more enjoyable stay at the hotel this time the biggest bonus for us was the black out curtains which allowed for a really good night s sleep the bigger room and more spacious bathroom were also handy
