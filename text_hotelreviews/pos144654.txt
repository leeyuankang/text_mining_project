friendly pleasent staff nothing was to much trouble also the location was brilliant as we were there for a concert at the royal albert hall breakfast was very good with a wide selection of choice hotel room was very clean and beds were really comfortable also late check out is a good option staff even kept our luggage while we shopped in london for a few hours before travelling home would stay at this hotel again
