room was small and on top floor but we got a good deal and room was sufficient for our needs nice modern fittings and a huge bed did not have breakfast so cannot comment on that but we did have a drink in the bar after our show barman was professional plenty too choose from and prices no different from other bars good choice for shows at the royal albert hall as just a short walk away would stay here again
