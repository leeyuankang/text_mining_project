this hotel has a lovely modern design we needed a room for adults and children and loved that the kids had their own single beds our room was on and at first we were worried about being on a lower level but the room was extremely spacious shockingly so did have a large window so we didn t feel jailed in and had generous lighting through the room and by bed sides location was fantastic quick walk to gloucester road tube station or south kensington and museum of natural history is just a minute walk down the road the staff was friendly and helpful
