we stayed nights and had a very good experience staff at reception were very friendly and helpful when my wife suffered a fall on the first day of our stay and broke some bones in her right foot the staff immediately offered to provide a wheelchair when i asked about the price they said it was free which i found to be truly generous when it was rainy they provided us with sturdy umbrellas room service was excellent the breakfast was of very good quality the rooms were comfortable and well furnished my three daughter shared a triple room and found they had plenty of space the location of the hotel is very convenient close to bus and underground with lots of quality cafes and restaurants nearby we enjoyed our stay and will gladly return
