the beds were very comfy felt safe i loved the pillows the shower was hot and worked something which we always find to be a problem and for two sisters staying together it s great that we had loads of mirrors and plug sockets i knew i booked an amazing location but seriously this is the best location for everything i had planned tea and coffee and biscuits were replenished everyday and our shower condiments were as well which was lovely staff were friendly especially the cleaning ladies
