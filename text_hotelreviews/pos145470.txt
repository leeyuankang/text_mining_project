the staff were so lovely on our check in for our honeymoon trip we were kindly upgraded and they also added another lovely touch by sending us strawberry cheesecake on our first night the hotel is located in an amazing area with close access to so many places the bed was comfy a tad small but we re tall people and the bathroom was lovely and clean
