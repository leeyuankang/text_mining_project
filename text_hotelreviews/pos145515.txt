this is a perfectly located small central hotel less than walk from oxford circus it s in a great neighbourhood with some seriously good food and coffee right at hand it s very well kept with up to date interiors and unassuming staff the building itself is quite special and historic we got a super deal on our room rate with booking com highly recommended if you can get a good rate
