most of all i would say the staff especially the front desk would like to mention two members philippe and monika they were so charming helpful and good humoured we enjoyed chatting with them it was also very quiet in our room which was perfect but i understand another guest staying at the front of the hotel wasn t so lucky i know london well and that s why i picked leicester square as base location to show my granddaughter the city where i came from
