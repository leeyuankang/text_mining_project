excellent location courteous staff cozy room which was an upgrade from our booking due to availability very nice and clean rooms with views towards london eye and big ben there are restaurants in and around the hotel so even if you want to stay here for vacations with family it would best favor for yourself as you do not need to go too far to reach most prominent sightseeing places of london five stars
