the bed was very comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean on arrival the staff were very welcoming and the iced fruited water was most refreshing soon after arrival we had an unexpected birthday cake which was lovely the view of leicester square from our room on the third floor was spectacular especially at night several times one of the concierge staff went out in the cold and rain to get a taxi to collect us from the hotel entrance which was much appreciated i travel all over the world and have stayed in some magnificent hotels including the radisson blu in berlin kahalla hilton in hawaii and dusit thani in bangkok we had a pleasant stay in your hotel and must say your biggest asset is your staff who absolutely understand the meaning of excellent personal customer service they are to be commended a special mention for ryan in the restaurant who went above and beyond our expectations
