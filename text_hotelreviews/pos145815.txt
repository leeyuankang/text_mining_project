the bed was comfy the staff are great and friendly and professional without being overly formal personalities rather than hotel robots it was my second stay and just as lovely as my first stay the staff were so nice to my kids even when they were being naughty at reception it s a hotel you can really enjoy and feel at home the bar looked nice too although i didn t get a chance to go due to kids obviously the location is perfect too and nice not walking out onto a road with young kids also nice toiletries very happy customer
