fantastic location just a short hop to chinatown and shows room was lovely if a little on the small side but to be fair it is pot luck rather than design as on our last two stays we had huge rooms again a little pricy at per head for full on breakfast for continental but i have to say it is one of the best i have had anywhere you can eat up and not feel hungry till or so probably works out ok staff were lovely as always and could not have been more helpful giving us a later check out with no drama or cost also can i recommend a little place to eat just across from the hotel behind the m and m shop and w hotel a restaurant called lobster and hamburger fantastic lobster roll try it
