the concierge was fantastic went that extra mile for us bringing a black cab to the front door through leicester square so that we didn t have to walk in ball gown and heels at the salmon at breakfast was lovely tasting and fresh i was most pleasantly surprised with the lack of any noise whatsoever from leicester square we could see it but couldn t hear it
