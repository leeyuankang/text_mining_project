this hotel is in one of the best locations in london the staff are very helpful friendly and approachable especially andreae and annaise on reception the food we had in scoff and banter was second to none really delicious and again the staff are brilliant in particular ryan who was particularly helpful in securing us a dinner table before we went to the theatre and looked after us at breakfast
