visited london on many occasions and can honestly say i only used the metro from the airport this hotel is literally central it s perfect arrived late friday and was given room first impressions we thought the room was small for the price but was happy with the decor and cleanliness decided to ask if all the rooms were this size and was kindly moved to the next room room was very happy with this upgrade and the staff were super helpful didn t have much of a view but didn t really care and didn t opt for the breakfast either but really this hotel alone should be picked on location it s the best sleep comfort excellent
