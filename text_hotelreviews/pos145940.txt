staff were so welcoming and friendly from entering the hotel during our stay and leaving the food was excellent and the waiters were exceptionally good with the children the rooms were of a very good standard and even though we requested extra beds in the room there was still plenty of space to walk around with no health and safety issue i would definitely recommend and visit again if ever i am to stay in london again
