the room was fantastic over looking leister square to the front it was nicely decorated and very spacious the bathroom had good facilities and catered for your needs the mini bar was stocked well although you paid for the use of it the bar is worth a visit for the cocktails but in busy times you do need to book a table even though you may only want a drink the staff were friendly and very helpful recommended to any one with a bit of money because it can be a bit pricey
