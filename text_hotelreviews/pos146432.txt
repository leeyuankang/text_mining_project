wonderful attentive service amongst the best that i have experienced anywhere the concierge service is very efficient organising tickets for special events and for pre booking at art galleries and museums a charming hotel with excellent choice of restaurants lovely spa and small gym beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and choice of refreshments has a glamorous feel but still feels quite homely
