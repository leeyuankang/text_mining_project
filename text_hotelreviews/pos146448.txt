wow what an experience worth every penny having honeymooned in paris forty years ago we decided to return to the city for our anniversary and to push the boat out by staying here i can honestly say it was worth the expense and is by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in i had booked the cinq restaurant in advance for our actual anniversary meal and they had obviously passed this on to the reception team we availed ourselves of the offer of sedan car service to transfer us from the train station to the hotel and the driver who met us was super we were greeted on arrival by a staff member and taken directly to our room where a bottle of champagne on ice and a delicious chocolate cake awaited us the deluxe king room itself was beautiful tastefully decorated beautifully appointed and with a view of the eiffel tower the bathroom was also luxurious the staff were all fantastic and the service level very high we did not eat breakfast at the hotel but did have a glorious dinner in the cinq restaurant faultless in every respect the spa which you can use for free was wonderful we did not book any treatments but swam in the stunning pool and whirlpool as well as using the steam rooms and saunas situated in the male and female changing rooms there is a pleasant caf area too a great way to relax and not busy i like the way there is a facility for children to swim at certain times and then adults only time taxis are available outside the hotel the nearest metro station george v is close by on the champs elys es we were made to feel special by everyone at the hotel and my only problem is how i will be able to stay anywhere else in paris should we go back as it will be hard to match the quality of our suberb stay here
