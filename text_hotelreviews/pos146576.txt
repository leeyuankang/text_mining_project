first room we were assigned was not at all like what had been shown on booking com so we asked for another room it was so tiny two people could barely fit in it and no bath tub and was on the first floor so the staff upgraded us to a different room which looked a lot more like what we had seen online amazing much more space however the first room should not even be assigned to anyone if you compare with the pictures you should take new pictures so guests have other expectations staff very polite and helpful at all hours
