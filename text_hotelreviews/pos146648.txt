we went to this hotel as a group of friends for the london marathon the hotel is lovely not too big it s mins from marble arch and oxford street so really central rooms were new and spotless staff were excellent breakfast was great there is tech in the room to play with and they let us trial a new phone which was fun they called maintenance when my sunglasses broke wow will definitely be back x
