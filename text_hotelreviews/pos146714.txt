we have booked several london breaks last minute and this one was the poorest value for money to date the room was very small and not very comfortable for three adults as advertised i consider the room was adequate for persons only the room was not prepared adequately and it took hours for staff to respond to reqests to make up additional beds and to provide additional towels i would not recomend this hotel as value for money for a short break
