i loved absolutely everything about hotel fabric the hotel staff was friendly and professional and were very helpful in recommending a fantastic restaurant and assisting us in making reservations on our first night in town we also received a nice surprise from the hotel as we were there for our honeymoon much appreciated our room had a hip vibe and the bed was very comfortable it is in a great location in the oberkampf neighborhood there quite a few good restaurants and bars within walking distance when i come back i will stay here again
