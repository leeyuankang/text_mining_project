this is a true boutique hotel this is the place for people who want that little extra from a stay in paris spacious rooms with high ceilings really friendly staff that recommended great restaurants if it feels outside of the centre of paris you are wrong there are shops and restaurants everywhere if you don t want to walk take the nearby metro
