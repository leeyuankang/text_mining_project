what a truly wonderful hotel the staff are so helpful and friendly the decor of the rooms and lobby area so inviting the lobby felt more like a large living room where guests could relax rather than just come and go the honest bar is such a lovely touch there are several fantastic restaurants very close to the hotel that i visited were on the same street highly recommend
