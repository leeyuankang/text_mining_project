loved this hotel we only had one night but i would definitely go back the room was the duplex with the queen bed upstairs and singles downstairs i think it would have been hard with of us in the room for any longer as it was compact bathroom was great fabulous water pressure comfy beds excellent staff really friendly and who doesn t love an honesty bar free tea and coffee and snacks etc always available in the lobby
