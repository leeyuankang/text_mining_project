the staff really stood out at hotel fabric they gave us excellent recommendations and were incredibly friendly and willing to help a service that we sometimes struggle to find in paris the room was absolutely lovely as was the steam room the coffee is complimentary all day long and the lobby is a very nice space to have your morning coffee finally the location is absolutely perfect for anyone who wants to be out of the touristic center but still close to the action le marais republique and the canal saint martin are very close by for the most trendy and hipster spots
