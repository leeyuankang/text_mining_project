such a comfortable stay the pillows were superb we stayed in the juniour suite and it was such a beautiful and very spacious room it had a free standing bath tub which was amazing the shower was also fantastic the mini bar was also free apart from the champagne there was a docking station which we played music at the hotel is very artistic and has a great vibe especially for young people the staff were all amazing and very helpful it was my boyfriend s birthday so they even left him a card in the room the breakfast was great if you re searching for a quick and cheap breakfast it included french food too the hotel has a gym but we didn t attend the location is very much in central but it was tucked away from everything it wasn t that much of a problem especially for people who want to return to some peace and quiet fantastic hotel definitely worth the money
