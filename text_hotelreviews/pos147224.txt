the breakfast was really good for the parisian standards the cruvassant was great i loved the selection of cheeses and the geat thing was the buffet hours were very reasonable where as it almost finished around we stayed at a junior suit room and i really loved the confort of the room the bed and linens were really good quality and very extremely clean the towels as well the only thing that doesn t bother me but may others is that the two twin beds making one king bed i loved the extra black out curtains and how quiet the room was it made the environment perfect for relaxation after a long day of walk in paris the heating system worked really well and the staff was very helpful the only thing that did not looked to well was the connection of theain building to the junior suits which was basically a fire escape the location of the hotel was different than what i m used to as i m ard lover however this even beat the first by being equally close to all attractions like rue rivoli la fayette champs ellise concorde vandome just like a minute walk away madeline and opera was just a minute away also the hotel proving us bike to rent made our last day in paris unforgettable
