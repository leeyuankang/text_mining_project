we liked the location right in the heart of everything whether it s trafalgar square national gallery soho or piccadilly the cleanliness space of the room it was really big with big very comfortable beds the breakfast good the staff polite helpful my year old mother especially liked the little services in the room e g the personal welcoming note the pm tradition that the maid had to come to recheck the room get the bed ready for her sleep the interior ground floor was wonderfully designed to show a blend of the old world and the avant garde the library was cozy and fitting for a nice reading time
