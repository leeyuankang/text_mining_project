everything about this hotel was top notch the hotel is perfectly located near key attractions but not too in the middle of the tourist mess the rooms are elegant and well appointed with luxurious modern amenities the staff is attentive as suits the level a luxury hotel demands they went over the top in every aspect while it is not for budget travelers the value of the hotel is well beyond what it costs i will never stay anywhere else
