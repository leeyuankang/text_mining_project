booked the premier city view room room was great but the bathroom was insanely amazing having a bath overlooking the beautiful scenery was my highlight tv was a bit pants as there wasn t many channels and most didn t have any programme information but other than that it was a lovely stay staff treated us like royalty would definitely do it again if i can afford it
