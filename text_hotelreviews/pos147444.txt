it was my partner s birthday so the staff and i were planning our stay accordingly months ahead with dinner reservations and room bookings they kept promt with giving me replies and they were very helpful and polite however upon arrival the staff gave me a surprise and upgraded our room to a suite the gym and pool facilities are amazing and the toilets oh my gosh the in room toilets are amazing but the suite they had given us without any extra charges was the highlight it took my partner and i quite a few hours to just absorb all of that we had dinner in hutong which isnt part of shangri la but part of the shard restaurants but we got peckish after midnight so we ordered room service afterwards and even that was amazing thank you very much everyone
