we went for our anniversary and they upgraded our room one of the staff hand made us a card and sent up a special cake for us the staff were all very polite and helpful really excellent the rooms and facilities blew our minds we didn t think you could get things like that without paying huge amounts of money the view is extraordinary the best in london we did a lot of sitting at our full length and width windows and enjoyed the view a truly excellent all round experience i would recommend this to anyone even if you can t afford it save up for it just once it s truly worth it
