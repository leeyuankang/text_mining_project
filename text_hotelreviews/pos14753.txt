we felt so well looked after there are only rooms so you feel like you have the run of the place and the staff couldn t do enough to help we had a late saturday night dinner in the brumus restaurant which was also excellent the location is perfect very close to the theatres restaurants and bars but just tucked away in a quiet side street fantastic experience we have already booked again for december
