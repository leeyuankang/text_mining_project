the appeal of this hotel is that it occupies floors to within the shard the storey iconic tourist attraction on the southbank of london s river thames hence all rooms have magnificent panoramic views you can upgrade to get city views of e g the river thames westminster london eye tower bridge etc etc facilities within this hotel are on the more expensive side but offer a touch of luxury especially for that special occasion apart from being within the shard it is well located near the southbank for lovely restaurants and strolls along the waterside to the globe theatre art galleries the london eye etc it is opposite the interesting borough market and a short walk to london bridge including its underground tube station overall a very good experience
