swimming in the pool on the floor was amazing cocktail bar was great too view from the room were incredible and hotel was so quiet and peaceful for london welcome tea was a nice touch wonderfully appointed bathroom bathing while looking out over london was a rare treat and the all singing all dancing toilet added to overall comfort staff were attentive and efficient without being intrusive and the birthday cake was a lovely gesture
