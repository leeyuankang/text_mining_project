everything from the moment we stepped into the hotel to the minute we left we loved every moment me and my wife love luxury and this was a treat for her birthday we live reasonably close to london for a start so neither of us fancied going out so we stayed in the hotel the staff were amazing and friendly they couldn t do enough for us we ordered from the in room dining menu which was extraordinary we both had the burger on the menu and was astounded when i was asked how did i want the burger cooked around minutes later the food arrived and was pushed into the room by one of the hotel staff the trolley the food was served in folded out as a table to we were able to sit around this to eat whilst enjoying the london skyline the food was amazing i have never eaten something so delicious in all of my life i don t think i could have eaten any more than a main and a desert as it was so filling the rest of the evening was spent using the binoculars supplied by the hotel to gaze at the london skyline from our room you could see the southbank with the london eye staring back we could see big ben illuminated in the back ground st paul s cathedral was right across the river from us and we had a fantastic view of london bridge after a luxurious nights sleep in the biggest most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in we looked out over the morning london skyline which was somewhat more dismal and grey than the night before but being in the shard made the weather irrelevant we went to breakfast which was included in our stay we were greeted at the entrance to the restaurant and shown to a table the chairs around the table were actual armchairs we were asked to get our food from the buffet which was the usual egg bacon sausage hash brown etc the food again was amazing we returned to the room to pack our things everything had been amazing and was even better than we had imagined
