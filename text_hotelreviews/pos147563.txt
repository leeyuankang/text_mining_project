location is perfect as are the views as one would expect from such a building the staff were sympathetic and helpful if somewhat inexperienced was asked to choose wine for dinner before seeing the food menu which was slightly odd the dinner itself at ting was good although not exceptional the views from the infinity pool are however really special and spectacular
