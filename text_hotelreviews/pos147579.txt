we stayed for nights for our honeymoon the hotel all staff the facilities the breakfast spa facilities were all of the highest standard possible it was beautiful the gentleman who checked us in on the afternoon of monday then took us up to our room and showed us the facilities our bags were fetched for us a cake was brought for us to celebrate our wedding by your considerate staff nothing was too much trouble and this made our honeymoon your staff were very attentive to its guests the room was brilliant the view over london fantastic especially from the bath the only downside i think is that due to the price we would be unable to afford very often but we would enjoy when we could
