everything was perfect they also upgraded us as a surprise for my husbands birthday we had the most awesome views and the room was perfect we woke up to see the sunrise our stay was simply perfect and very recommended i recently stayed at the mondrian hotel priced almost the same for the room categories but in terms of service experience attention to detail and customer satisfaction this hotel by far exceeded that experience so much so we joined up to shangri la s loyalty program as i was really surprised we could still get such amazing customer service fully recommend staying here did i mention the phenomenal views
