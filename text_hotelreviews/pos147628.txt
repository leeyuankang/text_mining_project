the attentiveness of the staff made our stay very special we wanted a special location for our anniversary milestone birthday where our family and friends could join us from the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble our room comfortably accommodated our champagne reception before we enjoyed a fabulous lunch since returning home our grandaughter aged has written in her homework journal that the shard reaches up into the sky and it feels like being in the clouds it is amazing we think so too
