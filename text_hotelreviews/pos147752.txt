view across london from our room at night was amazing the room itself was very comfortable clean and had everything we wanted at breakfast there was a huge selection from the buffet or if that wasn t enough you could order from the menu the egg benedict was a great start to the day staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful and we would definately recommend eating in the ting restaurant we are already planning our next trip back
