brilliant location right next to view from standard double fantastic breakfast expensive but prepaid and was really worth it very high quality and plenty to choose from room was well insulated and quiet even though in flight path for city airport room and bed super comfortable very clean staff were very helpful this was an anniversary special night away and was really worth it we deliberately went on a night no concert on at the spa pool lovely and included in room price highly recommend and we will save up to go again next year
