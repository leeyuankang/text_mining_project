i adored this hotel probably the most comfortable hotel bed i ve ever slept in the rooms and the decor in general were cute yes the rooms are small but hotel space is crammed in paris so one lives with it the staff were really nice and helpful the hotel has a wellness area which we didn t try out no time excellent location and close to lots of restaurants and bars the breakfast was superb in my opinion the choice wasn t massive but excellent quality and it included smoked salmon yum although the tea selection wasn t good and my husband said the coffee was awful i d definitely stay there again
