this is a really lovely modern boutique hotel the staff are friendly and helpful but not at all intrusive the breakfasts are also very tasty with a good range of choices the rooms are quite small as other reviews say but very nicely decorated the beds are not small do remember to ask if you need your bed to be made as a double we didn t realise at first that most rooms can be prepared as two singles or joined and prepared as one perfectly comfortable double
