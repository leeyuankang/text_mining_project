being a champagne lover i loved the champagne theme as well as the champagne in the mini bar the actual champagne bar and the barman knowledgeable about champagne but in addition to that the location was great a minute or so walk from blvd saint germain and a convenient metro station the staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was good and plentiful although some variety from day to day would have been nice comfortable bed good wifi day spa and cleaner than i find most hotels to be and cleanliness is something i usually complain about will definitely be back loved it
