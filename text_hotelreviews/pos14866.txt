staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived the view from our room was incredible we were attending a concert and this was the ideal hotel for location when leaving the next day we were unsure how to get back to the station we cannot fault how helpful graham was with advising us to make the river bus he showed us on the map where to get off and was just generally a very nice helpful man thankyou for our amazing stay x
