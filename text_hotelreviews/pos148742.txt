this was the most romantic hotel we stayed in out of about hotels during our honeymoon the room had modern fixtures and felt very clean with gorgeous french personality we arrived very early in the morning and as such had requested an early check in but didn t expect it would be possible we were very pleasantly surprised to find the staff had gone out of their way to make this happen lovely to relax in such a splendid room after an overnight flight the location is also fantastic merci beaucoup
