this small recently modernised and charming little hotel is right in the heart of paris only metres from boulevard st germain many of the main sights of the city can be easily walked to it is surrounded by good restaurants and the famous cafe deux magots cafe flore and cafe procope are all within a minute walk while the rooms are small they are well appointed and comfortable and all bathrooms have apparently only recently been refitted and tiled the reception staff are effervescent to put it mildly and very helpful if the price of breakfast at the hotel seems steep as it did to us there are many alternatives nearby for a coffee and croissant some rooms like ours have doors to adjoining rooms that apparently can be opened up to make a room suite and the doors between block little sound our neighbour sometimes sounded as though he was in our room avoid these rooms if possible notwithstanding this small issue we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again
