great location approx blocks from river and luvee museum although museum was closed during our stay because of high water level in river lots of restaurants and shops near by staff was extra friendly and helpful for an older couple who did not speak french bathroom fixtures were modern spa tub wonderful after full day of sightseeing breakfast was good and priced reasonable mattress was comfortable
