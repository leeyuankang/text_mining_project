this hotel was super clean and efficient i d like to have had coffee making facilities in the room or downstairs free of charge considering the room rate i think breakfast should be in the room rate then encouraging guests to use the ground floor facilities in the foyer etc a little more i wasn t quite sure if the bar downstairs was for guests to use or not it would have been nice for this to be a little more enticing to sit at the end of a night out or have a drink before going out all in all location room staff were very good
