everything from the rooms to the very friendly and very welcoming staff at the front desk nothing was too much for them irene and anna were wonderful explaining everything both in english and french but mostly their smile and cheerful faces made us feel at home the rooms were very comfortable warm and airy and extremely clean the location was very central to everything we wanted to see and the hotel was classic thank you all
