very friendly staff every member of staff i came across went out of their way to greet you no matter what they were doing room was amazing views from the sky bar at night are brilliant sky bar was very busy no seats available at around so we stood at the bar but as soon as a seat was available we weren t forgotten by the staff i could not fault this hotel in anyway
