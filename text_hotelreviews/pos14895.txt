we were delighted with the hotel it was exceptionally clean friendly all the staff were very friendly and helpful mario gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an upgraded room he explained everything clearly we stayed there to go to a concert at the and it couldn t have been easier it made life so much easier to walk through the walkway straight into the and afterwards while everyone else were rushing to catch trains etc we ambled back to our room and the view from the front over to canary wharf was wonderful and we had a side view of the dome it was a delight we had a wonderful breakfast they had everything there you could want and nothing was too much trouble
