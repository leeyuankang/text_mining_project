the location is fantastic close to multiple metro and bus stops and on about a min walk from the eiffel tower the room we had was not big but very clean and the bed was very comfortable there was plenty of storage and the bathroom had all the facilities required the breakfast was delicious with enough choice and the staff brings you fresh pastry as soon as you take a seat they also have a small but functional fitness area staff was helpful polite and friendly definitely a great hotel to stay
