perfect location for our needs as we were visiting to attend the arena for a concert we were given an upgrade upon arrival and the two floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing outlook onto the river the breakfast was good enough staff very friendly the car parking charge was far too expensive for my liking but we had no choice
