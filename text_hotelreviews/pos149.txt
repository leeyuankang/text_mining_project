the style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom our kingsize was very comfy and spacious the hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings all of the staff spoke english perfectly just like most people in the city and i couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places hotel arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a minute walk from a tram stop to centraal dam square rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring it s also right next to oosterpark so i can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in amsterdam as it was mine
