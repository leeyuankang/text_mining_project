this was our first trip to london we could not have been happier with the location the breakfast buffet was great and was an easy convenient way to start each day though the room was rather small similar to nyc and par for the course in london the bed was comfortable room was clean and bathroom was nice the hotel is walking distance minutes to earl s court stop we walked all over but one of our favorite places was holland park which was a minute walk from the hotel the staff was really helpful and even held are bags for us after checkout until we left for the airport we would definitely stay in this hotel location again
