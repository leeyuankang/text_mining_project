i was very impressed by the welcome extended by the reception staff aijas and dave as we entered the hotel they greeted us warmly immediately offered us water when we told them that it took us ages to get to the hotel due to heavy traffic as a result of the incident on london bridge both of them took special care of us speeded up the formalities and aijas then escorted us to our room he showed us around the room and told us to call him if we needed anything i must say this was service par excellence much better than at any of the hotels with big names very personal service i would highly commend both the staff for their professionalism courtesy and friendliness
