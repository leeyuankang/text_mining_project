the room was very clean modern and roomy we were on the ground floor which made it very quiet and private with no passing traffic except the emergency exit initially i found the location a bit off putting being in a basement area but then i realized the advantage and really liked it the staff were all very friendly and helpful a real bonus compared to my last london hotel we also had dinner in the lounge and the food and service were excellent
