the staff were really lovely the concierges were very kind and helpful and all staff were friendly my room despite being in the basement and lacking a window was really nice the bed was very comfortable and a decent enough shower complimentary water and fresh fruit were really welcome a phone for non uk visitors was a really nice touch plenty of sockets and tech support in room too good free wifi that didn t require me selling my soul thanks i was given a late checkout as requested which was really helpful as i had a charity run that morning they were more than happy for me to leave luggage through the day location was excellent for access to the underground earls court and walking to kensington and surrounding attractions
