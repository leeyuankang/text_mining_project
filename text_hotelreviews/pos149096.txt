we were assigned a different hotel on the morning of the trip because there were maintenance problems at kensington we were sent to park grand paddington while this was a good hotel it was it in as convenient location for what we were doing the staff were fine but omitted to take our payment so we were locked out of our room when we returned after our day out we didn t think anything of not paying on arrival as many hotels including holiday inns do not take payment until you check out on our second morning our toilet cistern was continually filling but not retaining the water we reported this it had to use toilets a cross the road in the main building
