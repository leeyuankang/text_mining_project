the front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly it was my husband s birthday and they left a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in the room together with a card this was much appreciated the beds were really comfortable and both the room and the bathroom were very clean the hotel was less than a five minute walk to the earls court underground station which was convenient and in spite of being in such a central location it was very quiet overall we would recommend this hotel
