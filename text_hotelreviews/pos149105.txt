the staff was all fantastic really friendly and helpful i was visiting london with my sister and daughter to celebrate my sister s birthday the staff were aware of this and put a balloon and gorgeous chocolates in the room the room itself was large spotlessly clean and had everything we needed the beds were soooo comfortable i will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to london
