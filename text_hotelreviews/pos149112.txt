i booked at park grand hotel kensington and i came pretty late but they had that day a maintenance issue and my room was not available they booked for me at another location paddington and the staff aijaz as night manager and ravi at the desk was incredibly helpful to organize everything free transfer to and from the other hotel free breakfasts for the next two days so the way they managed that problem was a very positive service experience
