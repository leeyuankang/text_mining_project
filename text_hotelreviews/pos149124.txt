the staff were very courteous and professionally at all times throughout our stay we were moved to paddington on our first night due to maintenance at kensington unfortunately the room was too small there and staff were able to transfer our belongings back for us to stay at kensington as we were not happy to stay in a small room when we had originally booked a superior room at kensington we were upgraded to a club room at kensington which was lovely thank you x
