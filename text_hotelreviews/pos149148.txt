easy check in friendly and attentive staff including a phone call we received from the receptionist to the room minutes after check in to ensure we were satisfied with it though perhaps a more personal touch by door knocking wouldn t go amiss but that is just my preference and i expect others prefer to be left alone compact room size but clever use of space the complimentary fruit and water bottles are a nice touch as well as tea and coffee facilities the overhead shower was a welcome surprise and the bathroom and bedroom decor was first rate or at least what one would expect of a four star hotel the price we paid via booking was also very good value for money
