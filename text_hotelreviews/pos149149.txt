the staff were absolutely lovely everyone was warm friendly and really helpful they made the whole experience feel very personal even sending us a card to congratulate us on our recent marriage which was such a lovely touch the location is great earls court tube station is just at the bottom of the road and on the district line so really easy to get to central london too there are loads of restaurants bars and shops within walking distance of the hotel so plenty of choice we had a lovely time here and will definitely stay here again
