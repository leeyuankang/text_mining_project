we have just got back from our stay here in the park grand kensington everything was amazing the staff were so accommodating and friendly nothing was ever too much trouble we were upgraded due to it being my husband s birthday they put complimentary chocolates and a bottle of wine in the room for him too what a lovely touch check in was quick and easy and our room was ready before the check in time which was good although they were happy to hold our bags for us as they also did on check out day breakfast was very good a wide choice of hot and cold food available and it didn t feel crowded the decor of the whole hotel was very good and had a luxury feel about it it even smelt nice the location of the hotel was brilliant literally a min walk to earls court tube min walk to the museums and a min walk to kensington high street for all you shoppers we walked a lot as you see more that way the bathroom was very clean and toiletries were nice although could do with a bubble bath the hair dryer was a good quality we had lots of seating areas comfy chair sofa and other chair in our room which is always handy as you don t always want to sit on your bed we were out the front of the hotel as we requested as we like to see what s going on but was still quiet i would definitely book to come back to this hotel the next time we come to london as it was value for money but felt like a luxury hotel worth the it has been given
