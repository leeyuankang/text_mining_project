the cleanliness of the room was to the highest standard the room while small was extremely comfortable what i liked best was the room noise wise seemed to be very insulated you would hear nothing from the corridors at all this is i find unusual in hotels very often you are exposed to noise from both inside and outside the hotel this was not the case here at all which made for a great nights sleep excellent reception staff great location near the underground mins walk
