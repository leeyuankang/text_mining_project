stayed for nights from the of november really reccomend this hotel for top quality cleanliness and service in a quiet area yet close to everything you need the highlight of my stay was walking in the hotel door being greeted by a great man mr cornellio always happy hard working and offering assistance to me even on my rough days seeing him really cheered me up the hotel is a minute walk from earls court station and various fast food places making it perfect as a base for exploring london if you enjoy walking i found my minute walk to harrods pleasant and was even able to stop by the natural history museum on my way i would reccomend the full english breakfast for those trying to get a good meal in for the day ahead it was reasonably priced
