the buffet breakfast was very good a little pricey at only criticism was the lack of variety on sausages i don t like the herb irish sausages i prefer a standard breakfast sausage only the one option and at you should have a choice also the choice of potato was very limited too no hashbrowns but the pastries and cold selections were very enjoyable overall for breakfast nice clean restaurant
