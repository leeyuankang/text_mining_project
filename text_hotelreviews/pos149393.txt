the location was perfect a very short walk to earl s court station and within walking distance of some great restaurants the staff was very accommodating and even helped switch our room so we could check in faster we booked this hotel at a great deal and it was perfect for our vacation the room was small but we were expecting that for europe i would definitely stay here again
