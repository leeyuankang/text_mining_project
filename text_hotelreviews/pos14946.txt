the bedroom was spacious and comfortable particularly impressed with the bathroom that had a good sized bath and separate shower cubicle my daughter wanted to take home the pillows and duvet as she said it was so comfortable room had a good view out over the thames it was good to have the dedicated route into the which definitely saved time
