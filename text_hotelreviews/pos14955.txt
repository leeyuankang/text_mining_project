i am sure i rated this experience previously however to reiterate my partner amanda and i found the intercontinental truly wonderful we chose the option of club lounge access and although we did not have the time to take full advantage of its tremendous facilities on our next visit we certainly will the spa was superb the big bonus for us was the staff were par excellence nothing was to much trouble thank you once again and we very much look forward to our next visit tom madden
