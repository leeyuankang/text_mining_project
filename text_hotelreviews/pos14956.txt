you cannot get a better location if you are visiting the especially loved the private entrance straight into the arena only available for vhotel guests the hotel is simply beuatiful stunning my gosh it s extraordinarily expensive its more than some west end hotels with not the same attractions however we loved that kids ate free if you are staying in the hotel and their rooftop bar was breathtaking bedrooms were soo comfortable and with modern technology with their tvs and air conditioning it was a definately luxury if you want to treat yourself then stay here but value for money it is not it s for sure expensive but beauricular the staff could not be more welcoming and gave my son a little welcome gift as we arrived when i win lottery i will be back again
