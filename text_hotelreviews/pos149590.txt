stayed here this past weekend i ordered the deluxe room and got a free upgrade to the club room i was afraid the room will be small based on past reviews but club rooms are quite big too bad it was in the basement but since we spend most of our day outside the hotel it didn t make a difference hotel is clean and the room was good service was always with a smile location is superb minute walk from earl s court to the piccalilli and district lines also wi fi was one of the best i ve experienced in hotels super speedy and no dumb authentication required room tip go for club room if you can otherwise don t go for the basement
