the room and bathroom were clean beds were made daily chocolates service was prompt the price was great we got the room at the very end of the hallway which was very quiet the hotel is a min walk from earl s court tube which makes central london very accessible the station area has coffee shops a supermarket and atm machines would definitely recommend and visit again
