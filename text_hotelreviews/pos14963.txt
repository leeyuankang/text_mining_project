the room was amazing the staff are very helpful and the views from the sky bar are phenomenal especially at night we stayed following a concert at the and the distance to walk is negligible it is clearly sign posted and there is even a special exit to from the hotel for guests of the hotel which made it that little bit easier it has really set the bar high i m not sure there is a better hotel in the country
