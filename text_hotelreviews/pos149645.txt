the negative points mentioned didn t detract too much however from what was a generally very good experience huge room with spacious wet room nicely furnished and decorated and well equipped very large comfy bed convenient location earls court tube only minute walk away at the end of the road pretty quiet we were on floor overlooking the street worth paying that little bit more than what you d pay for a premier inn or travel lodge
