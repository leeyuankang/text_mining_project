the amenities in the room were great they provided toiletries and free coffee and tea although the coffee was of the instant variety but it still worked the bed was large and comfy in fact the front desk person had given me an upgrade to a larger bed and for that i am truly thankful one feature that was pretty cool was the status buttons in the room that let the staff know whether you re sleeping or if the room needed cleaning the wifi was fast and free the location was right down the block from the earls court metro station that can take you where you need to go rather quickly all in all it was a very nice stay in a very centralized part of london i would stay again
