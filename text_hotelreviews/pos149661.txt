we loved our superlative treatment by the staff at the park grand the location was excellent as well on a quiet street with a very short walk to the tube we never opened a front door during our stay since their gentlement were so quick to open the door for us the wifi in the rooms was excellent which was important to us and we were pleasantly surprised to find several outlets to charge our various devices that were both european and north american the rooms were very clean and were just like they are pictured the location was excellent since we were near earl s court station which had a tardis as well as starbucks a couple of pubs and good indian food all close by ruxi recommended an excellent rooftop patio for a drink as well that we loved we hope to come back soon since this combination of great staff location and price suited us perfectly
