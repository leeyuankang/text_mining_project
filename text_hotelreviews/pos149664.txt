the staff was very lovely and helpfull and always greeting with a smile on their face the location is amazing one minute walk to earls court tube station and various restaurants and stores around the neighbourhood as for the neighbourhood it is very quite we got a room by the street and had no trouble sleeping the rooms are small but that is a standard when you re in london beds were really comfortable and the selection of channels on the tv were nice if you decide to have a night in after walking around the city would definitely stay here again
