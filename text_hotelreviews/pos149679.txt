we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel the location is very good if you re flying to heathrow it s very convenient to take the piccadilly line straight to earl s court and take only a short walk to the hotel very friendly and polite staff nice little details like staff bringing chocolate to our room in the evening our room was clean and bathroom spotless all in all we had a very nice stay and i would love to stay here again
