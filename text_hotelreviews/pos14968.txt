very good staff room was a good size with a very comfortable bed clipper bar is a lovely place to sit and relax and again the staff were very good we had dinner in the brassiere restaurant and the food was good quality and again service was good we didn t know this until we checked in but the spa facilities are complementary so we would recommend using them
