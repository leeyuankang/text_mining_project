the room was kind of cold at first but i asked for the heating and they fixed it for me initially the window in my room was broken and the hotel kindly changed my room to a bigger one the location is great it is about minutes fast walk from earls court station also it is very safe around the area i returned to hotel at one day and felt completely safe
