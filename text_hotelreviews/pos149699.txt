the hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating nothing was too much trouble and they made me feel very welcome and safe the room was excellent very comfortable great shower the hotel itself is in a quiet street but two minutes from a major subway and loads of cafes bars and restaurants ideal for trips to london for couples or solo travellers
