loved everything about this hotel absolutely wonderful staff went above and beyond for us walked into a lovely room with a huge bed as we got a free upgrade to a club room the bed was comfortable and the room was clean the shower was lovely nice modern room no problems at all convenient as it is close to earl s court station just a minute walk will definitely stay here again highly recommended
