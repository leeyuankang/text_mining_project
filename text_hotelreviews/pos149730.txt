this was the first time we had stayed at the hotel chain it was literally a two minute walk from earl s court tube station with plenty of bars restaurants cafes and shops on the door step we found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly we were on an overnight stay for my husbands birthday and i am so glad we chose the hotel for our stay in london we were so surprised when we entered the room and saw birthday balloons and chocolates a really lovely gesture from the hotel thank you the room was spacious well equipped and spotlessly clean we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely recommend to friends and family would not hesitate to book again thanks again for a lovely stay and all your efforts were greatly appreciated by the both of us xx
