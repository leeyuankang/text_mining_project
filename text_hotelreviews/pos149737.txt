the staff were amazing everyone was friendly we had to be moved from one hotel to another park grand hotel when we first got there due to maintenance issues the transfer was very good the staff were very attentive we had to be moved rooms as the one offered to us was smaller than we expected and with my husband being very tall the staff understood completely we were offered another room which was perfect the location is great within walking distance of kensington gardens will definitely go back
