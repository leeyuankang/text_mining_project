easy to find hotel from earls court station even with a toddler in tow had a free upgrade to an executive room no bigger than a travel lodge so wouldn t want to see how small the standard room was staff lovely super clean hotel wish there was a lock on the mini bar as toddler was found several times with a kit kat from there lovely hotel with a great location would stay again
