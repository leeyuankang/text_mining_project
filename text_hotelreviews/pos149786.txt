location is great close to the underground and to the great kensington area it takes a minute walk to nice restaurants and good pubs the metro line takes you everywhere and is a minute walk for parking i recommend the q park queensway check google for the discount code the rooms are clean bed is comfortable and the shower is nice we didn t use the breakfast facilities due to the booking com pricing gbp for the two of us per day quite a lot for us eating a croissant and having a coffee we used the nearby pret a manger mins from the hotel at the underground access enjoy
