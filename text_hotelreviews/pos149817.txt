super comfortable and clean min walking from earl s court underground station the station has train lines which both go to the main attractions in london the room wasnt huge but fair enough for a young couple lots of facilities at the hotel i absolutely recommend it for everyone i had a special request to romantically decorate the bed for me and they did a wonderful job and they did it for free they put articialy petal roses on the bed and in the room and towels with swan shapes forming a heart and a chocolate box with also a eart shape it was awesome didn t eat there
