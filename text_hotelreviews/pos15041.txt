overall the room was fantastic the bed was extremely big and very comfortable we enjoyed being able to connect our phones to the tv to play music the sky bar on the floor was beautiful and the cocktails were delicious we had a great view from our bedroom across london and enjoyed watching the sunrise in the morning
