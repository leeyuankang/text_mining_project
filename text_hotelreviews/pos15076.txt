first time using this hotel and am not disappointed the room including the bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy given that the hotel was busy on the weekend we stayed the staff all had smiles and remained friendly and helpful the lifts were quick no long waits for one to arrive breakfast had quite a spread it has something for everyone loved having the back passageway through to so convenient and could come and go as we please during the opening times very useful to use to attend the concerts at the arena i hope i would be fortunate enough to stay here again
