after emailing the hotel with a pretty big request of preparing the room romantically for valentine s day using stuff that i had ordered to the hotel they set it up exactly as described in my email which was very specific as to where things should go and on top of this lina left a card wishing us happy vday and some chocolates the small touches made a big difference and i also thought the staff were so friendly value for money
