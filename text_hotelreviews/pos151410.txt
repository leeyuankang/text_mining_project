i loved it here i was stuck with two bad ankles and was really unwell the staff were so helpful and kind to me and went above and beyond to ensure i was ok one staff member found me crutches the other offered to book me in the single room for another night at a reduced rate so i could recover i literally couldn t move they also asked me how i was feeling the next day and brought me up some scones and tea it s really heartening to know that great service and genuine kindness exists and thrives here
