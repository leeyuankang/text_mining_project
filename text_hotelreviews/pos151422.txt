service could not fault the staff were amazing friendly and would do anything for you room service was spot on location was fantastic the scones in the afternoon were hot and delicious and free each day the drinks in the bar were not free as someone else has suggested it was an honesty bar so people should have paid for it really soft drinks were free of charge we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary and the staff went out of their way to decorate our room with banners balloons which i thought was really nice of them
