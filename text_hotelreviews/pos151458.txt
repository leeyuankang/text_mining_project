there was a discount on the room the room costs us only this price is impossible to find in any other hotel in the same area mins walking to harrods and mins walking to the middle of the knightbridge with this price made this short night journey amazing the staff were very friendly and the room was nice unlike many other big hotels in the area beaufort is very quiet and calming this was my visit to london but the best one of them and some of the favour goes to this hotel and its hospitality
