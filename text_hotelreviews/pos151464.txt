fabulous hotel in a quiet location liked that whilst the staff were there if you needed them they weren t in your face which i liked as it gave us privacy my only comment would be get that coffee throughout the night left on as being a terrible sleeper it would have been greatly welcomed at in the morning when there s not much else to do
