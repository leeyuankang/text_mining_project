a must place to stay if you are attending an event at the the hotel itself is fantastic modern and has a touch of quality compared to others the rooms are faultless with one of the comfiest beds i have ever slept in stylish bathroom with good shower not to mention the built in bose speakers in the ceiling they re quality cracking views over looking the river and the arena itself staff were also super helpful and approachable if it is the price putting you off don t let it its worth every penny would definitely stay again
