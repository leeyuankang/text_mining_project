absolutely fantastic place to stay me and my partner didn t want to leave the service was amazing so friendly and willing to help in any way to make your stay that much better we stayed here because we were going to a concert at the and loved the fact that you could walk straight in from the hotel the bedroom was lovely very high end finish and could tell that your comfort was top priority when it was designed and built talking about comfort the bed was the best iv slept in and when i got home my own bed felt inadequate will be staying here on my next visit to london
