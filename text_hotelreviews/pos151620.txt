the beds were very comfortable and the shower was very hot with good pressure they provided a phone with the internet on it free calls and a constant use of google maps make exploring the city fantastic as we never felt lost or confused as to where we were heading next great location next to metro line goes direct to and from guard du nord train station buffet breakfast was fantastic food was delicious and i love freshly squeezed oj so that was a bonus
