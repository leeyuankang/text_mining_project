by paris standards it s a great place small but super comfortable i liked that i had this feeling of a renovated space there which is rare in paris receptionist working there are extremely helpful and kind any interaction with them was a pleasure there is a room service too which we used on several occasions we will stay there again and recommend our friends and family to do so
