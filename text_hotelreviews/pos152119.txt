we loved our room good size room by paris standards we had a quiet interior room the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was perfect for one person and a bit tight for two but perfectly appointed with a tub and a window one big perk was use of a smartphone during our stay for free calls to the united states and within europe concierge service was friendly and efficient we loved walking around the area of the hotel lively cafes excellent coffee at malongo and delicious food at kgb conveniently located near notre dame and the louvre we will stay here again next time we visit paris
