the staff were so lovely friendly and very helpful and informative we liked that we were offered coffee and croissants on our arrival at check in and told that the hotel was our home for the weekend the jazz in the evenings was fabulous and the courtyard was a great bonus to be able to sit outside by still be warm in winter
