our room was exceptionally quiet and very comfortable it was a great place to relax after walking all day in paris a fabulous location this little boutique hotel is intimate and the perfect marriage of location quality and comfort the main rooms are beautiful from the jazz bar to the fireplace room which are decorated elegantly but is not overly ornate like some of the star hotels this little hotel has charm and is very romantic the room had a very comfortable bed bedding an umbrella which came in handy the one day it poured a safe for storing passports and jewelry a cell phone for our use with free international phone calls maps etc and little details such as chocolates with evening turn down service and a flower left in the bathroom a half bottle of champagne was left for us on our anniversary which was very thoughtful the staff could not have been more friendly and put up with our rusty french and spoke english when we hit a wall
