great location for the louvre notre dame palais du luxembourg and musee d orsay as all within a reasonably short walk the area has plenty of cafes bars and restaurants close by all staff were very friendly and the rooms and public areas were spotless our room was in the original century part of the hotel but sympathetically modernised it was nice and quiet at we both got a great night s sleep this is a great base for people who want to be out and about sightseeing and experiencing parisian life rather than being hotel bound as the hotel majors on service rather than high spec pools gyms and other leisure facilities it does have live jazz which was going strong when we got back at it was a saturday night and every table and bar stool were taken and you can t book in advance so get there early
