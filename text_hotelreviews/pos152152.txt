the staff were very friendly upon check in they gave us a tour of all the facilities and into our room upon reaching our room we were told they gave us a upgrade which we were very happy about there was a champagne waiting for us and the nightly chocolates which were yum the facilities though not as elaborate as a big hotel we were still very happy about because everything was just too pretty the beds were comfortable too and room was spacious considering you are in paris where almost all hotel rooms are small location is perfect too lots of cafes around so when we want to have breakfast elsewhere there are lots of options the hotel is very near pont neuf too and is just walking distance from notre dame cathedral
