the location of this hotel is superb it was my husband s first time in paris i used to live there and i wanted to find somewhere central so we could walk to most of the places we wanted to visit being in the latin quarter was a great spot for us and it s so close to tons of great restaurants some of them are quite touristy but you can find a few good spots that are more filled with locals the hotel itself is in a beautiful old building and the bar has live jazz music every night at least every night we were there our room was small but tastefully decorated and very comfortable the staff was very nice and helpful
