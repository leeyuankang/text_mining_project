as soon as you enter its obvious the interior is gorgeous the sitting room is breathtaking and it s great to have the heated courtyard which would only be better with a fireplace we took a deluxe double room which was spacious clean and also very detailed not a standard boring hotel room in the least the staff were all extremely friendly effiencent and accommodating we asked for quite a late checkout and we were so hateful that they graciously accommodated us sybille was so great in accommodating restaurant reservations as well we loved one of the main bartenders who felt like an old friend after a few nights they welcomed us with a bottle of wine the first evening which was a wonderful surprise and turned down the room with great care every night the neighborhood is great for access to museums bars and some of the best non touristy restaurants
