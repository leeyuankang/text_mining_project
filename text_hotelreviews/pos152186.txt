fantastic hotel every little detail was well thought about makes the difference great staff knowledgeable and helpful location easy easy access to all main attractions but in the heart of a great cafe and restaurant area would recommend this hotel over and over again use the concierge service to help book pre visit and during your stay it will help you make the most of your time interior of the hotel is truly beautiful pictures don t really do it justice
