a wonderful hotel apartment which was extremely comfortable and felt like home the staff were very nice and made us feel welcome and special right from the time we stepped in the bedroom apartment we stayed in was comfortably furnished and had all amenities that we required it was in a fantastic location just off ave champs elysee and also had a mini market right next door all in all this exceeded our expectations will definitely stay there if we visit paris again
