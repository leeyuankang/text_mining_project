even though slightly outside the centre we found the location a welcome retreat from the throng of the city centre there were lovely bakeries on the road and plenty of restaurants only minutes away the beds was very comfortable and the free soft drinks in the room were gratefully received we had the mezzanine room which was excellent as we travelled with children who had a floor to themselves all in all a wonderful experience the only words of advice would be that there was one small lift and a very tight spiral staircase something to consider for those who have difficulty walking
