loved the location we walked to many of the major attractions the met was nearby and montparnasse station was close for transfers the staff all spoke english and were very friendly and welcoming the free coffee and fruit in the lobby was a bonus there was seating in the lobby to have your coffee or read the paper fridge in the room was great
