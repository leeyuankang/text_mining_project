all of the staff were incredible nice with us rooms are quite spacious for what it is expected in cities like paris i booked last minute the day before and i was able to find a great deal price quality ratio couldn t be better if you arrive to paris by air by cdg airport or orly this is a good option once one of the bus stops for this airports is mins walking distance from the hotel
