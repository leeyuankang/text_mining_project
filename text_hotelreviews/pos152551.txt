we stayed in a floor mezzanine room which was ideal for our party of three children and two adults the room was spacious and comfortable plus well stocked with tea coffee and toiletries there were plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby and it was easy to commute to other areas from here we wouldn t hesitate to stay here again or recommend to another family
