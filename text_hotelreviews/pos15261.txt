everything is great here it s a new build light airy state of the art hotel but from a staff point of view it s like walking into any of the iconic fancy london hotels the staff are amazing and such nice people couldn t be more helpful the design of the room is thoughtful night lights bose speakers in the bathroom a shoe shine in your wardrobe latest tech so you can link your phone to the tv etc really happy with this hotel also the tea in the clipper bar is to die for even the basic breakfast tea tastes so good
