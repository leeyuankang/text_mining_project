lovely hotel and so convenient just a block away from the underground dlr although further from the airport mins from the staff were great naturally helpful informative and friendly without being false the room was small though beautifully designed and fitted pretty clean too apart from a few little corners perfect for a quick one night stay over i will definitely return
