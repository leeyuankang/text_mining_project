we arrived early and the friendly receptionists let us leave our bags in storage so we could explore london a little when we checked in and got to our room everything was spotless the bed was super comfy and the black out curtains were amazing you could control the lights from the tv and the wifi was very good the size of the room was cosy but not too small the shower was good and the bathroom gleaming overall i was more than happy with this hotel i would stay here again in a heartbeat
