the room was very comfortable good tea facilities in the room and lovely bathroom wifi was very good it s provided individually for each room so the speed is high the breakfast was delicious and had a good variety of foods drinks my room price included breakfast and dinner so i thought it was very good value for money i had dinner delivered to my room for no extra charge the food was delicious also there were a lot of high tech aspects to the hotel the best one in my opinion even though i didn t use it was a samsung phone provided with the room that had free internet calls and texts to uk numbers so if i was a forgein visitor this would have been extremely useful for navigation of the city etc as you can take it out and about with you while staying at the hotel i thought this was a very considerate and positive feature
