lovely hotel perfect location for arena was a minute walk to stratford station from the hotel and then took us less than minutes to get the also didn t take us long at all to get back to paddington the next day to go home there is a huge shopping centre next to stratford station too which has loads of places to eat and shop would definitely come back again
