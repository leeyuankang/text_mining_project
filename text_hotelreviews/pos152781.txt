my partner and i stayed in this hotel for nights from december staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble they recommend nice places to eat and places to visit the vip pass to the westfield centre was also a bonus they also offered to keep hold of our luggage when we checked out so we didn t have to carry it around london rooms were exceptionally clean and beds were comfy each room came with its own private wifi and a good selection of tv channels we did not have breakfast here however the staff allowed us to order a chinese takeaway to the hotel for the first night the hotel is a minute walk away from stratford station and it takes roughly minutes on the tube to reach central london the hotel was good value for money my partner and i both agreed that we would stay here again if we were to revisit london
