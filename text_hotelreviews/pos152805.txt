really easy to get to close to transport and visible on main street the hotel was clean and efficient and staff good unfortunately i had to leave too early to take advantage of the free breakfast the room was good modern clean and comfortable and the airconditioning perfect the tv was good size and well placed the use of mirrored walls made the room appear larger although near the street the room was very quiet and the bed comfortable
