amazing hotel loved all the technology and the modern feel staff were so friendly and helpful even offering to go and buy a bottle of wine locally as it is a halal room was great and the addition of a free phone to make free national and international calls as well surfing the net was a unique touch food in the restaurant from the half board menu was beautifully presented and tasty the teriyaki chicken was the nicest i ve had and the chocolate fondant pud oozed melted chocolate just as it should would totally recommend this hotel to anyone staying in that area it s only minutes walk away from stratford high street dlr
