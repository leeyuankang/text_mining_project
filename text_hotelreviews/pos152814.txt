i literally loved everything about this hotel the most nicest hotel in east london its round the corner from holiday in but i d choose this hotel a millions time once your in there the deco staff facilities everything makes you forget you are actually in london still min walk from westfeilds stratford their full english breakfast was amazing and so filling with a very decent price i could write so many good things on here but all i can say you will not regret staying or booking this place to stay oozes quality and comfort cant wait to be back
