very clean and quiet place wonderful staff at the front desk my room was bright and comfortable modern bathroom complimentary coffee tea and cookies every day daily housekeeping the electrical switches were a bit confusing for me free wifi in room the hotel is close to stratford train station with ease access to central london buy oyster card it works for trains buses the tube you ll need to enter only the zones not too many restaurants around limited choice of chinese mediterranean and local pubs overall i would recommend this hotel if you need to stay in this area
