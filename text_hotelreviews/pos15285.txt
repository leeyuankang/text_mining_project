we stayed as we were attending a gig at the and it was very well located for that and avoided the aggro of getting home an expensive hotel but good service comfortable rooms and bed two well located bars and a restaurant we enjoyed but was probably over priced a very enjoyable and relaxed even decadent over night stay and jess glynne was excellent
