really nice hotel staff very friendly and decorated modern located a short walk away from westfield and transport links rooms ok size and everything needed for s comfortable stay the only thing i didn t enjoy is the hard pillows but that s my own preference for a feather pillow saying that though the bed linen way lovely and crisp would definately stay here again
