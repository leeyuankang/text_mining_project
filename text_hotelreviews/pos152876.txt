the staff were so happy and helpful going above and beyond to ensure our stay was brilliant we spent christmas eve in the westbridge and christmas morning the staff made an exception for us to do a turn down service in the evening the room was fantastic breakfast was a lot better than i had expected with so much to choose from i would most definitely return again and stay in a junior suite again the value for money was amazing and the towels were so fluffy thanks again to all at the westbridge
