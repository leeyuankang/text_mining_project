i thought that the hotel was very good value for money i booked a twin room and was offered a double room at no extra charge for my own comfort which i thought was lovely the room was exactly as appeared on the internet photos and i was impressed by the computer system you can access through the television which allows you to control the heating lighting access the tv controls alarm clock and internet etc the staff were very friendly and helpful and couldn t do enough for you i needed to print a lot of documents to take to court with me the next day and they offered to do that for me and or said i was able to do that in the guest lounge and to say that was probably an usual request the staff were more than accommodating
