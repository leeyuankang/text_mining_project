second time we visited this hotel and loved it just as much the rooms are so modern and the toiletries are high range the hotel staff were aware it was our anniversary and they kindly upgraded us to a suite room free of charge we re very thankful for this and was so amazing to check in to that surprise when we arrived after a stressful time driving through london
