brilliant location very clean friendly and polite staff that couldn t do enough for you the large balcony i had was also excellent and a real luxury it was great to be able to get to the excel in such a short amount of time and with the westfields shopping centre nearby you were spoiled for choice with places to eat out or something to do in the evening somewhere i would definitely stay again
