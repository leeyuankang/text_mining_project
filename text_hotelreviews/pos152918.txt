loved the close proximity to the train underground shops the staff were super friendly and helpful the room was really comfortable and we loved the ritual toiletries there is a really nice guest lounge and the coffees at the hotel restaurant were yum wish it had been available for our whole stay in london and we will definitely stay there again when we return
