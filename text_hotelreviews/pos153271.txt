we stayed here as part of my boyfriend s birthday celebration and the staff at reception were lovely and attentive enough to greet him a happy birthday we were given a free upgrade and welcomed with a slice of birthday cake we were given a quick tour around the hotel by the lovely guest ambassador who gave us some history about the hotel the hotel has a great roof top bar spacious and quirky jailhouse bar a games room with ping pong tables and a bowling alley we were looking forward to using the spa swimming pool but unfortunately it was being cleaned when we were hoping to go our overall experience was excellent and we would definitely recommend and stay again thanks to everyone that made our stay enjoyable charlene
