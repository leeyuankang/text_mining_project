room was great spacious clean tidy and very quiet given its central location good facilities can t comment on food as we didn t take any there staff were generally very helpful and very courteous barring the check in experience mentioned above room service was quick to bring a spare bathrobe empty mini bar in the room didn t bother me that much as i had no need for anything but seemed unusual
