i really liked what they have done to the old courthouse and the police station the staff were very welcoming and helpful we had been upgraded so we had a huge room with a separate lounge the bathroom was nicely done the bed was very comfortable and we will definitely stay here again the room terrace was great too it was a minute walk back to the city in the morning sadly we didn t get time to use the pool which looked lovely
