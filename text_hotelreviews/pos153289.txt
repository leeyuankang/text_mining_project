the hotel was ideally situated for my business trip the facilities were excellent and the staff very professional in there approach to customer service all to often hotels are all about style over substance but on this occasion the establishment was perfectly complimented by its staff also for a london hotel the bathroom was roomy and finished to a very high standard
