excellent location although the room was at the rear and the view was of other buildings it was peaceful especially as there is a lot of nightlife in the area the refurbishment is of the highest quality and many original features of the building retained there was even a mobile phone in the room so you could make calls within europe free of charge the internet connection was very good large on the wall flat screen tv with satellite large modern shower there is also a swimming pool but we did not realise this before we arrived
