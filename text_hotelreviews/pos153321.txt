stunning hotel worth every penny i absolutely loved the jail house bar where the old holing cells remain intact the banksy s that are painted within are super cool well worth taking a look at we indulged in a few delicious cocktails i had the ball chain whilst we enjoyed looking around at all of the other pieces of art the rooftop bar has fantastic views over london when we used the facilities in the spar on saturday afternoon we had the whole place to ourselves not a single person on the whole floor i highly recommend this hotel will definitely be returning
