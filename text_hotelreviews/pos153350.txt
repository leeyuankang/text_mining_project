absolutely amazing hotel facilities were great too we were given a tour of the hotel as soon as we arrived staff seem to be very proud of where they work and can not wait to show it off we were given an upgrade which was an amazing unexpected bonus the room was just perfect the pool was also great very relaxing its somewhere you could go and stay for the weekend and not have to leave the building can not wait to go back
