staff assistance was always available welcomed every time we walked in very helpful and suggesting ways to make the stay extra special surprise stay for my boyfriends birthday got upgraded to a room with a view which was a nice surprise upon arrival good checking in and out times normally hotels don t give you as much time and the conscierge meant we didn t have to carry our luggage round london all day
