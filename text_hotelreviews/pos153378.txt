hotel is located right in the heart of the trendy shoreditch neighbourhood the hotel is newly converted from an impressive old courthouse i paid a bit extra to have a city view room it was very spacious large walk in shower and impressive views across the city i d recommend you do the same i didn t use the facilities but the pool looked good the bed was very comfortable the staff were all extremely helpful and attentive especially pierre the head concierge and his team i paid for overnight valet parking which was in a secure underground basement totally hassle free considering how much of a problem parking can be in london i was also surprised how quiet my room was considering we were right in the hustle of the city but i was floors up great stay and look forward to staying again would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to explore the great shops of shoreditch and around
