every member of hotel staff was friendly chatty and comfortable from check in the friendly conversation began which made us feel welcome miguel showed us to our room and was polite helpful and told us a little about the hotel which is always nice we had a fantastic room with an amazing view room the hotel even put out a little plate of dessert treats with a happy birthday message for my partner which was lovely room was spacious and well decorated with a comfortable bed which gave us a great nights sleep room was also quiet enough in the night although i m unsure if that was to do with being up on the floor location was brilliant right next to hoxton square and shoreditch high street bar in the hotel was well decorated with very friendly staff roberto especially was a superb cocktail maker and made some very good long islands for us in the evening impressed with the quirkiness of the bar but feel that not enough people know about it yet so the atmosphere was a little lacking however this will pick up in time i am sure roberto and roberta looked after us in the bar and we felt very comfortable chatting away to them all in all impressed with our stay and will definately come again
