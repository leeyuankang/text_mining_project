me and my boyfriend absolutely loved the intercontinental hotel i booked the superior king room after having read several positive reviews so my expectations were high and i was not disappointed it was our best hotel experience together from the moment of check in to check out never seen such polite friendly and welcoming staff before amazing customer service from the reception to the bar restaurant and the great spa facilities too it was his birthday so i requested for something special in the room and what a pleasant surprise we got the views the roses and even a free slice of cake which really made us feel special the bed is very comfortable the room impeccably clean everything is new and fresh very modern too we came back very relaxed and wanting to stay more what a hotel simply the best well done everyone i highly recommend it and will be spreading the word keep up the good work
