go for it a large modern quality upscale yet friendly hotel at a reasonable price for london a visit to the skybar is a must the breakfast buffet is quite nice too excellent welcome check in bravo to the young irish gentleman standard rooms quite small but impeccable and well designed ours had a view over the river and the skywalk five minutes walk from the tube line and surprisingly easy access from gatwick airport i would recommend this to anyone
