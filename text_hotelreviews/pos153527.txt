the hotel is chic and modern bed is comfortable the concierge and the doorman is incredibly nice and hard working and professional the day we left hotel there is a cycle event so the road was blocked and raining outside we need a taxi to get to airport but can not get it easily the door man and concierge staff was standing in the rain to help us to get one for more than mins then finally get one where the taxi stops at about from hotel so they have to push our luggage all the way to taxi my last time stay in london is at w hotel but i have to say the service here is better than w if you like similar vibe hotel but with more thoughtful service maybe this could b a good choice
