the staff really made my experience from the housekeeping to the front desk to the concierge to the amazing bar back who made the best drinks for me even though he wasnt a bar tender it was truly a lovely hotel and the location is super if you are a theatre going person and you love nice reataurants and bars there is nowhere else to stay it was perfect
