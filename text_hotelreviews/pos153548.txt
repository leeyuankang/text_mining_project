this was my first time staying at this amazing hotel and it will not be my last everything from the arrival to the departure was amazing front desk staff was so friendly and helpful i could not fault their service as it was my partners birthday i asked them to arrange a surprise we arrived in the room and there were cake and a bottle of champagne writing on the mirror with a personal message to add a personal touch to the experience i would lie to thank every single member of staff at this hotel for making the experience so amazing i will be staying again tip this hotel is very close to the novello theater so if you are going to watch mamma mia you don t even have to walk seconds
