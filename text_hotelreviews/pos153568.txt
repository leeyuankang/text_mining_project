my partner and i absolutely loved the atmosphere the staff were very friendly and professional which helped our stay at the hotel to be as comfortable as possible the facilities were very clean comfortable and stylish the service was outstanding i highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a break because it is in a good location and close to most central parts of london
