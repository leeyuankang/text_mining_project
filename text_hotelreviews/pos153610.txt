i booked a superior room with balcony as we were celebrating my husband s birthday the staff were very friendly and courteous and the room was absolutely amazing we had a complimentary glass of prosecco whilst checking in and when we arrived in the room we were greeted with a lovely bottle of champagne on ice and chocolates such a lovely touch we will definitely return
