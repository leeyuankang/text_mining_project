lovely location the entrance and reception absolutely stunning but our room was slightly disappointing couldn t open window air conditioning ok but got cold etc the neighbours had adjoining door and slammed it shut so many times that it made you jump out of your skin and at a group of men decided to have an argument in the corridor outside our door there wasn t a bath and after all our walking would have loved a long soak sandro made our stay special he had remembered us from our visit before and left us a welcoming present thank you you are a gentlemen a star look forward to seeing you again
