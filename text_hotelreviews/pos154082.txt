we really appreciated the size of the room thank you for the free up grade the bed was huge and very comfortable too we were at the front of the hotel and had three windows with thick heavy dark curtains great for a good nights sleep we were thankful for the fan as the weather was warm loved the location so close to russell square which we loved overall a nice hotel and a very pleasant stay
