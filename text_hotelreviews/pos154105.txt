the location is wonderful very central on a quaint street near the british museum our room was a triple on the ground floor with a view of the gardens behind the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by the lovely view of green vegetation it was late may which gave the room a more charming atmosphere than expected the room was very spacious room number and we were rather sorry to leave we were there night but would have been glad to stay longer the staff was very cheerful and helpful with a pleasant friendly vibe we arrived early and they promptly and efficiently stowed away our heavy bags for us so we could explore london until check in they were very responsive to other requests as well
