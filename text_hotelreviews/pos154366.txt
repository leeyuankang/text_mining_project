a four night stay and everything was absolutely fantastic nothing was ever a problem and i must say that the best part was certainly the service welcoming and hospitable staff everyone we encountered was friendly and well trained with a special mention of bubbly michela at the front desk and flavia in the restaurant who always answered our requests with a smile and they seemed to really love what they do if you re looking for a central location for a hotel with easy access to get around london you can ask for no better great location great value great service and an overall great stay nicolas braud the gm was on vacation at the time of our visit and the fact that the property ran so well in his absence is testimony to his leadership and an empowered team thank you for taking such good care of us
