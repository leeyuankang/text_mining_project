the hotel indigo is just a few minutes walk from earls court underground station making it very convenient to reach all of london s sights our room although compact was very comfortable with a large shower room there was a small fridge with complementary water soft drinks kettle with coffee tea biscuits this room was to the rear of the building so was very quiet the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful
