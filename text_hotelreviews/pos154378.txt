the staff were so friendly attentive and helpful the hotel had a modern feel to it and breakfast was amazing the choice was fantastic and so fresh earls court tube is a minute walk away and the bars and restaurants are on your doorstep yet the hotel was so quiet and relaxing very peaceful we would use hotel indigo kensington every time we go to london
