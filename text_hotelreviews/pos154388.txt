the staff were friendly and interested in us as individual customers nothing was a problem the hotel is beautifully decorated in a quirky individual style the atmosphere is laid back we loved the bistro where we ate in the evening as well as at breakfast the location is lovely we explored all the little streets and hidden passages in the area which looked beautiful with the spring blossom in full bloom we hired bikes nearby which was a great way to explore hyde park
