we like hotels that are small in convenient neighborhoods and the hotel indigo fits the bill the location of this hotel is perfect very close to the earl s court underground station which is on the piccadilly line which can be taken directly from heathrow the neighborhood has lots of pubs and restaurants the queen room we had was a little on the small side but always kept very clean breakfast is good with a good selection of hot and cold items to choose from we have stayed here twice and would do so again
