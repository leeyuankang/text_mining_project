perfect location for us at literally min walk from earls court tube station on the piccadilly line which is a direct line to heathrow so convenient the hotel was clean the room stylishly furnished we actually had an issue with the air conditioning in our room and the staff was extremely helpful issues can happen it s how the staff handles them that makes the difference
