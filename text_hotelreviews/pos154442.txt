this hotel is stylish and comfortable with several amenities you don t always find at other hotels little things like having free snacks and beverages in a well stocked mini bar that is refreshed daily is very nice to have we also encountered an issue with our room and the staff reacted quickly and moved us up to an upgraded room for the remaining days of our stay overall we were very happy with this hotel and would gladly stay here again
