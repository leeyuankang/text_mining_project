modern design throughout hotel rooms very well appointed and clean its a great location just mins from earls court underground close enough for a walk to the british museum and hyde park the staff are all truly excellent and were very friendly and helpful christina and osla zacarias in the restaurant also deserves a big thank you too as he was very quick to act when our baby choked and he helped my wife
