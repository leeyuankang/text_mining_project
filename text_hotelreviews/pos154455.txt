absolutely loved this hotel couldn t have asked for a better place to stay during our weekend trip love that its different with colourful furniture and quirky features the staff were so friendly and helpful the room although not massive was quiet comfortable and had the little extras of a boutique hotel robe slippers tea coffee iphone to borrow on your sightseeing the breakfasts were great too especially enjoyed the avocado and poached eggs on toast location is great not far from earls court tube station and great links into town also a lovely walk through chelsea and kensington into town if you prefer totally recommend staying here
