i am amazed by this hotel the localization is perfect just around the corner from chelsea and the tub station on earl s court plus it has a walking distance almost everywhere the personnel is highly helpful and nice always welcoming they made our short stay the most seamless experience of our life totally my new spot to stay in london plus the room was big elegant and so comfortable
