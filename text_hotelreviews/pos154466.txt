the staff was very friendly and helpful we really appreciate christina s service and warm personality the rooms were cosy and the bed was very comfortable a big concern when traveling we enjoyed the view of the garden and the proximity to the tube the restaurant inside the hotel was very nice as well we loved that we could have a lovely walk to high street kensington where there were restaurants we liked including whole foods
