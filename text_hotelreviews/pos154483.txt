beautiful quiet room we could move in to the minute we arrived no extra cost although we were hours early great service very friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed and well appointed room and bathroom hotel on a quiet street although only minutes from subway tube restaurants shops etc great location breakfast affordable and complete if you book the day before was great but also good options nearby
