we loved everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived the friendly staff couldn t have been more helpful the room and bathroom were spotless spacious and super comfortable the hotel continental breakfast is plentiful and includes boiled as you like them eggs the additional al la carte breakfasts are very large servings enough for two to share the location fantastic on a beautiful quiet street and just a few minutes walk from the earls court underground very convenient would definitely stay there again
