we have enjoyed our stay at this hotel the bed and pillows were very comfy location is minutes by taxi from the centre we didn t like the metro also it wasn t too close to the hotel kids loved the play area at the reception breakfast was ok i like the idea of boiled eggs the scramble eggs were awful also we had to ask for fresh milk for our coffee and they use powder in the coffee machine what doesn t taste nice the pastry and pancake section i would expect to be fresh but it wasn t freshly made we would come back to this hotel as its a good value for money and comfy
