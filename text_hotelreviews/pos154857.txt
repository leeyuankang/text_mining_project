the jacuzzi in the bathroom was the hotels saving grace and a brilliant touch as were the speakers around the room and bathroom the restaurant and bar was perfect food was delicious and the cocktails were made generously i will probably return just for the restaurant which is a lot more gracious at night than in the day the treatments in the spa were very good as were the spa facilities despite my gripes with the hotel which i detailed below the hotel is actually very good value for money i was just concerned that even in booking the second most expensive room in the hotel i had that many gripes for a hotel with that many stars
