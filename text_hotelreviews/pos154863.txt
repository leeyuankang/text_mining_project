excellent room but not overlooking the river thames the staff were very attentive nothing was too much trouble even parked our car for us in their under ground garage garage cost per night the restaurant food was very good and as you stay there you get a discount on your food bill a large starter was and my main a chicken dish was whilst my wife s steak was eating outside and watching the sunset was really very lovely experience
