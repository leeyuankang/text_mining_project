i booked double rooms and at check in they asked if we wanted an apartment this was great we had bedrooms bathrooms lounge with sky tv kitchen with fridge and utensils all set over floors with a great picture window overlooking the river being with friends all of us entered into the moonwalk this was great as we could sit around talking and getting ready it was so much more relaxing the hotel asked if we would like free transport to the moonwalk venue which was brilliant can t thank them enough
