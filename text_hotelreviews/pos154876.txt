the shuttle from train station was excellent though we waited at the wrong entrance as we hadn t been told otherwise i had asked for pillows which i was given when prompted i had mentioned in an email to the hotel that my husband i were celebrating our wedding anniversary when we arrived at our room we found chocolates red petals on our bed plus a note wishing us a happy anniversary but best of all we had been given a room with a view of the river i had asked if it would be possible but didn t it would be possible at the rate we paid that really made me happy as i had pictured in my head that we would wake up in the morning looking at the water and we did thank you so much the spa beautician made an excellent job of my eyebrows lashes she was super friendly explained everything she was doing
