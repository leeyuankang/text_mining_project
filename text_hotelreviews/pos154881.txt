i love the location it is so easy to find and close enough to central london the overall stay was lovely i surprised my boyfriend with a stay here in the deluxe double room which is huge defo worth the money upon arrival my room was not ready so there was a little wait unfortunately but because of this the gentlemen at the desk let us choose our check out time this was so lovely generally enjoyed my entire stay
