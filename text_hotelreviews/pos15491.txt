from the moment we arrived the experience was first rate leo i think offered a warm welcome and went that little step further than than usual check in you d expect the room was modern comfortable and spacious we didn t get to use all the facilities but the general assessment was of the highest quality throughout the staff were brilliant breakfast was like nothing i ve had in other hotels and everything in the hotel was immaculate we were visiting the for a lionel ritchie concert so location was perfect being literally next door
