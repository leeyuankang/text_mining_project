the first room we were offered on the ground floor was magnificent and huge but a bit on the noisy side as there were taxis pulling up etc i asked if it was possible to change the room we were offered a choice of two both lovely rooms so i chose the one i thought would be the quietest as my husband is an extremely light sleeper the staff couldn t do enough for us and were very pleasant and helpful at all times
