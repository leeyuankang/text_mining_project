the view depending on your room the tv in the bath the little luxuries like a bidet the spa facilities the sofas in the reception area i originally booked a premium deluxe double room which was on first glance really lovely with an amazing view but being on the first floor room you find yourself practically nose to nose with the passing public out below this room was also located with a view of the thames with a helipad spot as seen in the first photo upon further inspection i found that the tv above the bath was not working neither were a few of the lights which after almost minutes of trying to be fixed by the management team i was offered a free room upgrade to the nile suite room is above the restaurant btw not part of the main hotel area the nile suite is in the main body of the hotel and this room blew me away oozed grandeur stunning views all the glasses you d need without calling down to reception as the title stated if it wasn t for the free upgrade it wouldn t have been as good an experience and you get a free shuttle service to clapham junction station sidenote the french lady at reception in the mornings is so lovely
