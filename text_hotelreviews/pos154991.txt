this hotel is a little gem its location by the river thames makes it so peaceful so hard to believe that central london is a short bus taxi ride away the food in the restaurant is delicious and they do a wonderful breakfast menu too from check in to check out the service is first class and nothing seems to be too much trouble rooms are very comfortable this is our second visit and sure it will not be our last
