the location at the thames is really nice especially the view to the river and open terrace the service is friendly and try to help you everywhere in the third floor is the gym and spa area but don t expect too much it s quite small but sufficient the rooms are big and comfortable it depends of the kind of rooms but you need too search because in every category is a perfect room all in all it s really a nice star hotel for a good price in london
