a fabulous hotel reception staff were welcoming and professional our room was lovely with amazing views excellent air con system and great bathroom with separate bath and shower food was good and the covered walkway to the is really useful location couldn t have been better as we were there for an event the hotel is also right next to the thames path which provides a nice flat walk down to greenwich or in the other direction
