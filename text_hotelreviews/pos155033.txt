the hotel was absolutely fantastic very modern and nicely decorated our room was huge with plenty of room to swing a great number of cats i must remember to take some for my next stay the staff were incredibly helpful and even arranged for their courtesy shuttle to drive us to clapham common for the concert we were attending the car park is incredibly secure so i was more than happy to leave my new car parked there
