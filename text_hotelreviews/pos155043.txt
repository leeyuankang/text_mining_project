stayed for one night with a friend the room was beautful immaculate and had everything you could ever possibly need including the most amazing shower we were very lucky and ended up with a room facing straight out on to the thames which was the highlight for us it was stunning the staff were very polite and helpful at all times calling for taxis and sending the free shuttle bus to take us back to the train station we ordered room service and the food was also beautful although we didn t get into the restaurant we wished we could of as it looked and smelt fantastic will definitely stay again
