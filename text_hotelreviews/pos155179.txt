good sized room with plenty of space and an excellent bathroom which was nicely modern but water temperature was difficult to control the king size bed was one of the most comfortable i ve ever slept in battersea is conveniently situated for getting into the west end and to lesser extent the city but there didn t seem to be much in the immediate vicinity so not quite sure why it was built here but maybe things are about to happen
