the terrace overlooking the river thames was one of the highlights also from the a la carte menu but must have starter and main course makes the restaurant very good value and the food was excellent had a sandwich lunch they were excellent we took advantage of the offer at dinner and very impressed and then a lovely breakfast before departure drinks very reasonably priced too from the bar
