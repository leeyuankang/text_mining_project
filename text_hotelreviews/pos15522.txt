we were going to the for a gig and the intercontinental was ideally situated with it being right next door to the arena the covered walkway to the was an added bonus and hotel room to venue in under minutes was well worth the extra cost seeing that there was no queuing for transport had we gone to a hotel further out and the added cost thereafter which would have made a cheaper hotel in the docklands on oar on price to what we paid at the intercontinental but without the hassle the room we had was a superior king room suite excellent bed was comfortable room was spacious bathroom was superb after the gig we went to the top floor sky bar fir drinks with a lovely view of the docklands skykine only one complaint drinks were very expensive year old single malt and a malibu and diet coke didn t bring much change back out of ouch breakfast in the morning was exceptional everything you could think of english continental plus other items english breakfast was cooked well croissants and pastries all fresh we will be using this hotel for future gigs at the but will book an extra night in irder to take advantage of the pool spa and gym which we missed out on this time highly recommended
