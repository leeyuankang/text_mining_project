the actual hotel is beautiful the room was large and very comfortable the staff bent over backwards to make your stay memorable nothing was too hard for them the breakfast was plenty full and very tasty breakfast in your room is even more special and only tray charge which is excellent there was everything in your room that you needed for your stay i can t think of one thing that could be missing or needed it was very clean loved it loved the touch of smoking area on floor as far as i can see i can t find anything else that would be needed to make the hotel a huge success
