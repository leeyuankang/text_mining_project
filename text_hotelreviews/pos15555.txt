bed was very comfortable and cozy room was super clean and i loved the fact that everything was newly built staff were very friendly and willing to make guests feel at home location was great because it was only minutes by walk to the train station the jubilee line is so efficient in terms of going to other touristic popular destinations even if it looks quite far from the distance wise it only took about min by train to arrive at the most popular stations like green park etc
