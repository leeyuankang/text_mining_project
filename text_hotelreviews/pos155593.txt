we found the bed to be comfy but actually very short the breakfast was lovely however the lady on the restaurant was not friendly approachable or accommodating at all i asked if there were more fried eggs coming out the response to my question was you do know you have to pay extra for a cooked breakfast to which my reply was i asked if there were more cooked eggs coming out before she then proceeded to answer my question she wanted to know my room number she then went onto say breakfast finishes at o clock i am aware of this and this is why i came down to breakfast at i pointed out that i was aware of this and then went into point out that it was and therefore it is still breakfast time at this stage i was getting most annoyed and gave her final chance to ask the kitchen if more eggs were coming out she went and asked and then came to me with the answer and a slip of paper to sign for the additional cooked breakfast charge the question about the additional charge was never in dispute i just wanted an egg with my breakfast the reception staff were lovely and very professional
