we stayed for three nights in a club double room which was very compact but functional bar fridge was much appreciated as this is an absolute rarity in the uk the option of having either air con or open window was a plus staff were very professional and extremely helpful restaurant had great menu choices and all of the dishes we ordered were top quality prices of food and drink were very reasonable great continental breakfast which offered many options excellent location being only a three minute walk to paddington station which has much appreciated ramp access for passengers travelling with luggage
