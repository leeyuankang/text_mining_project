the hotel is a walk to paddington station and lots of eateries around housekeeping was superlative and beds were very comfortable the reception staff were very helpful too we were a family of and stayed in for the rooms n bathrooms were always very clean on our return each evening on our last day at the hotel i asked for an iron and since their irons were already in use and unavailable they sent me a brand new iron to use within a short time also although we had a night flight out of london the hotel graciously stored our luggage for us after checkout and later that evening when we returned we freshened ourselves in their spotlessly clean bathrooms in the lobby we will definitely stay with the norfolk towers again
