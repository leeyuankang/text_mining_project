staff were really friendly room was clean and comfortable breakfast was great lots of choice and the cooked breakfast is worth the upgrade from the continental option we had dinner in the hotel one night and the food was lovely if a little expensive but great food so no complaints location of the hotel is perfect for oxford street hyde park and all local attractions minutes walk from paddington rail and tube with plenty of restaurants and cafes around check out the pastries in bonne mouche
