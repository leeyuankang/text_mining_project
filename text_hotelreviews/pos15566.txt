we book the hotel over the internet a few days later we visited the and the hotel so i could get my bearings we ask the receptionist about parking i was under the impression that parking was free i was most upset to find that infact we would have to pay a fee of plus but because we were guests we would get a reduced price of wow for a room and then paying for parking car park was empty thank you very much after a wonderful stay in your hotel room food was great service was very slow on the floor cocktail lounge infact after waiting a good ten minutes with out service and no acknowledgement we left we were both looking forward to a cocktail but decided to retire to the bar on the floor great service from your staff also perhaps if you took away the bar stool away from the cocktail bar area we might have been able to get to the bar to be served regards mr mrs c dobson a return trip i would love at sometime but would have to really think about it
