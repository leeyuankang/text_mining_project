oh my the bed was wonderful both english and european electrical outlets and usb ports for charging i liked the lamp system where you could turn on sleeping or ready for cleaning when you went out for the day continental breakfast included maby not the most hearty kind of breakfast but it did the job and kept you full till lunchtime the location was great a short walk to paddington station multiple busses stopping outside to oxford st to camden town and a walk down to hyde park and marble arch the rooms were isolated and had an extra window pane to keep the sound out from the already quiet street outside we tried the restaurant downstairs the last evening ok food and friendly staff i decided to pay a little extra for accommodation on this trip and this hotel definitely was worth it
