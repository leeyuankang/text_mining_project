location is very accessible to both paddington and edgware tube stations plenty of food options around the hotel for lunch dinner including indian joints the hotel room was in a quiet zone they do so while booking when we mention we are coming for business so it was very helpful after a long day work to relax without outside hustle bustle helpful staff and a good breakfast spread overall quite a value for money hotel
