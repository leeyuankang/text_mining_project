we arrived and we re given a basement room i asked is there a window yes there was a window overlooking the firestairs the room itself looked nice but we could hardly move it was so tiny to use the loo with the door closed you needed to straddle to toilet or step into the bath and the noise throughtout the night was dreadful we think the kitchen area was above our room and they stomped around quite a lot night we asked to move rooms and were accommodated no problem both beds were like sleeping in a hammock far too soft and if your over your feet will hang out of the end good location clean and lovely decor just the comfort issue which let it down for us breakfast was included and was ok
