the hotel was a simple minute stroll from the front of paddington station in a seemingly nice clean and vibrant area of paddington itself the selection of both continental and english breakfasts were good and the english items sausages bacon hash browns fried and scrambled eggs etc were all nicely cooked and not slimey or cheap tastinng like most buffet breakfasts the restuarants food was excellent and flavoursome and the cocktails were reasonably priced and went down very smoothly we were upgraded from an executive double to suite for free which was a pleasant surprise and the room itself was all but faultless being near paddington station also meant being on the bakerloo tube line to take you to the heart of shopping in oxford and regent street sights of picadilly circus and links to other tubes all around london for whatever you fancy
