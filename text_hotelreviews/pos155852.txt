the entire days my girlfriend and i spent there were faultess and nothing less than perfect really the overall comfort and luxury of the place was lovely and made for a great experience and good nights sleep plus for the price we payed it was more than worth the money the optional extra full english breakfast was delicious and there was plenty of it left even towards the end of the morning would recommend on top of the free breakfast options plus the location of the hotel was really convenient given that we were minutes walk from hyde park and minutes walk from paddington station which was easy to then get about in london we plan to head back to london around the same time next year and we ll be booking with norfolk towers again
