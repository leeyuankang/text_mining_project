i was worried about the stay after reading other reviews but had no need to worry staff were very friendly the rooms were clean and perfect for what we wanted nice location near the tube station we left are luggage in the store this was really helpful breakfast was hot and plentiful would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again
