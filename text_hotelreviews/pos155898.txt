breakfast included in the price was great continental b fast was more than adequate cereal juices toast jam etc staff here very pleasant location was excellent paddington stn just a short walk around the corner which helped locating to sightseeing lots of great restaurants nearby especially the lebanese options cost of food in these places much better value certainly plenty of choice that u could get a different option each evening
