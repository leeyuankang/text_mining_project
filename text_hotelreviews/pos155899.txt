the staff were very helpful and attentive the room was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed for a one night stay location was perfect to be able to scoot over for an early start to hyde park for the royal parks run sat night we dined in the restaurant and were really impressed with both the food and service breakfast was also scrummy
