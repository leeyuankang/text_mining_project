the hotel s close proximity to paddington station was the basis for our choice to stay at this hotel along with the lift we requested a quiet room and it was very spacious compared to what you ll usually get in london with comfortable beds and well made headboards desk with an array or assortment of plugs for electronic devices there s a working television with a choice of good networks at no extra cost as well as closet that can easily accommodate four wheeled carry on luggage the bathroom was a dream all fixtures made of stainless steel good sized tub sink and toilet with tv towels and sheets were very clean we always bring our own set of toiletries so i can t comment on what was provided but the hand soap was good and made in italy not china the room had a hint of fresh clean scent wi fi a bonus a very welcoming accommodation
