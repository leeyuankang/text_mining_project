very nice hotel modern design and fantastic location staff was not very courteous and wasn t very helpful they wanted us to settle our night payment at check in despite a pre blockage on our credit card we didn t have enough pounds and needed to exchange euros or dollars to pay them the guy at the reception almost made us empty all our pounds not good customer service hotel is decently comfortable but basement rooms are difficult to get to and lift wasn t working at night
