used this hotel on two occasions good quiet location minute walk from piccadily station we have found the hotel very clean the rooms a bit on the small side but for the short time we stayed it was ideal very comfy bed lovely shower the breakfast was good plenty of choice of cereals fresh fruit meats etc would not hesitate to stay here again
