the staff were extremely polite and went out of their way to help us we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in and we were able to leave our luggage also after checking out we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel until our train left at p m in the evening a definite bonus we had lunch at the hotel which was very nice and once again the staff were extremely polite and helpful the room was very compact which we expected it was very clean plenty of hot water the bath oils and creams smelled beautiful and were of good quality the bonus for us was that the room was not overlooked and the sash window actually opened slightly at the bottom so we were able to have some fresh air in the room
