well located to the main attractions in central london and the flexibility to reach the hotel by public transport at different hours of the day were important to me my room was really clean and the staff were more than helpful throughout my stay would definitely recommend norfolk towers paddington to anyone staying for a short break in london it would certainly be my first option during my next visit
