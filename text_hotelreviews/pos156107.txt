myself and my boyfriend booked a night stay in london during half term we booked a few weeks beforehand and actually in terms of value for money this was great i had looked at travelodges in central london which were much more expensive and didn t include any breakfast staff were very friendly turned up prior to check in but we were able to leave our bags and venture off out into central london before returning about room was really nice very clean and great facilities bathroom was quite small but had the added bonus of a bath tub which was lovely nice to have a soak after a day of walking around breakfast was great as an added bonus very comprehensive continental and you could have a cooked breakfast for an additional hotel also let us leave our bags after we checked out so we could make the best use of our last day and we collected them a little later on
