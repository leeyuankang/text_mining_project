the beds were perfect no street noise at all the heating was able to be adjusted well to what ever temperature you like so many hotels in europe are too hot and you cant adjust easily the continental breakfast was wonderful and the staff were always more than happy to help and go the extra mile the concierge were very efficient and the porter excelled and gave us great local information we would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to friends the location to the hop on hop off bus is so convenient we also took a minute walk to oxford st paddington is a convenient location to all sights if you dont want to pay the high price of being closer in town
