everything was very clean and new what was really nice beds were comfortable the room was cozy bathroom a bit small but the shower was quite spacious and nice to use they have european outlets what is really convenient so you don t need to buy an adapter breakfast was nice you have to pay extra for full english breakfast but they are delicious the fruits they served were amazing the staff at the reception and restaurant are super nice
