friendly and attentive staff received free upgrade from a club room to a suite no prompting i would recommend a suite if you are staying for more than a few days very comfortable with plenty of space to lounge in very clean an additional tv in the bathroom was novel i have already recommended this hotel to my best friend i will be returning later in the year
