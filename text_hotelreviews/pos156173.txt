hotel was very easy to find on arrival staff were very helpful it s obvious that this hotel had recently undergone some major renovation the bar is not yet finished but that did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel breakfast was continental and a good variety of offerings toast cheese cold meats salami fresh fruit croissants and other pastries various cereals and also a gluten free option for extra one could have a full english breakfast which although i did not have this option looked very good the bed has to be the largest bed i have ever seen it s huge and very comfy bus stops are just a few metres from the hotel and are easy to understand for the number bus will take you into london city centre great eating places to be found near the hotel and very cheap once checked out we were able to leave our bags and collect them later on in the day prior to going for our train home i cannot praise this hotel enough although some may consider it a bit far from the tourist attractions i say give it a go you won t be disappointed it s only a minute bus ride away from oxford circus
