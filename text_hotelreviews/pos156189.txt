the hotel is situated near paddington station which is easily accessible to other parts of london the room was cosy and just nice for two people any extended facilities are one call away and the staff were really helpful the price for this hotel is not too bad and so far we had a really good experience staying in the hotel i would really recommend this hotel if you re looking for a place to stay in london
