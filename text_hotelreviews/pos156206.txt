the hotel is small each floor has rooms only very cosy very clean nearby everything very quiet despite improvement they are doing now the staff were very polite friendly smile all the time they have limited breakfast and there is extra charges of the continental breakfast for less than i recommend it and i will stay in this hotel every visit one night the siren fire alarm were on and this is a good thing as the hotel is safe and ready for any circumstances
