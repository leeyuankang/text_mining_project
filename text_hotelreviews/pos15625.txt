i took my friend on a surprise trip to see a concert we were fortunate enough to be upgraded which just made a lovely weekend perfect nothing was too much trouble and the staff have been trained to a very high standard the lady at breakfast even found a particular tea for my friend and came back to ask if she was happy with it small things go a long way thank you
