we stayed at the intercontinental for just the one night as we went to watch elo at the we did not experience any difficulties on check in and our room was ready for the check in time the staff at the hotel were impeccable throughout and could not have done anymore to make our stay more enjoyable our room was spacious and immaculately clean with great views over the river thames coffee making facilities were first class the shower had the biggest shower head i have ever seen and we both enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep we ate in the hotel bar before the concert and can recommend the fish and chips again the bar staff were attentive and catered for all of our needs following the concert we visited the amazing bar on the floor a beautiful place to relax and again floor to ceiling views overlooking the thames they even have an outside smoking area for smokers so it saves going downstairs floors to have one my only slight complaint would be that there were insufficient bar staff on duty to cater for the numbers returning to the hotel after the concert and we had to wait about minutes to get served a few extra bar staff would solve this especially when there is a popular event on at the the drinks are pricey so if you are looking to pinch a penny to save a pound then this hotel is not for you personally i would rather pay a little bit extra as for me the experience outweighed the cost considerably the next morning we went for breakfast about and did not experience any of the queues that some previous reviewers have mentioned a wonderful selection of pastries and everything you could wish for from an english breakfast before checking out we ventured for a swim in the indoor swimming pool you really must check this out during your stay as again it was a wonderful experience and the staff were a credit to the hotel
