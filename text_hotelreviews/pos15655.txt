i booked for my partners birthday and i can t express enough how helpful and sweet all the staff were at the reception and door helping me with the gifts and balloons i had brought along we had a nice spacious room with a bath and shower and lovely view and we absolutely loved the jacuzzi and swimming pool we went to the sky bar on the top floor and was lucky enough to get the seats near the window with a view of the city lights thank you so so much for such an amazing stay my partner said it was one of the best stays he s ever had and was a special experience for the both of us cannot wait to come back we re having a look already when we can book again extra big thank you to a member of staff called shannon for making it extra special
