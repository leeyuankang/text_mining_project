staff were excellent and always ready to help food tasted like it had been cooked and not warmed up like so many hotels plus you do not wait long in the restaurants because there are staff everywhere beds are comfortable even for sore bones and are very large rooms and bathrooms are excellent location for the cannot be bettered it s outside the back door however if going elsewhere tube not far away perhaps minutes walk so very good for central london very quiet no main roads going past so no traffic noise at night
