the hotel overlooks the river thames and the financial district so amazing views less than five minutes walk from the the decor is stunning and the greeting and reception staff were phenomenal particularly the smartly dressed concierge who took our luggage and made sure we got checked in two hours before check in time the superior hotel room was amazing spacious beautifully decorated and immaculately clean we even had a tassimo coffee machine the added extras such as cotton buds shower cap and hair band etc were a nice touch plus the variety of things in the mini bar too the tv was even amazing it had youtube movies and other channels plus all the hotel information including a little history of the chain room service menu breakfast and even your bill the room also had the comfiest bed i think i ve ever slept in our view was the building i couldn t have asked for a better room lots of facilities but we didn t get a chance to use them we also didn t make use of the sky bar but from what we saw it looked amazing the other really good thing was the hotel have their own access to through to the which means you cut out the walking round time and are under shelter aside from a second walk across beware though it closes at and if you miss it like us you have to walk the long way round
