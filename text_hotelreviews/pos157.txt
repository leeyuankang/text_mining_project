the only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks considering they have work going on location is great walk to tram stop n your in damn square in also we bought day travel ticket from the train station for euros n the hotel sell this for euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam only to and from airport
