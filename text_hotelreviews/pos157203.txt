in the arrondisement we were able to walk from the gare st lazare train station to the hotel about minute walk the hotel is on is very tranquil street with mainly beautiful residential buildings from the century we found about restaurants a boulangerie and a couple of grocery stores within a minute walk i get the impression this is a quieter section of town but restaurants were buzzing with activity hotel staff was super helpful and friendly the beds and pillows were comfortable the rooms are normal size by paris standards which means small but super quiet left too early in the morning to get breakfast but the minibar was free
