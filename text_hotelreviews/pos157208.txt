the neighbourhood of the hotel is very quite and safe we walked to opera louvre museum le musee d orsay only took us around mins the bakeries nearby provide very good bread and hot chocolate so we didn t choose the breakfast in the hotel the room was really nice clean and comfortable our windows faced the courtyard the shower gel shampoo conditions and body lotion are with very good quality we booked a standard room luckily when we checked in the room was not ready so that we got upgraded to the superior room without any extra fee we really appreciated the staff on this
