hotel was nice and quiet i could really get the home feeling here then we just came our room was upgraded to better one i guess they had few rooms left the room was clean and tidy bed very comfy where also was nespresso coffee machine and our mini bar was for free but the best part was bathroom and shower shower just amazing spacious with shower head from ceiling pressure like waterfall and water hot as hell just the way i like it we also enjoy the quality of nuxe bath products certainly the room was tiny like everywhere else in paris but with very good layout and furnishing so two people could easily move around at the same time with no problem and the temperature in the room was pleasant i could easily operate it by thermostat by the way our room had that big french style window to the inner yard so we could open it for fresh air to come and didn t get much noise from outside and still feel very privately in our room
