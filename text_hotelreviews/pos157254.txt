the hotel is in an excellent location less than a block from a metro two mini markets and a bakery this might have been the most comfortable hotel bed i ve ever slept on the staff was very helpful when we had problems using their computer and when we needed a new tv remote at hrs the shower is wonderful with a rain shower head
