my fiance and i love this hotel so much the receptionist was very friendly and helpful who was willing to share some info with us on the map though we didn t really need it hotel s location is great though not within the or arrondissement however there are a few metro stations nearby which make it a strategic location there s a supermarket and a pharmacy store down the street too hotel s room was clean and neat modern furnishing oh and they have complimentary tea and cookies next to the reception desk too highly recommend to those who want to stay at a nice pretty boutique hotel yet at an affordable price
