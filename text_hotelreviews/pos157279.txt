we booked a standard double room but immediately with our arrival we got an upgrade to a big room of approximately square meters the staff was very friendly and helpful especially juliana michaela dwane and roma location was excellent not far from the centre monmartre and arch to min by foot and close to two metro stations breakfast was excellent with very wide range of products we booked it included for half a price and it s very rare in paris the hotel is highly recommended
