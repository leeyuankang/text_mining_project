the staff were very welcoming and within five minutes of us being in our room we got a call to ask if we were happy with everything we got an early check in and late check out really lovely details in the room pool and spa both outstanding nothing to complain about at all and minute walk to the a real gem hidden out of site the bar was fabulous and we got a window seat looking out across the river and city views would stay here again would be a first choice
