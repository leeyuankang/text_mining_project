the location is amazing it is just minutes walk from moulin rouge also it is close to numerous restaurants and cafes the personnel are really helpful and friendly specially the lady chef at front desk the room was big and very comfortable the breakfast was ok buy it could improve by adding more veriety of food and beverages but i really enjoyed my stay over there
