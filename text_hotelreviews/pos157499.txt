we had the two interconnecting rooms which were amazing there was a fridge in both rooms our room had an en suite and there was a second larger bathroom there was a balcony in our room where we had a view of the eiffel tower the hotel is near the metro and moulin rouge when we arrived it was starting to get dark and i was not sure about the area lots of massage sex shops and we had a young child but the hotel was less than a minute away from the metro and is gated once you are inside you could be anywhere it really is very clean and lovely it didn t bother us that we were not in a more child friendly area as we only saw the outside for about two minutes everyday for us the access to the rest of paris and cleanliness were more important it was a very quiet room and we would not hesitate to recommend the only slight negative was the breakfasts were not great but we only ate there once as paris is full of lovely places to eat
