the staff made our stay as good as it was all were very welcoming and politie but diana at the front desk was particularly fantastic ringing our room to check everything was to our liking and leaving a personal note in our room wishing us a great evening at the concert we were going to the breakfast we had in the morning was also superb and we look forward to our next visit
