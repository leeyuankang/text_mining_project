what a wonderful hotel the owner and staff were incredibly welcoming and made our stay such a pleasure i m told they try to host a special event at the bar each week while we visited there was a whiskey tasting session each night for that week we learned a lot about whiskey and made some friends along the way it was such a memorable experience one we ll never forget the rooms themselves are cleverly designed and made excellent use of space while keeping a sense of minimalism highly recommended
