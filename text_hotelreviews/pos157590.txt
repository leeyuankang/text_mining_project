location was perfect it was minute walk from the eiffel tower and a minute walk to nearest metro station with links to all major sites the room was a good size and air conditioned comfortable and very clean it was modern with good facilities we paid extra for an eiffel tower view room and the view was excellent and definitely worth the money the staff were very friendly as well i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in paris
