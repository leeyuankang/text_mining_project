the beauty of this hotel was such an eye catcher the parisian decor was absolutely beautiful the location was ideal minutes from the eiffel tour we also took the fat tire tours which was also walking distance from the hotel say about minutes maximum let s talk about the comfort of the room it is small and compacted with all the necessities and clean the shower was my favorite part of this trip after biking and long walks around paris i was looking forward to the rain forest shower which is one of the two options available i would definitely rebook my stay whenever i m visiting paris again
