only seconds from the underground and even though it s situated on a main road we didn t notice the traffic noise in the room yes it is a small room but every time we have stayed in london the rooms have always been small we were concerned after booking this hotel as reviews didn t read well but we had no problems at all staff were polite and attentive room was clean location was excellent
