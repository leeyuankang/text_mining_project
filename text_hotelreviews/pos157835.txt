i nearly missed the hotel from the busy street as the reception is located in a cafe i didn t know what i was in for once checked in the room looked just like its picture comfortable bed modern clean facilities with wifi happy to have a quiet room that was not facing edgware rd it might have been a different story if my room faced the street very close to edgware rd and paddington train stations
