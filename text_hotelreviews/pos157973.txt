lovely breakfast with excellent variety in a modern setting and attentive staff easy quick check in and out with thanks to the very helpful and knowledgeable reception staff location fantastic very clean area and felt safe not too far from the tube victoria train bus station restaurants bars would definitely stay again and recommend but top tip would be to request a lower floor
