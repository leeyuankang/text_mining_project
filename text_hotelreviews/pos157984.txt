the property was in a safe quiet location with victoria station an easy minute walk traveling on public transport was convenient the greatest bonus was the complimentary use of a hotel handy while we were there it was equipped with data and google maps making navigating the city much easier and i was able to preserve data and battery on my own mobile the breakfast was locally sourced fresh and delicious a takeaway breakfast was even offered on the mornings we left the hotel prior to when breakfast was served i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends
