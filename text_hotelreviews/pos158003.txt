the hotel is located within a walking distance from victoria station it also takes min by public transport to get almost anywhere in the city centre the district is charming lots of small restaurants around no problem with that the hotel itself is cosy rooms are small but clean and nice the self service breakfast is very fair apart from it you may have a full english breakfast a porridge or a good granola for extra pounds the only drawback is probably the long narrow staircase if you stay on the top floor there s no lift that apart the hotel provides good value for money i would definitely choose it again if i need a place in the centre for days
