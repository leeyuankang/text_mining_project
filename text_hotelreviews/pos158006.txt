the breakfast is top notch a really lovely quirky restaurant with lovely meats and cheeses and beautiful croissants served with the continental breakfast and lovely staff also the cleaner was kind enough to let us have a peek at the wizard s chamber and it looks amazing i really like the bookcase door and how it is all done my children loved it i also appreciated the upfront communication from the hotel with directions invitations to drop off luggage etc it was really helpful being able to leave luggage at the hotel and when we checked in later it was already upstairs in our room really nice touch the reception staff were very helpful even trying to flag us a taxi the location is also fantastic we walked everywhere we needed to on the first day
