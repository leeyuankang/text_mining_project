smart yet quirky sophisticated yet not overwhelming there are quite a lot of stairs so a little bit of creativity with extra training i loved the character of the building and especially the original features that have been kept and still remain in the rooms the staff where friendly and helpful yet not over powering a good all rounder and good value for money
