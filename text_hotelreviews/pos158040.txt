the hotel is situated in very close proximity to victoria train and tube station which makes travel around central london very quick and easy as it is so closely situated if you fancy walking to close attractions like buckingham palace or hyde park this is also possible only taking mins the hotel although very close to the business of central london is located on a quiet and pleasant street the continental breakfast is delicious and the breakfast room is lovely the bedroom was a good size and i liked the decor in the bedroom also
