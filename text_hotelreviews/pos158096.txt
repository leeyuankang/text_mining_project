good hotel clean fair price comfortable a solid hotel facilities are fair by which i mean good and perfectly acceptable but this is not and it is not especially standing out as a memorable or boutique experience best part was breakfast which was an impressive continental cold spread with room to upgrade pay for cooked breakfast that was very good indeed and great location perhaps my problem was expectation management photos are especially grand but hotel has nice rooms in an otherwise straightforward terraced house in pimlico breakfast staff very good front desk staff weak and more self involved than customer focused if you stay there you will be perfectly fine just don t invest a lot of expectations in the hotel itself
