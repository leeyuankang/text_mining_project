i loved the hotel it was in a good location for us as we were down for trooping the colour the decor throughout was done to the highest standard the rooms were compact but had everything we needed the guys on reception were so helpful and friendly i can t thank them enough breakfast was scrumptious will definitely recommend and be back if ever i m in london again
