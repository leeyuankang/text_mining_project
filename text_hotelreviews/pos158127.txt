this was a great hotel and what made it extra special was the staff we arrived with our two son and daughter and grandchildren aged and and the staff on reception were brilliant with them one lady immediately occupying them looking for things on maps we were lucky enough to be there for an investiture and the staff did everything they could to help us storing our luggage hat in huge hat box included allowing us to change back into our ordinary clothes afterwards keeping the luggage again and joining in our fun when the men in the party had the hats on after our return from buckingham palace the staff are an absolute credit to the hotel i am sure they regularly meet guests heading for royal events but this didn t stop them from sharing in our excitement and fun thank you to all
