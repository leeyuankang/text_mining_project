this is a very quaint boutique hotel in a very good section of london walkable to restaurants buckingham palace hyde park most other tourist areas require transport underground is about a minute brisk walk which is the best way to get around london authentic d cor friendly and helpful staff fabulous included breakfast and worth the pound upgrade if you like hot items london is expensive so i think overall price was very fair for the lodging
