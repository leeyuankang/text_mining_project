this hotel is something very special the staff treated us like vips which we re not from the moment we walked up to the entrance to the moment we left the room was beautiful with the biggest most comfortable bed i think i ve ever slept in the walkway wasn t open to the yet but the hotel laid on a shuttle service however to save us waiting the very nice concierge called claudio drove us there personally in a bmw after the concert we had a drink in the bar on the floor overlooking the river and the lights at night a magical end to a magical stay thank you to what i think is one of the best hotels in london
