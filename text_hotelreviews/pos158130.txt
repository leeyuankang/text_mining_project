the room was spotless the cleanest of any hotel i have stayed at in london all staff i met were friendly polite and eager to assist when i realised that breakfast was not served early enough on my day of departure they offered immediately to prepare a grab bag of drinks and continental breakfast items this turned out to be fresh croissants muffins fresh fruit etc and was handed over in a sturdy cotton linen tote which will come in handy for other purposes as a bonus really well thought out and a great attitude to service i will definitely come again when i need an ad hoc stay over in town excellent
