this hotel is actually in several upper middle class victorian era town houses bought up and divided into hotel rooms rooms are in buildings that are not necessarily contiguous desk staff was accommodating and helpful super convenient location five min walk to victoria train and tube stations bed was very comfortable location was quiet which for a city like london is important good restaurants a short walk away decor was nice and things were clean and in good repair nothing was shabby or failed to function our grand kids and their parents were able to stay in the harry potter room expensive but really cool as one turned on the trip
