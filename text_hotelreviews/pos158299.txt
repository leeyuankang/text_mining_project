hotel s location is excellent they gave me a boulevard facing room which i had requested earlier at the time of booking i had originally thought that a sq meter room would be small and not comfortable i was a little surprised that it is not so although you it is a little cramped with the furniture but overall consider all aspects it was comfortable their staff are was very polite and helpful wish they increase their numbers considering it is four srar property whose major front office functions including concierge functions can not be left to single purpose at the reception
