the staff were lovely but after booking i messaged the hotel through their facebook page explaining that it was my husbands birthday surprise weekend and could they arrange to have a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room i can see that they had read the message so didn t think to double check but unfortunately they hadn t arranged this and for the cost of the room it was extremely pokey with stains on the ceiling and urine stains all under the toilet in the tiles
