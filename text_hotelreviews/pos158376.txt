it is a beautiful hotel both the lobby and the room are updated and gorgeous the interior walls are furnished with a thick sound absorbing material it makes the room very quiet bed is comfortable the breakfast was one of the best pretty convenient location it takes about minutes to walk to the nearby tube station
