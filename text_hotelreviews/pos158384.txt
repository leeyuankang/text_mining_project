the location was perfect for me the hotel staff were polite well informed courteous friendly and simply just down right as good as it can be the room was to my tastes clean with a good work space comfortable chairs with excellent wifi the bathroom was clean bright with all the attributes and facilities one wishes to have a trifle on the small size but i wasn t intending to have a a dinner party in the room so ideal the hotel just oozed quiet quality quintessential english from the moment the taxi door was opened by the doorman the rest just flowed like a dream
