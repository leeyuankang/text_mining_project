it was just a cute hotel and just what we needed being on our honeymoon the staffs really friendly and helpful they left us little gifts throughout the week we did stay in a suite and it was perfect the location of this hotel for the price is really good we have been to london a couple times before and really liked this hotel and location the room was always clean not stuffy everything worked great and the room itself like the hotel had its own charm
