from the moment our taxi drew up at the front of the hotel we knew that we would enjoy our stay here the doorman was there instantly to open the taxi doors and extend a warm welcome to us the hotel is fabulous and the staff really do pay attention to every detail as it was my boyfriend s birthday there was a cake and a personalised birthday card waiting for him in our room a lovely touch the bed was really comfortable with sumptuous bedding you could really snuggle into even the slippers provided had more padded soles that you would normally get the bar area is cosy and the cocktails and service superb great piano playing too really great location and really quiet at night in the hotel info they tell you some of the history about who used to live in the different houses which now make up the hotel a very enjoyable read would definitely stay again
