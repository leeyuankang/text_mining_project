my husband and i booked this as a christmas present for each other and we had a lot of trouble booking and ended up being asked to provide the card details we were going to use to book by email which was very scary and we ended up wanting to cancel the team at the hotel turned it all around and reassured us it would be ok they included a complimentary breakfast and upgraded our room which really helped change our opinion we will definitely be recommending the hotel to our family and friends and we will be returning thanks for making it such a lovely christmas present
