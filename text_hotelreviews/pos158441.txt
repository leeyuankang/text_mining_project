this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed besides the normal cons of a good hotel such as location service etc this hotel stands out as it pays attention to details and really think from a guest perspective to make your stay comfortable each room has its own decoration with good taste and they offer turn down service which is not quite usual for a star hotel and they offer you the facial mist which is quite handy in europe as it is usually quite dry at night and do include breakfast if you can choose this package full english breakfast is amazing they offer hot dish like egg benedict freshly cooked from the kitchen plus small buffet for bread and cheese cereals etc the last hotel impressed me in a similar way is penisula highly recommend everyone who stay at london downtown to try this hotel
