really fantastic location with lovely surrounding super close to the backingham palace hyde park busy but cool piccadilly street direct piccadilly tube line from heathrow airport what saves a lot of time during busy traffic hours i had a clean cosy room though be ready that rooms in london are small but that hotel has well equipped rooms tea coffee facilities iron super slippers with thick soft soles bath robes and even an eu socket type comfortable beds very friendly and guests oriented staff i was given first a room with a poor view on air conditioners block but after addressing this to the reception they upgraded me to a better and absolutely lovely room so i did enjoyed the visit and also thanks to such a comfortable accommodation
