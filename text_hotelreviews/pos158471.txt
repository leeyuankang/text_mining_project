on arrival i received an upgraded room to a double from a single which was a great start to the stay the staff were very polite and well organised even when faced with an extremely difficult guest on my first night who spoke terribly to some of the staff members for no fault of their own the bar team james and antolio were great very friendly and both were good company whilst i had some time in the bar making me feel extremely welcome during my stay food was excellent and the breakfast was fantastic my room was large and comfortable very quiet and made for a perfect base to go to work from with all of the nice extras provided like slippers and dressing gowns the location was perfect for my meeting on st james square but it is also ideally located for some high end shopping on bond street and fortnum and masons with plenty of places to eat ranging from the restaurants on curzon street to chinatown which is only minutes walk i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel and will be staying there again for any further trips i have within the area
