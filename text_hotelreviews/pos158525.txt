loved the quiet location and the coziness of the hotel the bed was very comfortable and the linens nice there was great lighting especially in the bathroom which often is not the case as a female traveling alone i felt very safe and the neighborhood has good coffee shops take out places a juice bar and mini mart within a block would definitely go back
