well i ve never wrote a review before but i thought i m going to break that rule because this hotel was absolutely exceptional from the moment we pulled up to the moment we pulled away the experience was fantastic i booked the weekend as a surprise for my partners birthday and all the requests i made happened but on top of that the hotel staff also added their touch by sending my partner a birthday card cake up to the room which was amazing such a caring touch the room itself was beautiful so peaceful the bed was massive and so comfortable it was the best night sleep but i think the biggest positive about the stay was the staff they were absolutely amazing so polite so helpful they were more like old friends then staff just incredible i can t rave about this hotel enough from someone who don t do reviews take it from me this is the only hotel worth staying at if your busting london and your looking for the extra touch of class
