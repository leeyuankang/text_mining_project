we had rooms as we were taking my mother in law to the for her birthday treat the staff were wonderful making a real fuss of her they brought her out a selection of free cakes after our lunch and because the connecting walkway to the arena was not ready yet and she has mobility issues they laid on a complimentary taxi to and from the show on our return to the room she wasn t able to climb onto the beautiful big bed so they brought up a smaller bed for her and made it up within minutes priceless
