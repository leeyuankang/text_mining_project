it s right in the heart of chelsea within walking distance of iconic shopping areas museums public transport and lots of good restaurants staff couldn t do enough for you really made us feel welcome and valued shower was very good we drove our hire car in to deliver the luggage before dropping it back at heathrow and getting the tube back in it s a bit far to wheel largish bags from the station there is no parking on site the rooms and lift were a little bit larger than others in the price range but not much value for money is hard to determine london is not cheap
