i have stayed at the hotel twice love the hotel the staff are fantastic and the rooms comfortable they can however improve on the breakfast they have exactly the same thing every day and the choices are too limited i think a simple adjustment to create some more variety in the breakfast menu would be a huge plus for the hotel the chef needs to be a bit more creative no one wants to eat the same thing day after day
