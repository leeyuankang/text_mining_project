i thought the first room i was allocated was very small although the staff member said it was the level of room i had booked he gave me another room which was double the size and a better layout they are in the process of renovating this room wasn t renovated but the bed was comfortable it had large windows i could open it was a pleasant roof top outlook the hotel is very close to the south kensington underground walking distance to kensington gardens kings road harrods museums etc a brilliant location
