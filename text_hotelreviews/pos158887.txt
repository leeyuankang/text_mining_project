great location for south kensington tube station lots of restaurants around and about we didn t opt in for breakfast as we found a good local cafe the street the hotel is on is nice and quiet for an inner city location and was very clean and comfortable for two of us in the room a bit pricey for what it was for one night but that s london for you and it is a lovely area
