we loved the location chelsea it is a very nice and safe area with pretty houses the staff was friendly and helpful all the time especially eddie the breakfast buffet is open from it is a small buffet but the food was good the tube is only away which was awesome as well it doesn t take you long to get to the different spots in the city around the hotel there are a few caf s and restaurants i would really recommend this hotel
