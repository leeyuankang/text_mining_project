the hotel is new rooms are spacious compared to london s tiny hotel rooms very well decorated clean the toilet is new and clean as well the bed is very comfortable sheets are clean and crispy the location is excellent minutes walking from south kensington station and few minutes by foot to sainsbury s starbucks and a pharmacy there are several restaurants nearby but you have you to find them as the hotel is not on the main street i would definitely stay there again
