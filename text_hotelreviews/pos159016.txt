excellent place for an overnight stay absolutely spotless with comfortable bed convenient for lots of places and the tubes i hadn t realised that breakfast was extra and a whopping each luckily we hadn t booked this as we were still full from dinner the night before lots of lovely breakfast cafes near the station though we d definitely book here again
