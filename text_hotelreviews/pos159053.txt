the bed was very comfortable and the decor of the room and hotel in general was very nice there was a good range of toiletries hot drinks and they even had things such as slippers vanity kit dental kit shaving kit and a little pad and pen which i thought were nice touches there was also a very tastefully stocked minibar which was quite reasonably priced
