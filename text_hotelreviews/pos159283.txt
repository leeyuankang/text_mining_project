the staff was very kind and helpful however the room we first checked in had a horrible smell in the bathroom the sewerage or something stank like a swamp we told about it to a night receptionist he kindly gave us another room but forgot to tell at the reception that we moved next day our room was not cleaned at all which we then resolved at the reception again i do think the hotel is nice but with so many problems and room conditions no daily change of tea coffee shampoo toothpaste but it is definitely not stars i don t know who gives the stars in france but it just doesn t reach the level according to basic criteria for stars it is quite a nice and cute place to stay
