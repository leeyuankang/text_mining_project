the location of the hotel is awesome and i paid a good price for a star hotel in paris the staff was very nice and pleasant especially the person whom i believe was the manager who drove me to the airport the room include conveniences like ironing board and coffee which you usually do not find in paris hotel i would go again assuming i can get the same price
