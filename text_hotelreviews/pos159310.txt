wonderful staff quiet area no noise from the streets we ate breakfast at the hotel on our busiest day and we were alone in the very romantic hotel restaurant the breakfast was like most hotel breakfasts nice with a jacuzzi in our bathroom many cafes and restaurants in the area metro stop metres away a two minute walk to watch the eiffel tower and maybe ten minutes if you want to walk all the way to the tower
