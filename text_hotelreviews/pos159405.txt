we had a wonderful extended stay at this hotel everything felt luxury and looked newly renovated the bathrooms were brand new with a very good shower large rooms by european standards and the beds were quite comfortable we had a balcony room for some of the time and it was so beautiful and lovely to sit out and look over the paris rooftops i choose this hotel in part because it looked close to everything and i wasn t disappointed steps from opera and big shopping district just min walk or easy bus subway ride to tulleries and the louvre staff was super friendly and all spoke excellent english definitely recommend
