the staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants each evening they also gave excellent options and directions in assisting me to get to the airport they were very pleasant to work with and my lack of any fluency in french was not a problem here the location was very central to all the sites i wanted to see for my first trip to paris wonderful pastry shop across the street to start my explorations
