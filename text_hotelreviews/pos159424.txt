firstly if you are coming from cdg airport the roissybus arrives about minutes walk from the hotel strongly recommended the hotel itself is spotless and welcoming in a reasonably quiet side street given its central location the room was large and comfortable and the bathroom modern and extremely clean breakfast in the room was excellent although we did not try the breakfast buffet our room had a small terrace definitely worth the extra if the weather is likely to be good plenty of places to eat within five minutes of the hotel and close to printemps and galeries lafayette for some luxury shopping or just looking we were also able to leave our luggage there on the morning of our departure since we didn t need to get the bus back until midday
