very beautiful hotel we took the junior suite and it matched our needs perfectly as we came with a little baby the room was big and comfortable with a very nice bathroom the location is perfect and we almost did not have to use public transportation and there is also a direct bus from the airport to the opera i will definitely recommend it to my friends on their visit to paris
