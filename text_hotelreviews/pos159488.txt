everything about the hotel was fantastic it is in a great busy location yet was not too loud at night times the staff were friendly and very helpful we had a superior room and our friend had the standard room both were adequate but the superior room was much larger and had a bath and separate toilet if you can afford to i would pay the extra when i next visit paris i will be staying at hotel saint petersbourg opera
