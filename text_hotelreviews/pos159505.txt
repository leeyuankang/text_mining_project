excellent location central to visit all major tourist attractions on foot department stores just around the corner bus stops and metro stations in the next street if you didn t want to walk room was fabulous and big junior suite on the floor with juliet balconies very grand and tastefully decorated everything about the hotel smelt fresh and had been decorated i wasn t sure if there was a hotel bar or not but we didn t need one we had stayed at the radisson blu airport hotel the night before and st peters was much better we would definitely return
