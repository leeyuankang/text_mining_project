the staff is very friendly helpful and english speaking the hotel is elegantly decorated very cosy and rooms are spacious and equipped with a mini bar too prices for the mini bar were reasonable our double bed was huge breakfast was delicious and there was something to suit everyone s taste buds scrambled eggs and sausages baguettes hams and cheeses cereals yogurts juices and obviously croissants on our last night we booked a taxi and prices were fixed and not over priced the receptionist even offered to give us a wake up call since we were leaving early i would highly recommend this hotel if you re staying in paris
