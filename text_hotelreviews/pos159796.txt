the room was absolutely beautiful i wished with all my heart i could have stayed a little longer service was a little slow but i think it was because americans are accustomed to rushing once i relaxed and let go and took the time to look at all the pretty little details and listen to the music and just be in the moment the service and the friendliness was perfect
