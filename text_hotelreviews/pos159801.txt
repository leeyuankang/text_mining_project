this is a beautiful hotel close to champs elysees ihave stayed here many times since it is very expensive and i now do not order room service or breakfast the desk is very helpful but the hotel has in my opinion become tired and not quite what it was i had the feeling that it was cutting costs perhaps due to the economic downturn like most of the hotels i revisited on my recent visit where were the godiver chocolates it has very high ceilings with beautiful silk curtains and a french bathroom a truly french experience and worth it if you can find a good deal all very lovely but a very expensive hotel i keep returning for past memories
