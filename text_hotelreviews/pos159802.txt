me and my wife both newlyweds stayed here for nights for a quick break after the wedding the bed was fantastic very large and comfortable for a great nights sleep the staff were very accommodating to even the smallest of requests the hotel was clean and very romantic from the old lift to the fancy lamps to the classy seats i m definitely staying here again to make use of the spa facilities which are complementary if you stay at the hotel
