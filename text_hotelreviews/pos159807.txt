beautiful hotel loved how it felt very unique and parisienne instead of just being in a chain hotel which could be anywhere great room with a huge spa bath could even see eiffel tower from the bedroom window great free wifi throughout the hotel spa was fab fresh flowers throughout the hotel which smelled amazing fantastic traditional lift hotel staff very accommodating and friendly they even keep plug adapters behind reception if you forget yours
