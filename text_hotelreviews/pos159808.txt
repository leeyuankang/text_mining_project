hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel decor and furnishings were tasteful and wholly in keeping with the period style of the building apart from the awful modern art painting above the bed the old person lift was quirky and fun room service and food were very good location just off the champs elysee was convenient and relatively quiet given the french affinity to the car horn metro stations were within very easy walking distance overall we had a great stay and would definitely stay at this hotel again
