location right next to avenue montaigne nice breakfast we had a prime roomon the floor with amenities and bathrobes and slippers so i guess everything was fine our friend on the floor however had a regular single and did not get even the simplest amenities not speaking about a bathrobe but what you gonna do the location sells itseft
