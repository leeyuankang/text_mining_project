the beds were extremely comfortable which is very important to me loved the chairs with small table to sit while reading or watching the tv and the in room kettle was great while there is satellite tv the majority of the channels were news programs and all channels were in french since i speak fr that was not a problem but if you don t you won t get much use out of the tv the location was quiet in a more residential section of the city however if you want to be closer to a lot of activity when you step out your door choose a different location of timhotel metro stops within walking distance about minutes away and the front door was always locked the front desk opened it when you buzzed in a nice touch for security the staff especially farrann were always helpful
