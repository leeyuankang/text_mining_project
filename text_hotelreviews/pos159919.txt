i regularly stay in the hotel the staff is very friendly professional and accommodating the rooms are all very complete refreshments toileteries a super comfortable bed and clean design bathrooms size of room depends on booked room type but even the smallest is okay for paris the area is lovely very central but in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of nice typical restaurants
