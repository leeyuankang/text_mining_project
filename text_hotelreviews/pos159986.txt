the bed was super comfy and the pillows were dreamy we had clean bed linen both nights along with very soft fluffy towels and bath robes the staff are very attentive and the ambience of the hotel is traditional deferential and very comfortable i had a delicious hot chocolate as a nightcap and if money were no object would stay here every time we visit london
