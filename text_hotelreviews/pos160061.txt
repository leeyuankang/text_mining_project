the breakfast was great and the room was clean the staff was very nice our stay didn t start out very well our room wasn t ready when we arrived at pm because the were overbooked we were told we had to wait in the restaurant until pm they didn t offer us any compensation while we waited we were getting really nervous because we had tickets to concert and had planned to leave from the hotel at pm when we saw the room we were also a little disapointed we have stayed many times at radisson and always liked it but this room was very small and tight the bed was not even queen size and that bothered us a little bit during the whole weekend but everything else was good the location is perfect the staff was willing to help with everything and the breakfast was good
