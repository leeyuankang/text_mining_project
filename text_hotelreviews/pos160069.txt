i was very impressed by the management s approach to address an issue we were facing the room was very noisy very close to oxford street and tiny i have travelled with my pregnant daughter and we were about to book an alternate hotel however the shift manager during evening alex if i am not mistaken has offered us an alternate room in another part of the hotel and made any effort to ensure it was convenient for our needs eventually we have decided to stay in this hotel until the end of our vacation i was also very impressed by the staff s friendly approach and by the breakfast menu
