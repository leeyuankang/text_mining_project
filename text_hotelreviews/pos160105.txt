out of for location rooms are tiny but nice bathroom could have been cleaner staff were very nice there was a building site right outside our window which started at on the saturday morning i tried to ring reception to complain but the phone was broken and we were awake anyway at that stage i complained when we left and they gave us a complimentary lunch which was fab overall a nice hotel but you are really paying for location if i was to go again i would stay in a nicer hotel further out near to an underground train
