the location of this hotel is fantastic right on oxford street next to debenhams we were away for my birthday and on arrival we had a gorgeous chocolate cake and a bottle of chardonay along with a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries and a balloon as we arrived late it was a lovely surprise the room had everything that we needed and was very clean all the staff we had contact with were very helpful and polite the breakfast was lovely and the staff there were also very helpful and accommodating
