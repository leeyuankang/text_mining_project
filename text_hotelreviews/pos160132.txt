i cannot praise the staff more on several occasions over a night stay we had staff go out of their way to help us including finding us a last minute afternoon tea reservation and arranging for a surprise free dessert at the restaurant to allowing me into the breakfast room minutes early on the saturday for some muesli and coffee to allow me to eat before an early group bike ride the staff were excellent breakfast was standard fare and was hot and fresh eggs made to order was a nice option other than just offering scrambled eggs like some places location was excellent directly across from the bond street underground and with excellent bus service right out front all the tourist hotspots soho piccadilly hyde park etc reachable within minutes
