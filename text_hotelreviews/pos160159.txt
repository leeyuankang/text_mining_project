after i conveyed my initial disappointment that we were not given a twin room though we had indicated this in our booking n request this was promptly rectified by the manager juan he quickly searched for a twin room and when none was available offered to upgrade us to a deluxe twin room throughout our stay another room that had a strong smell of smoke tho a none smoking room was quickly switched to another area that was quieter had a better room configuration n without the smell of smoke i was very impressed by his service and proactive approach to ensuring guest satisfaction great job juan
