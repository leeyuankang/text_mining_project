the location was the best in my opinion because it was right on oxford street the main attraction for tourists and in reachable distance t there places like the oxford circus the experience of staying in radison was greatly enhanced by the staff especially the concierge that would always be friendly and kind and help with the tickets booking which made the stay much more enjoyable
