second time i have used for business my room was really clean and well presented i was on the quiet side of the hotel so really lovely facilities good nice pool not huge but there was no one else in when i went for early morning laps also sauna and stream breakfast offers really good selection they were busy good service when i first sat down i asked for fried eggs which are cooked to order which were a bit slow coming out overall really good quality hotel close to central london and chelsea really nice to have battersea park just across the road great park really nice feature lots to see
