the bedroom is a nice size and i appreciate having a bath and shower the bathrobes big fluffy white towels fresh white linen and comfy beds were superb and the location is very convenient room service was also extremely efficient the huge television and big choice of channels including the pay tv channel were also great the aircon was perfect the plate glass windows ensured that the room was quiet and the wifi is super fast in addition there were always cabs outside if needed in summary everything worked and the room was extremely comfortable what more could you ask for and i think it s great value for money
