lovely modern room which had a lovely big sofa for us both to sit on and watch tv much better than having to sit on the bed rooms were also much more generous in size than other hotels we have stayed in in london great having battersea park chelsea shops so close staff very friendly and helpful large desk which we noted would be good if staying on business would have used spa if we had been staying for longer
