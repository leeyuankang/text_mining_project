very friendly pleasant and responsive staff the spa area was small but well kept and we really enjoyed the sauna the robes were very comfortable and a nice extra it was a little inconvenient in terms of location since most of the sightseeing we did was along the thames but it was a beautiful location nonetheless and in very close proximity to the lovely chelsea bridge really good experience overall
