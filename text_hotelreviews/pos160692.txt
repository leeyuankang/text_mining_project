the room was very comfortable good shower with nice large bath towels tea making facilities are always welcome we checked in early and our room was not ready so left our bags with reception when we returned in the evening they had put our bags in our room which was a nice extra effort touch service at the bar was good and the drinks were served properly with ice that was not melting and slices of lime etc
