reception staff couldn t have accommodated us anymore when we returned to the hotel to collect our bags after checking out i asked would it be possible to use the shower facilities at the spa to freshen up as we were meeting up with friends before travelling home when we discovered the shower was an open shower beside the pool the management at reception were more than happy to give us an access key so we could use the private shower in the gym also arrived at the hotel to beautiful scattering of rose petals on the bed in the shape of a to celebrate my boyfriends birthday the hotel went above what they were required to do to accommodate us at such a great price
