the room was brilliant and quite luxurious comfortable clean and with very good facilities the bathroom in particular was very nice and the bed was huge the food at the bar also came as a nice surprise i normally make a habit of avoiding hotel meals i usually find them overpriced and unimaginative but the pestana burger was excellent big tasty and very good value for money
