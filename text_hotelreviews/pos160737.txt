we enjoyed our stay very nicely decorated and clean the only criticism is location to the tube is quite far next time i will book a hotel close to the tube second thing i specifically booked this hotel because i wanted a swimming pool for my year old boy the hours for children were so limited we were only able to use the pool once for mins
