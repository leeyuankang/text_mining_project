breakfast was delicious plenty of hot and cold options including amazing pastries loved the mini pain au chocolates which were always fresh baked the room was spacious with comfy bed and great bathroom didn t get to try the spa unfortunately but heard others saying it was lovely right by chelsea bridge so we took a lovely minute walk to knightsbridge in the sun
