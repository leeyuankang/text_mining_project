our room was lovely and spacious with great decor and it had everything we needed safe fridge tea coffee making facilities and plenty of hanging space even though it faced the railway line it was very quiet right from the start the staff were very friendly and very efficient and helpful although the hotel is not right in the city it has easily accessible links to transport to get you where you want to go our stay was definitely great value for a london hotel and we wouldn t hesitate to stay there again
