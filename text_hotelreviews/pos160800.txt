room was very nice spacious with a nice bathroom shower and bath the staff were lovely on arrival and good on check out kept our bags to allow us to explore our last day in london was only there one night so didn t get the use of the spa facilities or restaurant the location was actually ok uber is cheap so the min drive to town was good and it was only a min walk which on a nice day would be lovely with the views
