we took the heathrow express to paddington and the hotel was a short walk away it was right beside hyde park and numerous tube stations we actually walked to oxford street without realising it hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff were very willing and helpful breakfast was a buffet or a full english for a few pounds extra if returning to london i would stay at this property again
