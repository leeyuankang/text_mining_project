we have stayed here several times and really love it it s a good boutique hotel in a great location very close to the west end we drive into town usually and its just outside of the congestion zone plus there is a car park around the corner at the thistle which is for hours we got our room at a great rate and were given an upgrade to a suite on arrival which was gorgeous very comfy spacious room and bed fabulous walk in rain shower the staff here are always very friendly and helpful continental breakfast is included and is a very good selection if you want something cooked it is at a reasonable price too not a hefty price tag the hotel is in a quiet location yet just off the bayswater road will always make this our first choice if we can
