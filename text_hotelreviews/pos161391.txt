great place and area if you want to be away from the city madness in a few steps you walk into hyde park not exactly a punishment though and you walk your way to oxford regent st and mayfair min nice spacious room however small but clean and newly decorated bathroom but not an issue at all breakfast buffet is nothing to complain on
