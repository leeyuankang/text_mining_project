comfortable bed good size bedroom and bathroom for london very clean quiet location helpful staff the heating didn t work on our floor but the staff offered to supply us with an electric heater or move us to another hotel at their expense including the taxi fare we felt the staff did the best under the circumstances they also gave us free cooked breakfast in the morning
