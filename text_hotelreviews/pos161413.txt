what an absolute gem of a boutique hotel lovely quiet location beautiful decor and ambience friendly helpful staff the family room was huge compared to other london hotels lovely little added extras from sweets on the landing to nice bathroom accessories we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will visit again without a shadow of a doubt
