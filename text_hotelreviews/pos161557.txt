spotlessly clean apparently refurbished a year ago and well decorated with excellent bathroom very obliging staff continental breakfast a cut above the average with really good quality ingredients proper coffee maker in the room a nice touch once you ve found out how to use it very quiet location reasonable restaurants within a short walk reasonable value at a large discount
