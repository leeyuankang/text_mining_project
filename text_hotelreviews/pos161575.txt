this is a great hotel quiet clean modern comfortable and very close to hyde park the staff was very kind and helpful luckily we had the chance to be upgraded to the executive room which was perfect for two large luminous and very very comfortable good to know for european travelers in each room there is one socket that is compatible with european plugs the hotel is less than min walk from the lancaster gate underground station and less than min walk from a bus stop i strongly recommend this hotel
