only a walk from lancaster gate this is without a doubt the nicest hotel i ve stayed at this year it s rare to find a hotel i would choose to spend my own money on but i d stay here again for personal use lovely boutique feel great rooms and super clean facilities they even lent me an umbrella so i could go back downtown in the rain breakfast was continental and very fresh staff very friendly hope to stay again
