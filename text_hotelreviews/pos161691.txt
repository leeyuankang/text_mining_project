hotel is obviously new well presented very clean decorated to a high standard location is convenient for central london min walk to lancaster tube wifi is ok for business travellers although this hotel isn t really geared up for business needs room was fairly small club double i think but adequate no view as in basement apart from brick wall with slugs on wasn t really value for money as gbp per night however london prices are always high smoking area is handy if you smoke but i think it is mostly there to stop you smoking outside of hotel as this is probably frowned upon
