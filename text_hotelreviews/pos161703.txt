great location for hyde park both train stations and bus stops very clean and comfortable and the room was cleaned and made up daily which was always lovely to come back to at the end of the day when booking i asked for a quiet room and that s exactly what we got i sometimes wondered if there was anyone else staying as it was so lovely and quiet breakfast was plentiful and delicious with an option for a cooked breakfast which we never had as the buffet style breakfast was more than enough would definitely choose arbor hyde park to stay in again and recommend to anyone planning a trip to london
