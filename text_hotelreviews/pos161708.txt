fantastic location about a minute walk from paddington station heathrow express minutes walk from kensington gardens hyde park the hotel was spotless the breakfast room staff were very friendly little snack treats were available for guests on levels which was a nice touch the bathroom was probably the best i ve encountered in any uk hotel in terms of being fresh modern with good water pressure a selection of shower head options all in all an enjoyable stay
