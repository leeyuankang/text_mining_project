arbor hyde park is a bit cheaper than some of the boutique hotels near hyde park but this is a basic hotel with no character or cheer more like an expensive pension it is not good value for money and does not deserve a high rating for comfort or service probably ok for a no frills business stopover in london definitely not recommended as a holiday stay in london
