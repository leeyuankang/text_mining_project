all staff here are customer focused at check in we were offered an upgrade to an executive room to make it more comfortable for the length of our stay which was for seven days that was most appreciated staff at breakfast were welcoming courteous and super efficient cooked breakfasts were available at an extra cost which we declined but there was a superb range of items to select from at the continental breakfast which was more than adequate the hotel is located in a quiet area just five minutes walk to lancaster gate underground and a couple of local pubs the swan on bayswater rd and the mitre on craven terrace recommended
