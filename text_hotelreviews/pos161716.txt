we stayed here for nights and we loved it compared to many hotels in london of the same category this was far better the rooms are a bit small but as the average in london but clean and with all the comforts including a nespresso machine biscuits tea a kettle and water all complimentary the breakfast is included and it is very good quality the staff is always very nice and trying to help the position is great as mins walk from lancastergate tube station right in front of hyde park we will definitely come back and recommend it to anyone
