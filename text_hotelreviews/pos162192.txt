very good location just a minute walk from liverpool street station but be careful as it is a but hidden behind some works i booked a double room which was comfortable and clean it had a fridge and a safe the bathroom was fine but no space to put your toiletries the room also lacked a place where you can open the suitcase service was good and wi fi fine good value for money for london standards
