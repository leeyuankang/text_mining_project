i picked this hotel due to its location and wasn t disappointed the rooms are small but considering we were in a basement room the secondary glazing ensured a great nights sleep even with a major construction site outside the ensuite had everything you needed including the best shower the staff were friendly and helpful and even though they don t offer a breakfast they provide snacks etc in the room
