great location and close to liverpool street station and where i needed to be was worried whether it would be noisy when i arrived as i was on the street front but hotel was quiet during the night and i got a good night s sleep bed was firm but comfortable lots of free snacks tea coffee and water provided as they don t provide breakfast
