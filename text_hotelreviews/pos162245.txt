not the best hotel i ve ever been but not even the worst my room was really small there was room enough for a double bed and a little isle but the bathroom was big and comfortable enough the modern style applied to the room makes the room really nice there was a big tv mounted to the wall in fron of the bed so if you like it you can enjoy your tv while comfortably laying down on your bed
