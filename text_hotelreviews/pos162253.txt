i stayed at this hotel in november it was a really nice experience first of all i arrived at the hotel at i asked about early checking in my comments while booking but there was no guarantee smiling lady from the reception kept me amused with conversation for the half hour while my room was preparing at i had a rest in my room and my early check in was absolutely for free i would like to say that all staff was nice and friendly my room was small but clean quite comfortable and there was a very good big enough and well equipped bathroom towels were extremely white and soft shower cabin had a tropical rain option and it was a pleasant addition to the standard facilities there was also mini bar with free of charge snacks and a bottle of water which were delivered every day another pleasant surprise was an international plug it was truly convenient to be independent of power adaptor and another one and very important advantage was location the hotel was perfect situated in london city and had the best value for money
