very cute small hotel ideally located the rooms are super small but this is london so i did not expect more but very new well equipped and well planned so you feel comfortable i anyway was just sleeping there as you are in london not to stay in a room location is perfect min walk to the liverpool street station great connections to everything by tube or bus couple of restaurants bars shops near so you are good even in the area hotel does not serve breakfast but gives cookies and nuts also coffee and tea in the room but you can have food everywhere in london so i really enjoyed my stay great value for money if i visit london again will stay there as well
