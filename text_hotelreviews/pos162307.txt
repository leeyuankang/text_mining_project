great location near to liverpool st station so we stayed one night after a late flight because it s the city terminus for the stanstead airport express train also they have hr front desk service convenient it was recently remodeled and was nice but really small room despite being next to a huge construction site the noise wasn t an issue and we were overlooking the construction pit
