the location it was just across the street from my office building the room was clean shower etc was new and with thermostat was a bit worried about the construction sound mentioned in other reviews but my room had an extra glass added in addition to the old style single glazed window so it was ok i had a double room and it was just about the right size for me alone i imagine that a single room could be rather tiny
