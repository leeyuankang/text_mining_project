the staff were very friendly and supportive especially victoria she was really helpful and supportive the location is close to most of the main touristic locations in central london in addition to the main underground stops there lack of breakfast option is not a big issue as the hotel is in close proximity to many reasonably priced restaurants and supermarkets
