very nice staff that make you feel welcome and give a life to the hotel the hotel has a theme to it you on board a train and travelling so it makes you enjoy it so much more it seemed very small from the outside but it just made everything so accessible and convenient especially as a business traveller room was impeccably clean and big the bathroom was spacious bright and very clean too
