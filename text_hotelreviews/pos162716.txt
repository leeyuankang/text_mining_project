the hotel has a very nice interior and is very clean the rooms are not big but comfortable bathroom is modern and big enough comfortable bed the location is good close to the gare du nord train station and it takes to go to the city center by train and about on foot to reach sacre coeur cathedral a lot of nice restaurants and cafes around price is fair
