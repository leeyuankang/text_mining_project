excellent hotel in central paris just opposite gdn perfect for eurostar and cdg connecting train exactly what i needed the most refreshing element was that the hotel had real character not just a set of boxes with a fancy lobby like most hotels around the world they had gone to town on giving the feel of the glory days of the orient express a really pleasurable place to stay the staff could not have been more helpful and seemed genuinely proud of their hotel it gave the place a really happy atmosphere in paris i know it was great value for money i would highly recommend this to anyone needing a convenient base in paris
