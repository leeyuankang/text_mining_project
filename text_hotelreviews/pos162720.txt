to be honest i was a bit afraid of choosing a hotel so close to the train station because i thought there might be the risk of paying too much money for a finally low level what i experienced in reality minutes to walk from gare du nord completely renovated new hotel all employees were really and honestly friendly and attentive and they obviously identified themselves with their job the concierge carried my daughthers suitcase upstairs and explained the theme idea of the hotel with abandon the breakfast was really good incl fresh scrambled eggs due to the excellent location close to the metro hub gare du nord all destinations for excursions were easy to reach would go there again immediately
