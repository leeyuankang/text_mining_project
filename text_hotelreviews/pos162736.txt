very cozy and clean hotel though the rooms are small but as i understood all the rooms in paris are small and there is no really a need for in a bigger space me and my friend shared a room of two and it was quite enough the location is great quiet and close to transportation shopping centers and there are really good restaurants in a walk distance of several minutes only the staff is more than kind always happy to help very recommended
