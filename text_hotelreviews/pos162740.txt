fantastic location perfect if you are in town for anything at the parc d expositions an easy walk to the ch telet les halles station with a direct train to the grounds staff was friendly and helpful great area if travelling alone or too tired to venture far after a day out tons of restaurants to choose from i like staying in this arr and this was the best location i ve stayed at
