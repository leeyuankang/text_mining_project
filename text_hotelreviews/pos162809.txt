really nice and helpful staff everything was neat and clean the room itself was very nice with an extra door that you could close to shut the noise out from the corridor toilet if your partner had to go at night there was also this iron curtain outside your windows that you could close security felt safe though there are also some slippers and two robes if you are planning on going to the spa or sauna never got the chance to tryout the spa facility but it looked really nice and inviting and they got a computer that you can borrow free of charge mac wich for me was abit tricky lots of lighting comfy bed with four pillows and one cover big enough for two you get an umbrella to borrow if need be wich i needed at the time and if you got an early flight it is super easy and close to porte maillot takes perhaps min normal walking pace the breakfast was nice but nothing over the top will get you going though the hotel is located on a sidestreet away from the worst noise and you got restaurants just around the corner the whole experience from when you walked inside until you left was very pleasant and i would not hesitate to go there again
