the room was tiny and not clean it was more like a stars hotel with a pool i did not use the pool they take a copy of credit card which is pretty stupid in the sense of security and not secure for the guest they give a login and password for the wifi but wifi does not require any password when i called them about it they suggest me to reset my computer they do not have a twin bed in the room but they brought two person beds together and this was extremely uncomfortable
