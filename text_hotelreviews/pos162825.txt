the staff were fantastic always happy to help the location was very central close to the arc de triomphe and in a nice area the hotel was very clean and the bed really comfortable enjoyed the breakfast it had a good selection of food both hot and cold and although the classic double room was quite small my friend and i each had one it had everything needed and was perfect for one person i would happily return to this hotel very reasonably priced
