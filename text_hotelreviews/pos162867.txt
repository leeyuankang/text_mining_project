the service was really excellent the staff was incredibly helpful and comforting considering that i was traveling alone and it was my first time in paris i really loved the decor of the hotel and the location room has a really amazing balcony that allows you to watch the beauty of paris at all hours of the day you can even see the tip of the eiffel tower
