really impressed with cleanliness the location is ideal as close to a major linking metro station if you don t mind a short walk up a slight hill the staff were very polite and helpful didn t have time for full use of facilities so unsure on their condition bedroom was more than amenable plenty of room and huge bathroom shower breakfast was help yourself continental buffet which was very pleasant free wifi was a nice bonus lift is useful especially if you have luggage
