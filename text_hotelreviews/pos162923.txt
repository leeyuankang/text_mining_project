booked nights stay for my son and his girlfriend staff were very accommodating and looked after him through out his stay they even provided a free upgrade to a deluxe room as it was his birthday i would highly recommend thud hotel as the rooms are slightly larger than the average for paris the addition of a pool and is very welcoming after a long day exploring the city the quality of the breakfast is first class and staff very attentive would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a visit to paris
