i felt welcome from the very first moment because of the very friendly and kind staff they really made me feel at home the room was perfect and cosy the bathroom was very clean and so was the rest of the room the hotel s location is very convenient as it is just like minutes away from porte maillot subway and rer station therefore one can move around paris without having to change lines many times there are several restaurants and cafes in the area which is perfectly safe and l arc de triomphe is within walking distance i would definitely stay again
