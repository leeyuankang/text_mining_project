the location was the best feature of this hotel it s close to everything you need and is safe and full of lights when u come back to the hotel late in the night you can walk in it s nice streets to get to sightseeing places great great place the room was extra clean and pleasent loved the free coffee in the lobby loved the happy time of serving cheese and wine the staff were very friendly
