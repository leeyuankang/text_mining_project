beds pillows and linens were incredibly comfortable room was small but charming french doors onto balcony were a definite plus could bring in lots of fresh air and light the breakfast was superb everything one could want the location can t be beat quiet with a neighborhood feeling and great bistro s on every corner but only blocks away from the arc de triomphe wonderful i would come back again and again
