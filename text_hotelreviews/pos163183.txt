we loved the design and the concept we had a three persons room and it was spacious with large bathroom which was a nice change after tiny traditional rooms and bathrooms in other hotels the hour free spa was a fantastic opportunity to relax after a long trip the concept of refreshments and the serve yourself bar is a very convenient and clever arrangement gives even more comfort during the stay we loved the hotel and will come back
