i had made the reservation following the evaluation on booking and tripadvisor this hotel merits its great note not only is it wonderfully well designed everything looks beautiful but the bed is comfortable the room is quiet the service is outstanding and i had a great alone time in the delightful pool spa area my room was ready for me when i arrived at the following day i asked for early cleaning of the room and it was done when i came back at finally i was sick the last day and they even let me do a late check out at and even asked if i needed extra honey tea etc i will definitely come back
