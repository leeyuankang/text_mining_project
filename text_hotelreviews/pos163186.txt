it s a nice spotless hotel in a quiet back street spacious room free afternoon coffees and teas very close to a metro station walking distance to the opera garnier and shopping centres la fayette and les printemps staff members very friendly and helpful i loved the exclusive spa experience the hotel can organise a taxi to pick you up from the airport charles de gaulle for the cheapest option is to take the rer b which stops at all terminals for about euros
