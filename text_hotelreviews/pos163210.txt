location is very good central but still quite secluded and not right in the middle of the tourist area very close to transports and to the opera the staff were very kind on arrival i was given a proper introduction to the hotel facilities and i was allowed to check in a bit earlier than the time rooms are well decorated and their size is pretty good from other reviews i ve read paris tends to offer little space particularly when it comes to bathrooms but the size of my room was big enough the hotel has a spa swimming pool that was included in the price of my booking sadly i didn t have the chance to try it
