the staff was super friendly and helpful and generally very pleasant to deal with there was a small kitchenette complete with cookin utensils for basic cooking so we were able to save some money by having breakfast in our room before we started the day location was excellent only a minute walk from the tube and there was a supermarket just outside the station for the previously mentioned breakfast we really enjoyed our stay
