the metro tube station is quite close the neighborhood is green and comfortable with lots of different stores and the park the hotel is quite good we liked it the staff is always there to help the room had the kitchenette and some utensils we needed for cooking the room temperature is easy to regulate whether you like it hotter or colder ask the staff it s not a problem another good point is that we had the better room type than what we paid for without extra charge we had our own bathroom though the hotel also offers rooms with shared bathroom so pay attention while choosing the room type
