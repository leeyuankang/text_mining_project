i payed for late check out at in the morning i was woken up by men knocking on the door to check the boiler i refused them to come in as there was girls and we did not feel commutable then we were woken again by builders on our roof and in our yard looking through our window smoking at our door and dropping things off the roof i had to leave early as it was scary uncomfortable i asked them to move also reported at reception and still waiting on a call back now nearly a week later before leaving on two more occasions they knocked on the door to come in the bedroom and check the boiler disappointed after a lovely stay i have videos of this in the morning but it will not allow me to upload but i would like everyone to see what we woke up to
