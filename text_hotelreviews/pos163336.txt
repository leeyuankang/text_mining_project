without a doubt one of the favorite hotels i stayed during my time in london upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff the staff were extremely friendly and helpful the hotel has a warm personality feel to it great quirky decorations throughout the bed was so comfortable you just do not want to get out of it very clean throughout will defiantly stay here again the kids also loved the free sweets
