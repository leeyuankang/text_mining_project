i liked everything i have worked in customer service hospitality for the past years and i can tell you the service was fantastic all staff was absolutely welcoming and genuine helpful when needed the hotel size is just perfect and doesn t make you feel like it s a standard chain of hotels but more a personalized service the decoration and attention to details in every part of the hotel is just fantastic there is always a tiny piece of art that is catching your eye the little courtyard is very cute and even though our room had the garden view we thought we d miss the street view it was just so relaxing with the sound of the water in the courtyard we loved the swimming pool fabulous and we had breakfast included which was an absolute great choice especially since there are some patisseries made by the famous pierre herme the location of the the hotel is just great and coming from the uae where as a woman i am used to safety and not being bothered when alone the streets around are safe and clean you can go shopping with no issue just always keep an eye on your handbag like in every big european city
