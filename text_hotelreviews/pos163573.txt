the staff was extremely helpful and responsive to our needs and requests on our first night at the hotel we found a stain on the bed sheet we immediately reported this to the front desk manager who did everything in his capacity he changed out the sheet himself to make sure we did not have to sleep on a dirty bed sheet that night the next day we were moved to a different room that not only had clean bedding but also more square footage
