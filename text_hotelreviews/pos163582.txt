the location was excellent three blocks from victoria station the bed was comfortable and the amenities in the room were above average the room was small but perfect for just myself loved the fact that there was a mobile in the room that one can use with data to help with navigating around the city plus the ipad concierge located bedside for any requests to the front desk
