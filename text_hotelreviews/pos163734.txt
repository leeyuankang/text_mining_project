excellent location if you want to be a street away from marylebone high street and just a few minutes away from baker street oxford str etc small room in line with central london accommodation but still comfortable smart and compact layout having said that it did say it in the description i e minimalistic design but for a short stay i did not mind since the room was overall very clean the room did not have a view but it was very quiet very friendly stuff
