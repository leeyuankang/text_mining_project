the location is great and easy to reach by underground stop baker street the neighborhood is lovely the hotel is surrounded by beautiful houses and a lot of nice places to eat from breakfast to dinner oxford street is a minute walk along pretty shops bookstores and restaurants the staff is super friendly and very helpful maybe because it isn t a very big hotel it all feels very amicable our room was across the street from the reception so it felt as if we had our own apartment in the city the room was small but big enough for the time we spent inside it all felt very new no dusty old stuff but pretty glass doors a comfy bed a huge separate shower and blinds that let you sleep like a baby
