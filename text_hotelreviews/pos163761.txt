this hotel is located a minute walk from the baker street tube station and in a little cluster of hotels on the same block as the princess grace hospital for the money it is big it appears to be meant for a small family that might want to stay longer term because there was a microwave refrigerator dishes and utensils i stayed in a duplex so there was separation between a sitting area with a tv and the sleeping area upstairs which had another tv
