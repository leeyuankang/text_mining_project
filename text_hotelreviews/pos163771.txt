staff were friendly and very accommodating of our request to move to a room with better wifi reception we were working remotely while in london even upgraded us for free to a larger room which was amazingly sunny spacious and tastefully decorated it really made our stay special also we really enjoyed breakfast in the room the portions are healthy and plentiful would definitely stay here again
