overall i loved the studio we stayed in the rooms are fairly small especially the kitchen area but it s perfectly adequate and i don t look to cook anyway it s perfect if you want to make hot drinks and heat something in the microwave or even get a takeaway as there are plates etc location is amazing just minutes walk from marylebone high street which is a stunning place to stay staff were accomodating they are refurbing the main house so we stayed in the property opposite so it wasn t any problem
