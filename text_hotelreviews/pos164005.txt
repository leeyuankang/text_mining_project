the hotel is in a great location very close to the champs elys es and public transport and the staff will call a taxi if needed but there is also a taxi stand about a minute walk away the room was large enough for three and in paris that is sometimes hard to find the staff was also very pleasant and helpful and the welcome and complimentary grapes and chocolates etc were a welcome addition
