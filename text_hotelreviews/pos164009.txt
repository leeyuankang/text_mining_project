front desk staff were most accommodating and helpful the hotel is very quiet with beautifully furnished rooms we did not try the restaurant but they do offer breakfast if you d like that the elevator is small but saves you the trek up the winding staircase with bags location is one long block off the champs elysees and the fdr metro entrance so it s near tons of restaurants and shopping venues bring lots of money
