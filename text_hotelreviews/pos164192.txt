the best feature of this hotel is its location we were only back in london for one night having stayed earlier in the month in an apartment given the cost of other similarly located hotels in london the price is ok but it is exorbitant compared to apartments it is very easy to access covent garden tube and catch the picadilly line straight out to heathrow so it is worth staying here for the convenience of access rooms are clean breakfast is what you expect in a large hotel buffet style and good to be included in the price
