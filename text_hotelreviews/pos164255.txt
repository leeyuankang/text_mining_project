i stayed at strand palace hotel for a few days in june certainly not worth it although it is very well located the rooms are extremely small carpets all over the hotel and no air conditioning in the rooms which made our stay very unpleasant considering we had some days with temperature over breakfast was very good although payed separately pounds per person day elevators very slow took the stairs most of the times even though i was staying in the floor very expensive for what it offers
