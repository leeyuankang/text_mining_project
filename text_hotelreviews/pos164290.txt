the location was great so close to the sights and a short walk from covent garden staff were pleasant and we were able to check in earlier and leave our bags the room was smaller than expected the bed pushed up against the wall so no chance of falling out a nice stay and all in all a clean and tidy room with complimentary tea biccies and water
