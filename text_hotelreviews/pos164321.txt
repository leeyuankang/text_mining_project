room was nice it was a good size especially for a big city hotel bed was very comfortable no ac so it was a little hot but there was a fan the hotel is very centrally located so we walked to everything there are lots of nice restaurants and pubs right around the corner plus it is in the theater district so if you had tickets to a show you could walk to it
