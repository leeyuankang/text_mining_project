i loved everything about the strand palace maybe that s because i ve never really stayed at a higher class hotel before but from the moment the attendant opened the door and carried our luggage the couple of steps upwards to the lobby i fell in love with the place the lobby is spacious and even with bigger groups of tourists it didn t ever really feel crowded check in went smoothly and the signs on the walls will help you find your room quickly we had to wait a short time for breakfast on the first morning outside of the restaurant seating area but i like that better than standing around with a loaded tray hunting for a table and the buffet was really offering pretty much all you could ask for all in all i can really only recomment the strand palace hotel expecially if you re sight seeing and want a lot of the major attractions of london within a bare hour walking distance btw we had room service on our first night because we were winded from the travel and the food was just awesome
