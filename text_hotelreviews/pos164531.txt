we stayed in one of the executive rooms which were of a good size and well appointed however our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the strand and owing to the large amount of emergency vehicles sounding their sirens throughout the night our sleep was very disturbed owing to this disturbance although the bed was huge and very comfortable we did not feel very refreshed when awaking i think this should be pointed out when booking and patrons should be given the opportunity to choose the location of the room front or rear
