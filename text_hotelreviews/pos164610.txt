excellent location comfortable stay i stayed in a standard twin comfortable clean and functional but didn t feel special there was no bath the lights were very dim which made the room look a bit gloomy and there was no complimentary hot chocolate perfectly adequate for staying for business reasons but i wouldn t have booked this place for a romantic trip away the best thing about this hotel is the gentleman who helped us with our baggage in the lobby he was very friendly helpful and approachable
