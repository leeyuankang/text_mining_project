breakfast at a head offer excellent value very central and easy to access from waterloo not as luxurious as the address suggests but great for the savoy theatre and not as expensive as the hotel thank goodness hotel didn t have air conditioning as i find it difficult to sleep with it on a little more milk and coffee would be appreciated
