very cute cosy room if a little warm but the radiators were adjustable good shower and extremely quiet i d requested a quiet room on a higher floor we got number the location was fantastic right in between covent garden and the thames and the hotel manager was kind enough to welcome us with a bottle of prosecco and a hand written card for my partner s birthday we got a good rate and pre paid through this site we were ultimately pretty happy with the experience
