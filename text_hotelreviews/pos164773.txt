i was delighted with my stay at strand palace and hope to return as a solo female traveller i was concerned with safety i found the location of the hotel to be very conducive to popping out and about both in daytime and night i was able to go to theaters at night stroll back the room had been described as cosy when i booked so i was expecting very small but it was a perfect size really quite spacious for the bathroom was a pleasant surprise too the staff were very helpful i also liked the fact that i was in a room on the first floor i felt that was sensitive to my single female traveller status and helped to make me feel safe this was an important trip to me my first alone in an hotel in a major city i hope to come back
