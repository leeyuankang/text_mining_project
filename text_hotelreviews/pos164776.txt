the cosy double was perfectly adequate in size for my requirements i had a lovely view of the strand a comfortable bed and beautifully clean bathroom the staff were friendly and helpful i will certainly come to the strand palace again and not only because of its excellent location so near to theatres and so many of the main tourist attractions
