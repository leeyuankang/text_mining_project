the staff where very friendly and professionally helpful they had local knowledge which helped me to make the most of my stay even when i signed out the lady offered to get me a taxi and helped with directions to the nearest station when i said that i planned to walk i was very pleased with my complimentary upgrade i specifically stayed near an event on aldwich so the hotel position is superb
