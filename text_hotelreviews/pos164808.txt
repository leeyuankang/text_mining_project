check in and check out very good quick and easy room was ready when we got there at very clean bathroom could probably do with updating but shower was lovely and powerful bed wasn t that comfortable as i prefer a softer mattress having said that i slept very well saw better looking hotels for the money i paid but the location cannot be beaten especially if you are going to the theatre worth every penny just for that
