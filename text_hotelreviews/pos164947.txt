the staff were extremely polite friendly and helpful the room was spotless and the huge bed was very comfortable there was a great variety of food for breakfast and it was all well cooked and attractively presented we can also recommend the carvery both for quality of food and value for money we particularly appreciated the way we could leave our luggage with the concierge after we had checked out so that we didn t have to lug it around london for the rest of the day
