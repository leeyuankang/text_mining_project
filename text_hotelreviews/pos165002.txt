it was amazing the staff were great the facilities were very good it was quiet not to hot and not to cold very good shower will definitely go back there on our next visit to london everything was within walking distance and if you didn t want to walk buses and trains were very easy to get to i haven t got any bad comments or regrets the whole visit was brilliant
