the hotel is lovely staff very friendly although wasn t sure to tip the porter and think annoyed him but he was helpful and pleasant it s good location for the west end if going to shows and covent garden is a short walk away it s quite expensive as in london and thought room was bit small for the price but clean and tidy the man who you give bags too was brilliant and very helpful couldn t fault the place great place to go also good was nice for breakfast
