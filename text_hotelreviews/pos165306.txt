i loved the bed overall the hotel is very comfortable and the staff pleasant and helpful i was particularly impressed when i had inadvertently left my door ajar in mid afternoon when a member of security staff knocked on the door to check that all was well i am also a big fan of the excellent fish buffet at lunchtimes something which together with the location of the hotel will tend to draw me back in future and it s a terrific breakfast
