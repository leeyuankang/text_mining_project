it was christmas time and the hotel decorations were luffly and warming the staff were very friendly helpful and attentive the room was very clean and perfect for a short stay in london but best of all was the location ideal for covent garden and the west end which was where we were going i highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when visiting this part of london
