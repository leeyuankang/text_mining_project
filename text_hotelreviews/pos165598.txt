a well placed lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff we stayed in an executive king room which was surprisingly spacious considering other reviews with a wonderful comfortable bed the room had a very quiet and efficient air conditioning unit and so for the first time ever on the first night of an hotel stay we slept like a log little extras like slippers robes etc made it extra special breakfast was great too with a good choice on offer we got this room at half price which was excellent value we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definately stay again
