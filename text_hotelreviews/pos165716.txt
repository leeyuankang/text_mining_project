the hotel is in a fantastic location the check in staff were friendly it s very helpful that early check in was available for an additional but still a pain to pay extra mainly because normal check in is late afternoon the room was fairly big for a central london location good place to stay if you just need a bed it s a big hotel so rooms are available with short notice
