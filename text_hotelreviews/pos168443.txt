good location near but not too near gare du nord very friendly and helpful staff nice building with some original touches rooms quiet comfortable slightly corporate feel could do with some personal touches but of course it s part of a large chain liked that there were options for full or express breakfast recommended for short stay and when travelling by eurostar
