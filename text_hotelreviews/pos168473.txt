the room was large by parisian standards we took a junior suite as it was comparable in price to a triple room we had three single and very comfortable beds as requested bathroom had separate shower and bath with all clarins products the hotel was quiet and the staff at reception very welcoming and helpful would definitely stay again as there are great little restaurants near by if you re looking to be in the thick of the paris tourist district perhaps not the best location but if like us you have been to paris several times and like to be in an area with a more local vibe then would highly recommend
