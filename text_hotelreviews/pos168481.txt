everything was perfect it s just a short distance from a number of metro lines so the location is ideal with easy access to saint germain des pres trocadero montmartre and other areas the staff were very friendly particularly the breakfast restaurant staff the room was great and the bed was incredibly comfortable the breakfast was excellent and wide ranging with outstanding pastries they even had little touches like mini chocolate eggs under the tea cups for easter all in all it was a brilliant stay
