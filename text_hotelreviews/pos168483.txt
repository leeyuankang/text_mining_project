on our arrival march late at night there was absolutely amazing receptionist who provided so much support and information that it looked like we are the most and only welcomed guests in the whole hotel during other days other staff members were professional and polite but never gave that feeling of you are the most important guest in the hotel that that tall black hair receptionist with the glasses gave to us very pity we do not know his name
