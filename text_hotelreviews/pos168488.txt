excellent hotel will definitely come back staff were really great so helpful and courteous room was very comfortable location was convenient and not at all far from several metro stations lines the breakfasts were absolutely superb especially considering this is france where past experience has taught me to expect very little in the way of a good hotel breakfast all in all a great hotel can t recommend enough
