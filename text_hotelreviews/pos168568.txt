what a wonderful staff a big thank you to loredana lina and another lovely lady at the reception i do not know the name of sorry the view is spectacular the terace could be taken a bit more care of a really ugly flower box with dead flowers and a pile of hose pipes in the corner but all compensate for a superb location and the best staff
