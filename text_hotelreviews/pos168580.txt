breakfast was very good except for the scrambled eggs good variety of choices to select from fruit jam croissants cereal juice coffee ham cheese breads etc were fresh and excellent quality the egg bread and different jams were delicious water pressure in the rooms were very good for taking a bath or flushing the toilet should upgrade the toilets to use less water room size and bathroom size are a nice good size with plenty of room to move around especially compared to all the other surrounding hotels we had large closets with two full length sliding mirrors and large built in shelves large writing desk with chair and a chair with round table in a sitting area in front of the window large dresser by door was convenient to set things down when entering leaving the room large dining room with large attractive windows that open to let in a cool breeze on the main floor for eating breakfast last year our friend stayed in a hotel which had a very small room but everything was new and modern but his biggest complaint was everything was so small the room and bathroom was only large enough for person although it was considered a double room currently hotel castiglione is currently under renovations and will be completed in and then it will be a much more pleasant experience especially if they keep the large rooms which is an advantage over all the other local hotels in central paris having breakfast included with the superior room is a good price we wish the breakfast option was offered with the deluxe rooms too we decided we would rather have the breakfast option rather than the terrace balcony view large well lit bathroom mirror and double sink
