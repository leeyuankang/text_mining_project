i m a frequent traveler and i travel a lot around the world and its the worst experience that i faced on my life as when i arrived there they receptionist told me that we don t have room available and imagine that i have already paid and they have deducted the full amount from my card with no refunding me then they have transferred to other hotel and they were chasing me in removing such facilities as breakfast and other in order to have a quiet bigger room as we reached there at and we were exhausted so we don t have chance to look after other hotel i don t consider this hotel as star its not a t all believe me its only star hotel bad treatment bad lobby and a construction work was going on even i told them that i m going to write about your hotel in booking com although the location is good but the rooms and the facilities not at all the same as the posted pictures in the website
