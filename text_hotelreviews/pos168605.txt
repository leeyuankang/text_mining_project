the hotel is currently going through a major renovation refit which meant you felt like you were in a bit of a building site the two main lifts didnt work so the very small max person service lift was the only way of accessing the floors hence big queues but all this will no doubt be sorted and it will be very good when work completed excellent staff very helpful and friendly i had room on floor and was very clean and very comfortable excellent superb location
