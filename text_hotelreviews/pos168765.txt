liked the bar area in the evening i thought it would be packed but it was just right close to the olympia for lfcc tea and toast for breakfast was nice except they brought me my tea instead of me going to get as much as i want but i m sure they d give more if you ask really pleasant staff except the concierge who took our bags in miserable and didn t say anything to us could have at least let us know what on earth to do or a minimum a good morning madam sir i liked the seating area in reception it meant we were waiting for our train out of the rain in a comfortable chair
