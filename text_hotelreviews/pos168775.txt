the bed was very comfortable and i appreciated the very fluffy blanket the breakfast buffet was delicious and offered a good variety of meals the staff was very friendly and very helpful there aren t many restaurants around the hotel but the bus stops next to the hotel which will take you to restaurants in minutes depending where you want to go the buses are very reliable the hotel was in a quieter part of the city which made it very comfortable
