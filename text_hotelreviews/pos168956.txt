the hotel room was ready when we arrived at which was a bonus we didn t pay for breakfast there as there was plenty of alternatives on the high street and this made us get up and out to make the most of the day the bar area is very nice and it is handy that there is a costa coffee under the hotel staff very friendly and pleasant plenty of restaurants and bars a short walk away we went for the carnival so it was a good location for us
