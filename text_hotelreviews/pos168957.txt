we arrived earlier before the official check in time however the staff was able to help us to get a room so we can take a rest after a hour flight we contacted them via booking com earlier though the location is pretty great we have day oyster travel cards so we can either take a bus in which the stop is within a minute or arrive the nearby tube station high street kensington via the bus within walking distance of minutes there is a hour tesco in which you can buy groceries feeling pretty safe in the neighborhood the room was a bit old but no complaint as it is normal for hotels in big cities e g nyc the washroom is pretty new and in generally we had a great stay thanks for the comfy hotel and great location
