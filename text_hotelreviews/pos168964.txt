location was fine not too far to walk staff were friendly exterior looks posh bed very uncomfortable air conditioning was nice but loud no prices on mini bar or tray to give you a clue of what charges you d get so i didn t use it no free wifi which was kind of bad for being in a huge city large hotel yet they couldn t offer it the halls went on forever as the place was huge and there was a drunk women disturbing the peace and no staff around to report to the house keeping staff were amazing and lovely and would rate them every time they need a raise for being so kind and helpful
