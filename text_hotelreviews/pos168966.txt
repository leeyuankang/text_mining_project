the hotel was ideal for kensington area good to have coffee shop attached bar was comfortable with a wide choice of food and drink rooms could do with a freshen up disappointed with way some guests appeared to be treated waiting in a queue for check in and out many guests walked straight up to the desk and were catered for should have been advised to join the queue was very rude to then be interrupted whilst at the desk by a guest whose issue could and should have been resolved after i had been dealt with something that staff need to be instructed on
