i had a split booking of one night on thursday plus the weekend and thought this might present a problem checking in however penny on reception was brilliant at sorting the paperwork and programming the keycard so i wouldn t have to check out then in again room was away from the road so nice and quiet comfortable bed good supply of teas and coffees and shortbread biscuits decent sized tv in fact all you need after a hard day at olympia
