location great on top of olympia station and kensington and hyde park and clean functional rooms one room a bit dark as no ceiling lights just standing lights breakfast per person is too much we didnt bother and lots nice cafes nearby no view from windows as boxed in and window handle loose however for london we thought it offered reliable no fuss accomodation without any eccentricities and was modern and clean with a great reassurance of the hilton brand
