the staff were very helpful and as i had an unplanned visit from my overseas family members i was able to have them stay with me as i could have an extra bed added to the room this was so wonderful and really made my holiday great the hotel is in a good spot just minutes from kensington garden and buses plus circle and centre line train stations so access in and around london is easy i definitely recommend the cleveland
