less than minutes walk from paddington and yet peaceful location walkable to notting hill and kensington this is a grand old terraced building with comfortable though rather characterless rooms we got a free upgrade to an executive deluxe suite with a separate seating area which was great value for money the bed was very comfy the shower was hot but not that powerful no worse than most hotels though good towels and bedding staff were helpful and our room was made available for us early no breakfast but you could order a packed lunch type breakfast in your room we preferred to go out for breakfast but if you book direct on the hotel website there seem to be frequent free breakfast offers overall much better than i would have expected for london at this price we will definitely stay here if we visit this part of london again
