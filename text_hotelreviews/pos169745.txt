was in a good location close to queensway and bayswater tube stations the place was clean and the room we had was welcoming shower had great water pressure and mattress was comfortable we could also adjust the temperature of the room which was handy as we dont like the heater to be too warm even though it s winter nespresso coffee machine in the foyer went down a treat
