we enjoyed the visit friendly and cooperative staff the room was clean and spacious for a family room so did not feel cramped having a kitchenette was extremely handy as staying with a month old baby for days kitchenette was well designed compact and could be hidden away when not in use liked the dimmer lights over the bed as it helped with nighttime feeding the dressing table was a clever partition between the two double beds providing just enough privacy that we needed happy location wise nice area situated in central london and not too far away from local amenities and restaurants little add ons good pick of newspapers in the reception lounge enjoyed reading with a delicious cup of coffee from the nespresso machine will definitely consider returning
