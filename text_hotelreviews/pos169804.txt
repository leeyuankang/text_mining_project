staff was very very nice and helpful we reached the hotel pretty late in the evening and were too tired to head out too far thus we asked the staff at the reception for suggestions and they were very helpful and showed us the directions on a map to an area that was a minute walk from the hotel and had a lot of restaurants we could choose from the wifi was not working and we didn t get network on our cell phones because our room was in the basement so they helped connect to their other networks including the staff network to ensure that we weren t inconvenienced however those didn t work too well either because we were having issues with the wifi and no cell phone network the reception staff even agreed to move us to a room on a higher floor without any extra charges however they got a last minute booking and it wasn t possible the day we were checking out we had tried to book a cab the previous day but it got cancelled because there weren t any cabs available and our booking was cancelled however because we had no phone reception we didn t know it was cancelled and were waiting for minutes but as soon as we told the reception staff about this they arranged for a cab that got there within minutes room was nice and spacious and big enough for people double bed single bed with bags to stay in comfortably bathroom was nothing fancy but nice and clean kitchenette was very well equipped overall the hotel was good and the staff was amazing but we checked out days early because only a basement room was available where there was no network and the wifi didn t work properly so we couldn t plan our day look stuff up or book tickets online it would be a pretty nice place to stay at as long as you get a room that is not in the basement it was a minute walk from paddington station where the heathrow connect and heathrow express stop
