nothing really to find fault with overall a very well maintained property beautiful room although a bit small with a nice view of the square equally beautiful common areas cosy sitting room and breakfast room did not have dinner at the property but breakfast was marvellous as it was largely a served breakfast as opposed to only a buffet staff was extremely friendly and accommodating location is great as the immediate surroundings are away from the hectic traffic and still very close to the centre just a few minutes away from either baker street or marylebone tube stations
