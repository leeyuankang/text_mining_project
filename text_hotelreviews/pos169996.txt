very pleasant boutique hotel close to marylebone and baker street i chose a single room which was small normal in london but perfectly ok for a short stay for one person the bed was super comfy and i had a great nights sleep the room was nicely decorated with some nice touches not much of a view but never mind staff were very friendly and helpful there is a nice lounge and a bar and restaurant on site has the feel of a top class hotel but at an affordable for london price look forward to my next staff well done the owners and the staff
