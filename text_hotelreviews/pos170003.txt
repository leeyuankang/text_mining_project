the dorset square hotel is a delightful small hotel the staff make it they are so friendly the hotel itself is superbly located close to regent s park and the delightful marylebone high street and environs plus easy access to the rest of central london the rooms are beautiful and comfortable the bar and restaurant is a great place to eat and drink the cricket memorabilia and theme is quirky and fun and liked by non cricketing enthusiasts like the rest of my family and friends thomas lord s first cricket ground was the garden in the square
