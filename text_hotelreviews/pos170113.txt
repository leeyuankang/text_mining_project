my second stay here this time we were there for the tour de france final the location near champs elysees was excellent for that also good metro access to multiple lines the room itself was very big by paris standards and very well appointed nice breakfast great selection of restaurants close by and bars too recommend harry s bar for cocktails i came in on train to gare de lyon a very easy cab ride from there to hotel
