the stuff was extremely nice my wife sprained her ankle and it was hard for her to move at the beginning they helped us to find medicine bandage ice bags etc also allowed her to stay in the room several hours after the check out time it made it much easier to overcome a difficult situation the hotel is very nicely located and recently renovated very comfortable
