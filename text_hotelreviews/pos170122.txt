i loved everything about this beautiful hotel brilliantly located in the opera district and within walking distance of a major metro station it s very well situated from the lovely warm welcome including a free drink in the cosy bar to suggestions for restaurants and directions to attractions the staff were just excellent we were lucky enough to be offered a bigger room at a very reasonable increase in tariff which made our stay even better the decor and ambience is warm and stylish with a classic parisian feel our room was spacious and very well appointed and included large very comfortable twin beds on request plenty of storage space for cases clothes etc a small seating area and a balcony with views towards the magnificent garnier opera the spacious bathroom contained plenty of towels great shower and really nice toiletries the free wifi was efficient and the fridge well stocked the breakfast room was spacious and offered a good range to select from in short i couldn t recommend this wonderful hotel highly enough and am already planning to stay again in november
