this was just an excellent location min from the rossy bus and on the tour bus circuit it is a stones throw from the very lovely if high end shopping area of place de vendome but window shopping costs nothing so a great place to have a coffee or a glass of vino i had decided to go for a junior suite as was a treat and we then got upgraded which was just excellent to get such a spacious room in paris it allows you to really be at the centre and explore the receptionist i think marie was lovely and helpful we were lucky with the upgrade but the location is great and the bottle of champagne as part of the deal was great and a lovely welcome the breakfast was for coffee fresh orange juice and pastries
