we love the edouard paris opera we stayed at hotels in our month long stay in france and this hotel was by far the best it is a star hotel in our book and we can t recommend it strongly enough we stayed for nights and it was wonderful thanks edouard when we arrived the hotel staff brought us some fresh baked treats and a huge bottle of evian nice they gave us a welcome letter and checked on us in the first hour after we arrived to make sure everything was ok and to see if we needed anything every evening the cleaning staff checked in to see if we needed anything and if the room was cleaned to our satisfaction nice the staff were wonderful polite and extremely accommodating our bed was uncomfortable so they brought in an entire new bed for us wow now that s customer service any request was immediately responded to with a smile sometimes it seemed we just hung up and they were already at our door they gave us an upgraded room with a fantastic view it was beautiful the hotel was in a great location there was a wonderful daily breakfast that was included with our stay with a huge selection of delicious food we were very happy with our stay at the edouard and plan to stay there again it is a fabulous hotel with outstanding customer service stars and a
