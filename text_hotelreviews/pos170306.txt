the concierge navigator desk was extremely helpful we misplaced some items at the airport when we landed in paris they helped coordinated with the airline airport and helped retrieve the items promptly their recommendations of restaurants bars was nice and they organised immediate reservations at the venues we could also pickup tickets from them directly and avoid queueing up at some of the tourist spots the front desk was very pleasant and welcoming
