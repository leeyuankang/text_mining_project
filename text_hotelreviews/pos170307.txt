the check in was excellent i believe her name was frankie she was simply amazing as she greeted us with most welcoming remarks and even gave us the nougat for our kids who were not even with us she noticed that i was munching on them from the check in counter and commenting how good it was basically after that moment everything seemed good at the hotel generally the staffs were very well trained and little notes inside the elevator post it notes inside your rooms was simply great marketing hospitality ideas implemented well
