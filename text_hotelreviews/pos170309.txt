the staff could not have been any more obliging and helpful the location was excellent and great places to eat nearby the hotel s recommendation of a local authentic french restaurant was spot on and we had a fabulous meal out the room was huge for paris and really well appointed even though it was on a main road it was quiet even with the door to the balcony open
