the door man when we arrived did not help us at all with our cases i have a weak right arm and my wife suffers from arthritis the door of our room could only just be opened as the bed was across the room blocking our overall entry there was about inches to get passed the bed so our suitcases had to be lifted over the bed to get them into the room the kettle for hot water was broken and would not work and although our checkout was hrs the next day builders started work at hours just outside our room so we were woken up by loud voices and building work going on we were given a percent reduction on our bill when i complained and an offer of an upgrade if we book again which i think is derisory for what we put up with also they offered a bottle of champagne we don t drink i am a very unhappy customer
