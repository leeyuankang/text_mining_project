bed was amazing staff were friendly and helpful and with it being a few minutes from victoria station it was very convenient managed to get a room swap was expecting a bath but got a shower and the next day not only was my room swapped but they moved my luggage too also people opening the door for you at the main doors was lovely a main bin and a recycling bin were excellent additions
