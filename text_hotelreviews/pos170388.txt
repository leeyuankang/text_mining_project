i got great rate by booking early rooms are on small side but very well equipped and very comfortable i booked a superior king room which i was a little disappointed with at first but when i said that to the receptionist who had called to ask if everything was ok with the room she offered to let me see two others instead and happily moved us at breakfast there is a hot buffet but no a la carte but when i asked if they could do salmon and poached eggs for my daughter who doesn t eat meat they very happily did staff couldn t be more helpful also doorman and concierge great nights sleep fantastic bedding and pillows great location for victoria wicked we would stay here again
