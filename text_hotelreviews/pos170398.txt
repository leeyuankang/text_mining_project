everything about this hotel was great staff were very pleasant from the moment we arrived to moment we left they made sure we were settled and enjoying our stay facilities were top notch and very comfortable they did mention that they were going to have a refurbishment in following weeks location was amazing short walks away from the main attractions underground close enough if you don t want to walk i would recommend this hotel to anyone very impressed
