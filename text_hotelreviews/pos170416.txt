we have stayed at the rubens on many occasions and found the staff very friendly and helpful it is one of our favourite london hotels in a very good location only a short walk to victoria station and bus stop the london tour bus stops outside the hotel we have read comments about difficulty parking we find it easy to park behind the hotel and let the concierge take the car to a secure car park
