the entire decoration is a bit old style so it took me some time to get use to everything but the room is very comfortable clean and make me feel at home the bed is superb actually i can t sleep very well for many years in rubens the bed and the entire environment is so relaxing that i had three nights very good sleep the staff is very kind extremely convenient walk to victoria station bar restaurant downstairs the breakfast absolutely impressive i mean everybody know british food is not so human friendly the rubens did their best to make it good try it and you won t regret it worth the money wifi speed is good and it is free i will choose rubens again very nice place very nice
