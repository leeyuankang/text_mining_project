the breakfasts were first class and set us up for the day nothing was too much trouble for any staff member who were all happy friendly and polite we would definitely like to come back again and stay at the rubens at the palace when we have saved up again for a lovely weekend away as busy working as carers we don t often get the chance to have time off and be spoilt with such luxurious hotels so this was a real treat and a tonic for us both thank you very much
