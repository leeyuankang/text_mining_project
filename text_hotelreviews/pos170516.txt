the location of the hotel is superb close to all the major tourist attractions ie minutes to buckingham palace and about minutes walk to trafalgar square covent gardens etc the hotel felt like a star hotel and our stay was enhanced by getting our room upgraded to a suite very helpful staff who arranged for our luggage to be stored for several hours before our booking in time and for several hours after we had booked out
