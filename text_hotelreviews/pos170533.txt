everything the staff especially lydia couldnt have been more helpful friendly and professional the super jolly doormen the housekeeping staff everybody we met made us feel welcome and a bit special actually the room was immaculate with lovely decor the whole hotel has such a lovely feel to it we came to london to see a show so the location is perfect very near the tube station and a short walk to the train and bus station we will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel excellent all round
