when i arrived at my room was ready and available fantastic i was meeting my son at the theatre to watch his showcase as a final year student at the royal conservatoire of scotland i dropped my case off at the room and left immediately the room appeared to meet all my expectations we returned at to find that another guest was settled in my room at the exact time i arrived back and tried to enter the room the other guest was just leaving after our initial shock and dismay one member of staff was particularly helpful and apologetic after viewing rooms that were unsuitable we were given a room upgrade we were also given a complimentary box of biscuits and a voucher for a drink in the bar the alternative room was splendid
