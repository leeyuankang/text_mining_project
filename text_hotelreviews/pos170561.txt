we have stayed at the rubens twice before so booked a third visit last weekend we where upgraded on our room which was really lovely very cosy and the decor added a boutique feel the breakfast was really good however we ate out every night so didnt get to experience the evening meal the bar was very quiet but had a nice atmosphere and again the staff are attentive we like the overall feel of the hotel as its quite traditional keeping with the london theme and not trying to be trendy or corporate we will defiantly stay at the rubens again in the future
