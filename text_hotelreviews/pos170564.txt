the overall comfort was excellent we love the breakfast choices are so good and very relaxed nothing is too much trouble for these people even given directions to bus stops and tube stations as we like to see the city by public transport and there advice was invaluable thankyou so much yet again for a wonderful stay at your lovely hotel x
