my husband surprised me with this stay for our anniversary valentines on arrival we were dealt with quickly and in our room was a beautiful cake and happy anniversary written in chocolate plus a card within minutes we received a courtesy call to make sure we had found our room and we re happy with it the room was quiet warm and had everything we needed plus extras we didn t expect like dressing gowns and slippers the breakfast was amazing fresh eggs cooked while we waited and a choice of cooked breakfast fruit pastries continental and normal cereals we sat in plush high backed chairs and the waiter service was perfect all in all i couldn t fault it
