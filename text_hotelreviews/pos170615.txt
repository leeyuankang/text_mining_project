the staff was super friendly and helpful the english breakfast is worth every penny wow the decor is different from room to room you almost want to change rooms every day to see what you get extremely close to buckinham palace front yard for changing of the guard minute walk only a block from a major tube station their national mall and lots of gift stores best water pressure ever regretted coming home to our shitty shower after this tbh we are talking under minutes to draw a bath and enough hot water to boil a heard of elephants we are talking endless hot water
