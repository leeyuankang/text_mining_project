staff were very polite room was a great size for central london was given a voucher for a free drink at the bar on arrival i asked for a room with a view and was given a front facing room was worried that being near the lifts would be noisy but didn t hear another person all night amazing location and value for money if i m out in london again i wouldn t hesitate to book again
