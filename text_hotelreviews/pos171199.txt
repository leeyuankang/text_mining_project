the location of the hotel is excellent for those that want a place with walking distance to all the attractions restaurants and theatre shows the hotel is very clean the linens are washed and changed everyday the cleaning staff is always on time to clean and are very professional they clean and pack your stuff away making you feel comfortable and at home the room is sound proof and the bed is large and comfortable i love the layout of the hotel and the interior design it is modern but also still gives you that feeling of britain
