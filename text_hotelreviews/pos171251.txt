perfect location from this hotel one can consider taking buses rather than the tube and from nearby trafalgar square go to many of london s sights the national gallery is less than five minutes by walking the room is very clean albeit small the staff were so kind and courteous giving me whatever i needed unexpectedly even a aaa battery a small thing but i was pleasantly surprised
