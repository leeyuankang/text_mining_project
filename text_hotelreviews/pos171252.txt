the location is perfect for shopping finding a restaurant whatever your favorite cooking is going to theatres or museums just by walking or simply enjoying a beer in soho the staff is a really competent and professional team always ready and willing to help you with a smile the room was rather large quiet and comfortable excellent bedding wifi works very well we will return to this hotel for our next stay in london
