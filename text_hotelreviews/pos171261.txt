i am impressed about this hotel on a lot of areas excellent location which is just few steps to the piccadily circus station which has a direct line to and from healthrow airport and close to a lot of tourist areas in london room was of decent size and staff were really friendly and accommodating but what im truly impressed about was that we arrived before and we re allowed to checkin early as per my request
