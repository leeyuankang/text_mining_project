the staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming we travelled with my elderly parents and requested rooms close together close to lifts and on lower floors and all needs were met the staff couldn t do enough for you they are the real credit of the hotel the location is right in the thick of it between piccadilly and leicester square and close to taxi ranks and tube the rooms are comfortable and quite spacious for central london and clean coffee machines in the rooms and the complimentary fridge is a fantastic idea really appreciated that touch breakfast was great plenty of it and delicious and catered for all overall couldn t fault it it was quite expensive but worth it for the comfort location and the excellent staff
