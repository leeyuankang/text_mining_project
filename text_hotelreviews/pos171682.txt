the location is great the underground station and bus stop is just around the corner and surrounded by restaurants and tesco though it s not in the heart of london but it s really easy to take the underground to everywhere or actually hyde park is just within minute walking distance if you don t mind exploring by walking the neighborhood is quite and great we were upgrated to the club level the room is big and nice
