amazed at the luxurious nature of this hotel for the price we paid spacious rooms good selection of toiletries selection of big fluffy towels iron and board two hairdryers and coffee tea and biscuits in the room there were loads of lifts also the smart entrance with uniformed footmen made me think i d walked in to the wrong hotel or was mistaken about the price would definitely return as it was very convenient for the albert hall and museums and only a few minutes walk from the tube
