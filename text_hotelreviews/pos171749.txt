great location close to tube and attractions museums and royal albert hall very helpful and accommodating staff we arrived to be initially disappointed with our room clearly an overspill room which hadnt been used for sometime as thick dust was evident in bathroom and on bedroom furniture staff very quick to offer us a clean room and upgraded us as gesture of goodwill
