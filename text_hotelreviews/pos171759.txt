the warm welcome by the doorman and reception as well as the prompt check in the staff in the dining room at breakfast were very pleasant and helpful the room was huge with a quaint dresssing area i liked the extra security in the lifts the room key had to be placed in the allocated area before the lift was activated from the ground floor pleasant music in the foyer
