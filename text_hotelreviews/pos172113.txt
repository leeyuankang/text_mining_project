we especially liked the bar where we would always end our hectic days with a relaxing drink or two the bartender joanna and waiter david were extremely friendly and accommodating and always greeted us with a smile the cocktails were delicious we always looked forward to ending our evening with them the concierge nik was always eager to provide help and suggestions when asked i would definitely recommend this facility
