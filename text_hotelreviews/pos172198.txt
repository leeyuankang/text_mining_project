i stayed just one night with my daughter to see a concert in hyde park the beds were very comfortable with nice pillows i liked the fact that they had earl grey tea in the room not all hotels do all staff greeted us with smiles and were very polite we arrived early and were allocated a room straight away great location as tube station is only a few minutes away with plenty of food retailers nearby
