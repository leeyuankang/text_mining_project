everything was fine but rooms heating broken so night one was very cold had to move rooms for a second time first move being caused through failure to allow for my inability to walk far as per my booking request for room on ground floor or near lift a room allocated floor and at the end of a very long corridor everything was taken care of in reporting to front desk it was an inconvenience but it didn t completely spoil our stay
