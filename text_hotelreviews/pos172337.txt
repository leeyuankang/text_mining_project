the location was perfect tube next door a few nice restaurants and lots of places within walking distance the hotel was amazing first class staff except for check in everyone very polite and helpful the room was a good size not exceptional but nice lovely bed bathroom was in need of an update but it had everything we needed breakfast was absolute lovely amazing choices for hot and cold my husband had a full english and i tried their bread fruits pancakes etc and we both enjoyed it one of the reason we choose millennium chain is because of the club room and it didn t disappoint lovely croissants and homemade cookies all day juice and coffee tea there were hours with canap s and drinks this was a great surprise and we tried it all and thoroughly enjoyed it we will continue to choose the millennium chain when staying in london and hope the check in experience was a one off
