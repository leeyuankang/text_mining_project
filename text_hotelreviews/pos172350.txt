fantastic location close to museums restaurants tube etc booked a millennium club room so got access to club lounge which while a touch on the cramped side was excellent really relaxing between and after a day out and about the bed was top class best night s sleep we had in any hotel we ve been in for years we had breakfast in the club lounge for the first morning but the breakfast range in the main restaurant on the ground floor was really comprehensive and tasty i would consider paying the extra for millennium club again as it included breakfast club lounge and wifi range of tv channels in club room was top class including sky sports
