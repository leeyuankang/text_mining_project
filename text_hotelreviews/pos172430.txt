the location is quite good and this is literally the only thing that this hotel supposedly star has in its favour the staff are overworked unhappy the rooms needed refurbing years ago no mini bar tv doesn t work and as per many other guest comments internet doesn t work add to that the breakfast is cold again as per many other guests then my advise is firmly to find another hotel in same location near by
