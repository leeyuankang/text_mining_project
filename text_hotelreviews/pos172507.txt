we always stay at this hotel during our annual december visit to london december so we sort of feel at home in it the location is excellent across the street from gloucester rd tube station on the piccadilly and district lines walking distance to the museums and the royal albert hall staff are helpful and polite good breakfast in a nice setting nice lobby and bar areas
