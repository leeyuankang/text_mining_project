ideally situated for the underground with most journeys into the city centre being straight forward our room was very clean comfortable and above all quiet which we hadn t expected the staff were friendly and helpful and let us store our cases on the last day which was useful we were very pleased with our choice of hotel and we would definitely stay here again
