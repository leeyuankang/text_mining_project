fabulous location just a minute away from gloucester road tube station and good bus links we went in early december so everything was trimmed up very nicely for christmas the staff were very friendly and courteous at all times we got a deal on the breakfast instead of the usual and it was very good overall but could have been a bit hotter and the fruit juice orange was a bit weak
