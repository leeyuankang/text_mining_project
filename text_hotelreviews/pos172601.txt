location adjacent to the gloucester road tube stop is ideal for easy transportation acess to anywhere in central london offered a modestly priced upgrade on check in that included breakfast king sized bed and wireless internet access which were well worth the premium this is our second stay at this hotel over the past five trips to london and we would recommend it for its convenience and good value
