the hotel is amazing beautiful interior we weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof our room was fantastic the only thing i should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below the room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush
