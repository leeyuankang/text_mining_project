the hotel is super cute and artsy close to the eiffel tower and nearby shopping i booked for a club room but got upgraded to a junior suite so my room was spacious and the bathroom was very clean and tiles were so pretty the bed is by far one of the most comfy beds i have experienced in a hotel i ll definitely go back
