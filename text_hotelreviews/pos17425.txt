from the moment we arrived to the time we left the hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful providing us with directions and attending to our every need the rooms were spotlessly clean which is a very big deal to us the bed was big warm and comfortable thereby giving us wonderful nights of restful sleep we will definitely be coming back to stay at hotel juliana again
