we did not have a good experience with holiday inn last time we stayed in paris so we decided we would book a hotel with nicer and comfortable room we browsed booking com and found this novotel closer to where i had to attend a conference and the pictures of the rooms looked really good when we reached there the actual room surpassed our expectations it was very spacious and very clean pretty much comparable to a the shower and bath was very clean and spacious and the drainage system was really good which is often not good in hotels they cleaned the room everyday and topped up the tea bar too the ambience of the lobby and hotel rooms is very nice we stayed with two kids and even though there was extra bed for kids there was ample space metro is just outside and it takes you directly to champs lys es connects you to other lines that take you directly to musee du louvre or notre dame and other attractions so you do not spend a lot of time travelling staff is very helpful and friendly they even kept our luggage after checkout while our flight was late and we needed to hover around without carrying heavy luggage with us i would definitely give it a star an d stay with them again there are enough cheap restaurants near the hotel and really good bakery right in front of it
