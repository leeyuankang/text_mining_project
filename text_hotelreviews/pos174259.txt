a few steps from the main entrance you had access to the metro and could be anywhere in the city in was close to orly airport if your coming via this airport the rooms were big and very clean maybe even huge for paris standards we stayed in a similar rated hotel during our stay and was very small compared to here some people complained about the metro tram we were on level and despite some noise and vibrations this had no effect on my sleep and i m a light sleeper at the best of times a few shops over the road were handy for supplies and a really nice bakery if your not having breakfast in the hotel staff were always friendly and helpful would come back here again if we visited paris
