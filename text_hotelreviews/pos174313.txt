i was in this hotel with my family between august hotel is meters away from metro station porte de vanves in france especially in paris staying at a hotel near a metro station is very important we had no problem of transportation there are stops from porte de vanves to montparnesse which is one of the most central stations of paris and stops to champ elysees each and every staff was always smiling and helpful they both helped us about hotel issues and answered all our questions about places and transportation they were really sincere they also speak english fluently this is important for non french speakers to make the communication easier the rooms were very clean althugh the hotel is located very near to train and metro stations there is no problem of noise the size of the room was enough for us adults one year old child there is an uninterrupted and free wi fi connection both in the rooms and lobby area the check out hour was twelve and our return flight was in the evening we asked them to keep our luggages after check out for a few hours and they accepted this in a very friendly manner to sum up if i go to paris again i would prefer this hotel again
