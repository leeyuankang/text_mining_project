the location was ok i thought it would be closer to the center of paris there were traintracks next to the hotel sometimes i heard the trains but it didn t bother me my son loves trains so he was extremely happy about it when we went into the center we could take tram or metro we once took a taxi and it wasn t expensive we bought day pass to the metro trams
