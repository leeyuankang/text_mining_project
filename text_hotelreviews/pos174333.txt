i loved that the family room was spacious and the fact it was so near to a metro exit even though it is abit further away from the city centre it is still not too bad it is in a quiet but relatively safe area and the chinese vietnamese restaurant nearby was a surprise bonus the staff at the reception were good and especially one male staff who went the extra mile to get ice for my husband on a few nights for our soft drinks in the room he even provided an ice bucket
