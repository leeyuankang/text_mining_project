even if the train passes right by the hotel the rooms are well isolated and therefore very quiet the design of the room is nice and i specifically liked the idea of the moving tv as well as the air conditioner not being oriented towards the bed as in most of the hotels staff was nice breakfast ok easy access to the city center by subway
