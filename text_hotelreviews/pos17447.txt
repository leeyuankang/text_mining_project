beautifully decorated hotel with interesting features and displays of art we loved how small and cosy the hotel is adding a personal element to your stay the room was plenty big enough and the bath and shower was perfect loved the tv with the music and movies for free the staff were very pleasant and the hotel is situated in an ideal and perfect place couldn t believe how close to the eiffel tower we were we would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future
