we found the staff friendly and helpful we liked the area but it involved a lot of walking as we tended not to use transport unless we had to it was our choice it would be good if the hotel highlighted the attractions close to it such as the mus e rodin and had some guidance for good local places to eat such as ralph s and the place for brunch round the corner for those late risers missing the am breakfast on sunday
