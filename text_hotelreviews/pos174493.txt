good location nice old parisian building good size rooms for a european inner city hotel small bar open until late fair breakfast buffet fitness club generally friendly and helpful staff the metro station is just in front sadly only line to choose from but st german on line is blocks away the location is perfect it is close enough to st germain to be able to walk there for food drinks and entertainment yet it s blocks away from the main bar area so that it is not noisy at night
