this hotel could not be better located you can walk to the rodin louvre and orsay museums and luxembourg gardens bus in both directions is a one minute walk also within a minute s walk is the rue de bac metro and a taxi stand if you are lucky enough to be on the floor with a view of sacre coeur and you are over feet tall you might hit your head in the shower this was not a problem for us the people at the front desk are most pleasant and helpful i would definitely choose this hotel again
