beds pillows were very comfy so slept well we stayed on the floor and booked double rooms rooms which were next to each other reasonably quiet even though we were at the front of the hotel facing the road loved being able to open the windows to let the fresh air in reception staff were very helpful with any tourist information excellent location near to all the major sites which we walked to or used the batobus to get up down the seine only the sacre coeur needed a taxi journey location is one of the most important points for me and this hotel scores highly for that nice clean characterful neighbourhood with lots of cafes bakeries small shops etc travelled around quite a lot and were very happy with this area on our trip to paris would stay here again
