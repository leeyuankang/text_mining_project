staff were friendly and very helpful refered us to a fabulous restaurant nearby you leave your room key at reception when you leave the hotel on our return staff recognise us immediately without us having to say which room we were in take sometime to look for restaurants that the local business men use much better than the hundreds of generic cafes that serve the same everywhere we found great food and the waiters more than happy to help us with the menu
