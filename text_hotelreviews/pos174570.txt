we had a great stay the hotel room was modern and cozy with nicely designed spaces the room had everything we needed including an extremely comfortable bed a refrigerator and hot water boiler though we didn t spent too much time in our hotel room given the fantastic location we enjoyed having a very comfortable room to come back to at the end of the day
