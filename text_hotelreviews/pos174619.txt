the front desk staff were very welcoming and kind while as we arrived early and waited for our hotel room it was a pleasant surprise to have such a wonderful view of the tallest monuments of paris from our window from the floor the room was quite spacious and the twin bed was very comfortable we were centrally located so walking to some of the top attractions was very easy at the end of a very long day we ordered in and the food was very good and it was relaxing to be away from the maddening crowd
