room was lovely and very roomy the downside of it being in the basement was that there wasn t a window but it wasn t a problem as we weren t in the room much reception staff were very friendly and helpful we booked the hotel as it was near to the theatre we were going to and the location was excellent had to go out for breakfast but it wasn t a problem as there are so many great places to eat in nearby
