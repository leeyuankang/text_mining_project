location great just few minutes walk from covent garden market and attractions but all the same very quiet staff every one very helpful and friendly we could leave our bags in a locked room prior to check in room nicely decorated with comfy bed and large powerful shower complimentary tea coffee and water complimentary toiletries would definitely stay there again
