the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating we really can t say enough about how much we enjoyed them the location was very convenient it was a straight shot on the piccadilly line from heathrow transfers were very easily made from the piccadilly line to many of the other lines there were also a number of places very easily walked to the theater district seven dials and covent garden restaurants and museums were easily accessible while we didn t visit the hotel was directly across from the royal opera house there was a luggage storage room so you could explore unfettered prior to check in and after checkout we loved that the wi fi was included in the price of the hotel and they were very generous with tea and bottled water they cleaned the towels daily without an extra charge unlike some of the other budget friendly hotels we d looked at the bathroom was in the room and quite large compared to some others we ve had in london
