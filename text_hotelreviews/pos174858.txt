very friendly and helpful staff the electricity supply to our room cut out first thing sunday morning but a quick call to reception and it was sorted straight away unfortunately power went again a few minutes later but again sorted immediately also brought up a replacement hair dryer which appeared to be causing the problem we arrived before check in and were able to leave our case in a secure luggage room which freed us up to hit the shops same when we left and popped out for breakfast location was great for us less than minutes walk from covent garden tube and a very short stroll to the aldelphi theatre where we had booked to see a show also easy walk to oxford street regent street and of course covent garden just round the corner
