there s nothing to not like about this hotel the staff are always lovely and welcome you with warmth and with a smile we have stayed in two single rooms both impeccably clean and well presented and designed our recent room we stayed in had a set of stairs in that lead down to a bathroom and i could easily and happily live in that room it was perfect you have everything you need and it s nice to stay in a hotel that works on an actual key and lock system instead of a card that deactivates whenever it goes near your phone this hotel is charming in every way and is always a pleasure to stay in we will be returning again next january only criticism i have is to the people on here that complain there is no breakfast and no lift the hotel states there is no lift so read before you book and breakfast it is only complimentary for hotels to give free breakfast away they have recommendations for nearby places that do breakfast which is kind of them to do so most hotels in london do not offer free breakfast or charge a ridiculous amount for it anyways buy a packet of croissants make some tea and watch some morning telly together or if your travelling alone and have that in peace and quiet and at your own leisure thank you for a wonderful stay once again
