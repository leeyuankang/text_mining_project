we enjoyed the feel and style of the hotel kind of theatrical best of all its closeness to the opera house where we attended a performance could just not be beaten our room no was warm and very comfortable the bed linen spotlessly clean and pristinely white loved the steps leading down to a small area complete with small desk and chaise longue acting as an ante room to the excellent shower room the reception staff both daytime and night time were most friendly pleasant and helpful we would recommend the fielding to anyone wanting to be close to the whole covent garden area and certainly would return there when next at the opera
