the location was great as we were there for a weekend of shopping and relaxing we didn t want to have to go far for dinner after spending the day shopping and were spoilt for choice on where to eat our room was very clean and the staff we met were very friendly and it was very useful being able to leave our luggage there even after we had booked out i would definitely stay at the fielding again
