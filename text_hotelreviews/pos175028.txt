mattress was quite hard but the location of this boutique hotel is wonderful walk out the door turn left and your in theatre land turn right your in shopping heaven very helpful staff lovely decor and feel at this hotel some morning pastries would be nice instead of a breakfast but quite understandably it is not cost effective to provide a breakfast with so many eateries nearby
