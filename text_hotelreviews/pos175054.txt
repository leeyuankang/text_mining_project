the hotel staff were lovely and asked if we needed any recommendations of things to do places to eat which was great the reception is open so going back at wasn t a problem the room was clean and spacious and the shower was amazing the location was perfect only a few minute walk from covent garden square but far enough away to be quiet would recommend
