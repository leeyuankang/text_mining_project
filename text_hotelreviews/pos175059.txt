i arrived very early and was allowed to use the bag store so that i didn t have to lug a suitcase around the shops the lovely lady at reception was so friendly and helpful she gave me a free map of the area which was brilliant when we booked in we were given a room on the very top of the hotel which did mean a lot of stairs but also we were away from any road noise very clean and modern a joy we will use this lovely hotel again
