this lovely little hotel is tucked quietly down a pedestrian lane at the very heart of the hustle and bustle of covent garden we loved the claw foot tub in the room as well as a complete bathroom with large rain shower complimentary toothbrushes bottles of water and slippers were a wonderful surprise this marvellous little hotel helped to make our visit to london snd the lyceum theatre extra special
