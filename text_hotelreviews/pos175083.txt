we travelled to london for a last minute weekend away and booked only days before we were pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful hotel right on the door step of the hustle and bustle but just enough distance away from it all so that it wasn t too noisy the hotel staff are absolutely top class very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble the room was wonderful plenty of space and an amazing shower which i probably did stay in just a little longer than necessary the little extras just made it that more special like plenty of fresh bottled water tea coffee and hot choc and the bathroom toiletries were amazing along with a toothbrush and toothpaste which came in very useful as i forgot mine i would definitely stay here again infact looking at booking again for december to do a bit of xmas shopping well done fielding you get a massive thumbs up from us
