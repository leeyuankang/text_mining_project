we were going to an event at hyde park therefore location excellent it was hot weather and the air conditioning in the room was perfect and the comfortable beds led to a good nights sleep hubby loved the mirror in bathroom room that didn t steam up husband hates hotels but has said next time we are in london we should stay here again praise indeed
