great location for shopping in selfridges etc and room was nice size for adults lovely welcome to the hotel and the cookie on arrival was a nice touch the room was ready at pm and thank you for the bottle of wine all the staff were very helpful we would have liked a bath and a shower as the shower only had a fixed head the bathroom was cold as no heating not even a heated towel rail would stay again thank you
