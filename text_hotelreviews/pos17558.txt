staff is definitely the gold of this wonderfully and beautifully decorated hotel everyone we encountered was super nice helpful and knowledgeable and could put a smile on your face also the location is very convenient close to several metro stations and excellent boulangeries and eateries and we were happy to notice the windows of our street facing room provide good soundproofing from the lively french nightlife so you can have a good night s sleep
