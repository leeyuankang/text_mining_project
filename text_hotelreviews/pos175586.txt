i found it a pleasure to be there very thing was perfect and the staff were amazing i had a few steps up to my room but staff carried my bags on arrival and departure and could not do enough to help i could have had a room with no steps but they were not a problem they supplied separate wi fi for both devices i was using food excellent ac was just right and if i am ever in london again which is quite likely i will be staying again just around the corner from oxford street and probably the best accommodation i have ever had anywhere
