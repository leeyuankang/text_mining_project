the location was amazing so close to oxford it was practically on our doorstep perfect if you want to be in the middle of london town so handy could not have asked for a better place to stay the staff were so pleasant our whole stay was perfect and we will definitely be back i m not one to review hotels but i was so happy with everything i couldn t resist i could not recommend this hotel more
