i ate in the restaurant on my stay and the food was awful pizza had a mountain of cheese and large chunks as opposed to slices of chicken steak was pink in the middle even thought it was requested to be well done chef would be fired under my watch absolutely awful the girl who served me in the restaurant ask me to forgive her for being inefficient as she was under training really poor customer service not surprised restaurant was empty other than this the hotel and staff are really great staff on reception are exceptionally helpful and efficient the restaurant and it s staff especially those in the kitchen are what let s this hotel down
