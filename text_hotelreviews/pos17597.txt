a terrific hotel in a great location the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they would take the time to have a chat as you passed recption the room was extremely well appointed and care had been taken to get the design spot on i was particularly impressed by the generous provision of power points the powerful shower and the comfortable bed the purpose of my visit was to catch up with a friend who was playing a gig in the area easy access to the metro meant that the whole of the city felt close at hand
