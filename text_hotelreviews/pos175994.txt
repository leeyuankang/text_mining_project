overnight stay before attending hammersmith hospital for which it was well situated being a taxi ride to the hospital at in the morning staff were very helpful and friendly although service in the restaurant became less attentive when it filled up rooms were clean and had a fair amount of room but lighting was a little dim room had aircon which was needed on a hot night but came with the expected background noise sealed double glazed windows kept out the traffic noise as it is on the junction of some major mult laned roads restaurant menu was ok but but the food was not outstanding although there was far too much of it i would happily stay again if i needed to be in that location although probably not if it was at the full room rate
