what an amazing staff this was a great way to be introduced to london it s off the beaten path but a convenient taxi ride and tube ride from everything which is perfect for a new yorker like me close to the city but an opportunity to vacate away from the noise and daily grind great accommodations nice staff wonderful selection of alcohol
