we loved everything about the hotel we were able to check in six hours early and enjoy a cup of coffee in the dining room the staff especially juan went out of their way to be informative kind and professional our room was adorable small but immaculate we are extremely tall people but there was enough room for us to be comfortable the decor was such fun with many contrasting yet coordinating patterns of tile and wallpaper the towels were plush the bedding crisp and there were many outlets for charging our devices the bathroom looked like an advertisement for porcelain products we overlooked a quaint courtyard and kept our window open all night our street had superb restaurants outstanding and reasonable with zero tourism we never heard an accent other than french being spoken la fontaine for croissants and live music chez paul for elegant french cuisine foie gras cafe de la peintures perhaps the most beautiful restaurant i ve ever set foot in with its art nouveau designs all were on our street bookstores lovely shops and cafes were everywhere i will stay at hotel l antoine next time it s less than five minutes walk to two metro stations in the bastille area
