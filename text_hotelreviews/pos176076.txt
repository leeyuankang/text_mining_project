location is perfect for us travelling from the midlands its easy to get to from the we stay atleast once or twice per year when we visit london its the best place to stay in my opinion if you dont like driving right into the centre of the city with the tube a short walk its ideal mins on the tube and your in the hussle and bussle of london if it aint broke dont fix it i will continue to use this hotel for my weekend breaks to london aslong as it is standing
