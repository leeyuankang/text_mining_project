the room was nicely decorated with enough room for what we wanted heating was great breakfast was great too the hotel was right next to one of the ledru rollin metro entrances and a short walk away from the bastille station which made it very easy to travel within the city or get to the train station to go to disney there is also a bike rental rack right in front of the hotel if you want to use that the navigo pass makes it cheap to use everything if when we go back we will most likely stay at this hotel again if you re on a budget there s a mac and subway and a monoprix and dia supermarket right around the corner you can easily pic stuff up for a picnic along the sienne
