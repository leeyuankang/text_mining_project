location is a very individual thing for my wife and i it was perfect we travelled down from lancashire and it s position right next to the was brilliant we had matters to attend to in the immediate vacinity and also take in a west end show the walk to the tube took or minutes the tube direct to oxford circus took about twenty minutes perfect we stayed in an executive room on the seventh floor where the views of the city and beyond were fantastic although not used the gym also on this floor looked well equiped with modern facilities this looks like a relatively new hotel the room was reasonably generous in size and immaculately fitted out and maintained the bed was soft and very comfortable heating cooling worked very well the staff were a delight nothing too much trouble although in fairness we asked very little of them but even that sometimes proves difficult for some organisations the car parking was secure and under and around the building reasonable extra cost for this all in all a great experience only spoiled by the three hours it took to do the road miles to clapham on the sunday to pick up our dogs from our daughters the idiot who decided to close all the bridges over the thames and provide absolutely no diversion information on the day needs sacking
