the hotel is situated close to the ledru rollin metro station and not too far away from bastille metro station it is very easy to be reached the staff offered us the best service we received during our trip in paris they are kind friendly courteous and ready to help with a warm smile we were offered an early check in to our surprise we went to the hotel just to leave our luggage until the official check in time but the room had been just released and coffee while we waited the room to get ready for us it was a wonderful surprise for two really tired travellers the room was large enough larger than we expected based on what we read when we made the booking and impeccable the room was also quiet despite a noisy gathering of sports watchers nearby we passed by them on our way back to the hotel the bed was large and comfortable we had a restful sleep the wifi worked very well and it was fast i would definitely recommend this hotel a big thank you for everyone at the hotel who made our staying really pleasant and comfortable
