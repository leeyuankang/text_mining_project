we arrived at approx pm and need to leave again at for wembley for coldplay concert checking in staff had a queue of like minded guests and we felt nothing was too much trouble they helped us by booking a taxi and called our room on its arrival my friend and i arrived by london tube and the holiday inn was literally over a pedestrian crossing and five minutes to get to on return we could take tube to oxford circus and then on to the victoria line for the victoria coach station quite easily taxi to wembley was which we thought fair it was also much appreciated to find we could still get a hot coffee or a beer when we got back very late
