we landed a suite at the hotel which was huge anywhere massive for paris because we booked last minute we had a very good deal like off everything was spotless we really appreciated the outlets on both sides of the bed and the double door entry for extra quiet from the hallway we slept comfortably and could have stayed there for two weeks the neighborhood seems to be the paris equivalent of williamsburg with very stylish shopping and hipster bars breakfast was generous and it s a nice option to take the lighter menu directly in the room no problem connecting to wifi
