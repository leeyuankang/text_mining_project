we loved the location many restaurants cafes and shops in the area even if the hotel is in a hip happening area the hotel property sits on a quiet interior street the hotel is wonderful with beautiful interiors lovely decorated room with very comfortable bed pillows and beddings very nice bathrooms with fluffy towels lots of cabinet space for people the staff is excellent very friendly and helpful they offer a very good breakfast buffet with an additional option of a cooked item for a little bit more we would definitely stay here again
