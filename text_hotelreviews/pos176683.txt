booked a night while in town for our anniversary possibly because they weren t too busy we were given a fantastic upgrade to a penthouse suite beautiful styling great balcony views over rooftops which really made our stay friendly staff bustling restaurant and bar incredibly central for west end nightlife but still a peaceful and relaxing retreat
