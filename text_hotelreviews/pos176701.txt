overall the stay was very positive staff were attentive and very professional largely a fantastic experience i would stay again the bed was extremely comfortable and the room bathroom clean and well presented the restaurant food bar menu and evening was good quality although it might have been better to warn diners about the need to order extra vegetables with the mains thank you for a great weekend i have noted points for improvement but only to be constructive it would not prevent further visits
