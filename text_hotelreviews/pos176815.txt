we loved this hotel the location was perfect convenient easy to find and right in the middle of where we wanted to be across from the train station was perfect for our day trip to giverny easy to walk to shopping we arrived early before check in but the kind staff allowed us to check our bags so we could venture out and see the sites the breakfast was very good our room was small but just right for us my daughter loved the twin beds definitely recommend this hotel
