the room was very comfortable the air conditioning worked well which was great as the weather was hot the room was always made up on time and the breakfast was very nice and served in a nice breakfast area i loved having a fridge so that we could store water and keep it cool if we wanted the mini bar it would have been stocked but i preferred to have the fridge lovely stay nice central hotel spacious by french standards would certainly stay again
