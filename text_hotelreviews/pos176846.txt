the room was bigger than expected above average room size in paris very well decorated and clean things are nicely arranged and convenient the location is ideal near subway station and restaurants yet quiet enough at night with very efficient soundproof windows staff are great politely friendly and helpful the free access to hammam aka sauna is a bonus as well
