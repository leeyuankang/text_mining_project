the room was quirky fun and big by paris standards great en suite with decent complimentary toiletries didn t get the chance to use the spa on this trip but popped in to have a look will definitely make the time to use the facility on the next visit the staff were super friendly and accommodating when i needed to use the restaurant as a make shift meeting location and place to work from for the afternoon oh and i when i left some of my possessions behind i got a swift email letting me know and they were held so i could collect them later the same day all round great service
