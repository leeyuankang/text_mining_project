la tamise was wonderful it was conveniently located near the louvre and the jardin de tuileries both within a minute walk the hotel staff were friendly and welcoming especially pierre he went out of his way to make us comfortable and to help us enjoy our stay we even enjoyed fun conversation with him over coffee and champagne we miss him and his hospitality already my husband and i didn t book a room with a view but we didn t miss it as we spent so much time sight seeing outside of the room it was small but not too cramped the room was also extremely clean and nicely decorated the bed was very comfortable the espresso machine and fixings in the room were convenient for those mornings when you needed some energy before getting out the door definitely recommend this hotel be sure to take advantage of the advice and knowledge of the hotel staff pierre as they ll be honest and provide good recommendations book this now
