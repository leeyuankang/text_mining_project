the incredible coziness of this hotel was made all the more great by the friendliness generosity of the staff always being greeted with a warm smile as soon as you walked through the door the hotel is in an amazing location but tucked just far enough away it s honestly a hidden gem the overall d cor of the hotel was simple but with the perfect balance of lush touches the room was perfect for a couple with the best view the hotel could offer which was perfect when drinking espressos made in the room eating chocolates that were provided overall it was a wonderful stay we will definitely return again
