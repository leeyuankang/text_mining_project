the staff were excellent the front desk staff and in particular kevin was fantastic we moved hotels to this one after a poor experience and as it was our anniversary we had an upgraded room and kevin sent up a bottle of champagne when we checked in the hotel was very calming and the style and furnishings are lovely we also booked an evening meal at the buddha bar restaurant which is around the corner to the hotel this was done for us by kevin
