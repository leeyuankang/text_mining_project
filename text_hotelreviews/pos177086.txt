overall good value a minute walk from champs elysees however there are many great areas in paris that are also great besides champs elysees the staff was warm and friendly good location to take uber from as they can pick you up right in front of the hotel taxis they can request for you or you can walk a block hail a taxi yourself we booked the junior suite size was good for people however the room could add some nice touches as they show in the photos on website and booking com no cute pillows or flowers or color in the room all white for an art deco hotel you re expecting these sort of things but you really only see it in the lobby downstairs overall a good value for the money you get what you pay for good continental breakfast croissants cereal yogurt coffee very simple but nice complimentary water in room is nice junior suite is a decent size for paris for people
