small but modern and sofisticated hotel very convenient because of its perfect and central location just min walk to champs elysees desk staff was very helpful and had a nice detail with the tea time goodies offered by the hotel super service wifi worked fast and perfectly all over the hotel breakfast was simple but good enough since you can request egg dish on the moment breakfast manager was also very kind and with a smile on her face all the time
