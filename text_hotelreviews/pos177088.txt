this was our first experience with a boutique hotel and overall it was very pleasant and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel some of the things we particularly liked are staff are very friendly attentive and are willing to help the guests to their utmost property is managed really well and is clean and welcoming including housekeeping of the room and toilette personally we loved the minimalist design and decor extensive use of white and grey with very clean lines which does make the rooms feel bigger and airy than they generally are
