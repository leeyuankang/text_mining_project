the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble the location is great with nice bakeries and cafes close by we got a free upgrade as our room wasn t ready on check in and the staff couldn t have done more for us the junior suite was spacious with a nice bath and separate shower very comfy bed and clean white decoration i would highly recommend this boutique hotel
