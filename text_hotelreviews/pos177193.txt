this holiday inn notre dame was wonderful the staff was very friendly and helpful we travelled with our son and daughter in law and we booked two rooms with balconies with a view of the eiffel tower the rooms were small but comfortable the bathroom was quite roomy and the view was amazing we had days of sunshine and used the balcony every morning and evening paris streets can be noisy but we could not hear it in our rooms the higher the floor the less noise the hotel is near the metro notre dame the louvre and block to the seine i will definitely book this hotel again on our next trip to paris
