stayed here for nights in autumn late oct rooftop was amazing bar wasn t operating but you could take your own drinks and food up and enjoy the views anyway view is simply stunning you can get some great photos of the eiffel tower room was average bed comfy excellent location and area right next to st michel metro station that gives you a direct link to the palace of versailles
