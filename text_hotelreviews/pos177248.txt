we loved the location of the property in a great neighborhood with plenty to do right around there and walking distance to pont des arts notre dame and many other iconic sights the staff was awesome helped with making reservations and pointing us in the right direction for things there s also an amazing rooftop bar that we really enjoyed having drinks and taking in a beautiful view of the city from would definitely recommend
