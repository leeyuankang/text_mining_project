myself and my mum have just spent nights and wonderful days in vibrant city of paris i booked it as a present for my mums birthday as she has always wanted to go we stayed in the holiday inn notre dame i must say the location is fantastic my mum can not walk far and really wanted to see notre dame while she was there and it is literally at the bottom of the road from the hotel there is a big bus tour bus stop here so we took advantage as it was so close to the hotel to use it as our personal taxi while in the city we got a two day bus pass and a boat cruise on the seine ticket which only cost each well worth it for what the tour covers and you can hop on and off which we did as we were here to celebrate a special occasion i booked a room with a balcony and views of the eiffel tower which did not disappoint the view was breathtaking you also got the same few plus a little bit more from the roof top terrace in the hotel you should definitely take a visit there the room was very clean and comfortable just want we needed for the two nights we were there the best thing about the hotel was the staff especially emma and miriam on the front desk they were both very friendly and helpful even helping me with a problem i had with my return flights we will definitely be recommending this hotel and if sorry when we come back to paris we will be staying here again a very happy laura and mum christine x
