location of hotel is ideal for sightseeing and seeing the city we stayed in a room with a balcony and view and had full view of the arc de triomphe and the eiffel tower at a distance beautiful sights when lit up at night from the comfort of our room room was warm and comfortable and there was nothing i could complain about there is a main metro station practically right outside the door which allowed us to travel the whole city staff were very friendly at the front desk and helped us alot with showing us on maps how to get places on the metro staff at front desk also went out of their way to help me when i had trouble with tickets to disneyland they were very patient and did all they could to assist in the situation which worked out in the end overall a very pleasant experience in the belfast and would go back again to stay there
