very well located hotel boutique hotel if you are familiar with the cold bussiness environment where people even don t look to you this is your hotel if you are looking for a warm hotel where you can feel the people forget it the staff is very nice good concergerie i would put more enphasys in the arrangement and quality of the activities that the concergies organice in my case through booking i made a couple of requests and they were not excellent as i expected for this kind of hotel examples bouquette of roses with an inscription as it was my wedding anniversary the roses were old and not very elegant and the inscription that i requested to put i with the flowers was forgotten really a pity we arranged a guide with the concergie to take us around in paris with a chronological trip as said we needed a very simple but nice journey as it was the first time of my partner in paris above the cost of the arrangement that was exaggerated i was expecting even a super special and well prepared person the trip was as i say correct let s leave it like this my knowledge of the city and historical background was i think better we repeated the tour with one of the guys that makes free tours and it was much much better and professional all the respect for the guide sophie she was amazing as person but she didn t perform as well as we expected for the price
