the hotel is beautiful and located between the louvre on one side and the palais royal on the other even though we didn t visit the louvre we found the location to be ideal for walking to different places we were originally going to stay in the invalides area and are glad we decided not to the hotel was exceptionally clean and elegant yet not over the top very tasteful the staff were so nice and accommodating and helped us with all of our questions a simply wonderful experience
