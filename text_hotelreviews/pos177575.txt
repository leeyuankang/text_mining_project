beautiful boutique hotel in an excellent location walk to the louvre and tuileries gardens and the shops on rue st honore the room is a decent size given that it s paris but is charming and tasteful the bed linen was lovely and the bed was very comfortable as requested i was given a quiet room on the floor which had a small balcony and lovely views plus a bath tub the room had a kettle for making tea which was a welcome addition as many hotels are doing away with this facility all of the staff including the concierge are friendly welcoming helpful and genuinely go out of the way the can to do anything for you an incredible team of well trained staff who really set this hotel apart by making you feel truly cared for i ate twice in the hotel bar where the staff are true mixologists making exceptional cocktails and i ate what was without exception the best crouque monsieur i ve ever had you must try it a parting gift of a beautiful book just topped off an incredible stay at a very special hotel that i cannot wait to revisit
