we had a very enjoyable and comfortable nights stay location can t be any better with easy walking distance to great attractions restaurants metro etc yet the property is very discreet once you step in you find yourself whisked away from the crowds and noise i would say it s a good and fair slh hotel it totally met our expectations interesting pre dinner cocktails good facilities carita spa though no swimming pool friendly and professional staff very clean and generally well maintained property
