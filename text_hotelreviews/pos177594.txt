we loved the location of the hotel and its beautiful and clean rooms real paintings in the rooms rooms are smallish but do not feel cramped because of thoughtful layout very comfy beds we broke up our stay and stayed both at the street side and the courtyard side rooms and both were very quiet it is probably worth the money to book a delux room we found hotel staff to be very professional courteous and friendly the breakfast is limited in selection but more than adequate
