parisians have a reputation for being unfriendly and snobbish not so at this hotel where you are made welcome from the minute you set foot in the lobby to the minute you leave and it is or at least seems genuine the hotel is so close to the louvre you can almost smell the chestnuts roasting in the courtyard anouck a gem of a concierge my teenage daughters are fans sliced through french beaurocracy to serve up queue free tickets at all the main spots the private tour up the eiffel tower is unmissable as we only had two days to zoom around everything she also provided us with an insider s guide to restaurants so we didn t have to rely on the usual search engines and end up disappointed i haven t been to paris for years and thanks to this place may not leave it so long next time
