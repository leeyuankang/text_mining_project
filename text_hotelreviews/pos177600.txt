i arrived there at when they decided that my room was no longer booked and they bumped me in favor of another client i had no prior warning or email from their mangement someone on the reception was just trying to figure out which other hotel in paris to move me to even though i was in town for work for less than hours extremely unprofessional it s only after i became extremely agitated that they actually gave me my room which implies that there was no need for this whole story or added stress or they did that stunt to the next client who decided to check in just unacceptable
