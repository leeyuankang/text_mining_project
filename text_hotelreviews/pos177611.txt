the most amazing hotel stay in my life our honeymoon plan went disastrously wrong as we initially planned to go to nice via istanbul when tragic events hit both cities as an alternative we chose to stay in paris and we were somewhat disappointed with the last minute changes in our honeymoon plan but these guys at the grand hotel du palais royal pulled out a magic and lifted our honeymoon spirit up from the rock bottom i know honeymoon room upgrades cannot be generalized to all visitors but still the service and the rooms were just amazing and the pleasant surprise with an upgrade to the panoramic suite for the last night left us speechless and put the icing on the cake i will definitely stay at this hotel again for my future visits to paris
