the staff at the hotel were some of the most professional and helpful i have come across in a hotel nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay as comfortable as possible and the reccomendations that the hotel concierge made were excellent the hotel is in a great location being a stones throw away from the lourve and nearby to some nearby cafes and bars we had a superior rom and the facilities were very good the shower was great with a large monsoon shower head as well as an additional detachable shower for me the bed and the shower can make or break a hotel the bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very peaceful so we slept very well both nights also really good to see a full length mirror in the room
