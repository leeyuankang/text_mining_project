the location of the hotel was perfect i had informed the hotel that the reason for our trip was my daughter s birthday the staff were very friendly and gave us not just one but two up grades to a junior suite which had beautiful views over the roof tops of paris as a luxurious hotel it had a very welcoming and relaxed atmosphere i would recommend it to anyone
