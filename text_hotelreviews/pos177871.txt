the staff was very friendly the concierge was very helpful our room had a view of the street which was nice but the street is loud early in the morning it s a tight street the location is great for the louvre mus e d orsay and the rer metro which is what you ll likely take to the palace of versailles all easily within walking distance my advice is to use the concierge to book all restaurant reservations and to buy tickets for all of the above attractions the place de la concorde is also close for a great walk down the champs lys es to the arc de triomphe this is a bit of a hike but wonderful the eiffel tower is not close to the hotel again the metro easily takes you there and there is no view of it which might be the only slight drawback my advice is to greet everyone with an emphatic bon jour and then ask to speak english have fun with it it s amazing the difference you see in parisians when you try to speak as must french as you can
