breakfast was great value a good choice of food you can eat as much as you want the hotel is situated in a great place very close to the metro you can buy a day pass for zones and these are the lines to see all the major attractions all the staff were very nice and helpful nothing was too much trouble we loved our room and the bed as long as you like firm beds would definitely recommend
