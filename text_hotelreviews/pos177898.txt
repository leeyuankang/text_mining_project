excellent position to visit the city clean and big rooms a bit disappointing the view from my room which was a delux double i e more expansive espresso machine in the room and bathroom facilities very good value for money a part from the breakfast which was expensive euro per person but we didn t try since there were excellent and cheaper boulangeries bakery nearby
