the staff were fantastic ready to give recommendations and to go out of their way to be helpful special mention has to go to abdel who booked us our dinner on the sienne which was just magnificent he also recommended a brilliant little restaurant nearby where we had some really amazing food within a minute walk of a handful of sights and museums including the louvre but also located very close to the metro for easy public transportation
