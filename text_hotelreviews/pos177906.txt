the room was small but had been recently redone and had a large bathroom it was quiet warm and comfortable the service was excellent from reception to the maid service they were all courteous helpful and friendly this hotel has a four star rating but i have stayed in five star hotels that were not as nice the neighborhood in paris is the one of the best and located in st augustin walking distance from the madeline opera place de la concorde and champs elysee and half a block from the metro station it was a great value and i highly recommend it
