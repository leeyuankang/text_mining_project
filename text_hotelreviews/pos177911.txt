although i wanted an early check in and was confirmed the request when i arrived was told that i had to wait for a while because the rooms were not ready however when i extended my stay the staff were so helpful with my requests that i forgot about early check in ordeal i would like to especially thank maria and osiel for the incredible customer they provided during my stay the location is superb and the hotel is kept very well i would be back if i ever needed to be in that area
