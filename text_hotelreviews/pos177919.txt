staff were very helpful room was clean and well decorated breakfast was good a good selection lovely decor in main areas of hotel used app city maps to go to navigate which really helped us get around the hotel is as central as you can get to a range of site we walked everywhere and visited eiffel tower arc de triomphe sacre coeur notre dame and the louvre but we like a walk it s a stones throw from st augustin metro stop so was easy to get to using a map we got at gare du nord was changes or one change from st lazare but that was a bit more of a walk from the hotel recommend le cafe de la regence for dinner good service and quite modern but not too pricey it s on trip advisor
