great location close to the metro and only a short walk to the champs elysees there are a number of pharmacies and bars close by the staff were incredibly helpful and made us feel very welcome they have a luggage drop facility which allowed us to arrive early and make the most of our day and when we returned our bags were waiting for us up in the room also we had forgotten our plug adaptors but were able to borrow two for free from reception the room was really clean and comfortable and exactly as described
