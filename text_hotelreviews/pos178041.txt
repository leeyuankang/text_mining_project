the hotel is very conveniently situated it was less than minutes walk for gare de l est and is only minutes quick walk to the seine via les halles a great place to eat and wander i felt safe in the area although was careful amongst crowds the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and perfect for one person it was lovely to have a bath and not just a shower
