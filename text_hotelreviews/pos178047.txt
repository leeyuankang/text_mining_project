excellent location right outside a well connected metro stop and walking distance from major shopping eating areas staff was amazing had a room ready for us for a very early check in always greeted us gave great restaurant recommendations with an affordable price room was larger than expected just enough space for two people and our bags without restricting movement around the room highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in paris
