we live in japan where service quality is always very high so honestly we were a bit nervous of possibly feeling disappointed by an hotel in paris regardless of its stars turns out we weren t at all and the staff couldn t have been nicer and more helpful location is great and needless to say the room are impeccable and look gorgeous
