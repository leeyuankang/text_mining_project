the staff were very friendly and professional although they have a lot of customers and residents they give you the feeling and the attention as if you are the only one staying in the hotel they are never late your requests are immediately taken care of and if what you need is not available they exert all efforts to give you alternatives that suit your taste and demands the room had a very nice view on eiffel tower and the temperature was set to what really i wanted inside the room
