fantastic location most of the main parisian attractions were no more than a minute walk minute bus metro ride away we came in on the eurostar and it s about minutes away on the bus it s small but beautifully lit and sharply decorated oozing parisian glamour without being ott and i personally loved the teeny tiny lift though admittedly you wouldn t want go in there if you re claustrophobic
