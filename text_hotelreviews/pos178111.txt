i absolutely loved the staff everyone was so accomodating and friendly the hotel was a small boutique hotel located on a side street across from a park and train station and in the heart of everything you would want cafes parks restaurants shopping and a short walk to the monuments and other districts our room was really tiny for two people but it was clean and cute and it overlook the park a perfect view the elevator made us laugh because it was soooo small only one person with luggage or two people could fit at a time no complaints on our end the staff eas very catering and gave us information and called a taxi every time to get us to where we wanted to go i would definitely recommend for the price awesome
