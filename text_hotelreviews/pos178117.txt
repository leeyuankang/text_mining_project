loved the hotel and room decor very bijoux the staff were friendly and helpful and overall it was an excellent choice loved the little balcony for sitting on to look over the treetops with the eiffel tower just peeking up beyond having stayed in many parisian hotels over the years i d say this ranks very highly on the i want to feel a bit luxurious without breaking the bank scale i would stay here again and try the restaurant bar on site looked adorable but we had plans for all our meals offsite
