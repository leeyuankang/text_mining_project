very helpful and friendlyl staff the hotel was easy to find and steps from the metro and a grocery store the room was very clean and the beds very comfortable the wifi was free and quick we did not purchase breakfast from the hotel but there were many restaurants close by for breakfast lunch or dinner the area is fun and walking distance to many of the main attractions i would definitely recommend it and would stay again
