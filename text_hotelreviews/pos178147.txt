i loved my stay at the little palace hotel i was staying an extra night after my travelling companions headed in different directions it was easy to find the staff were super courteous and the decor was a little edgy up to date and very clean my room as i suspect they all are was small but completely adequate internally the designers have done a great job prioritising what matters comfy bed good quality shower just enough bench space for toiletries a small amount of storage plenty enough for a few nights worth of clothes and not including what doesn t little toiletries of low quality that i never use anyway i also had a balcony room that had an amazing view over the roof tops of paris including being able to see the top of the eiffel tower i have been to paris quite a number of times before and this experience still blew me away i loved it the location was great for exploring le marais and around too very central really i wish i had been staying for more than a night and would definitely stay here again thanks
