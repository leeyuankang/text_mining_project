i really felt like the staff at napoleonn paris particularly your front desk staff member suzy went above and beyond to make my paris dream come true i was upgraded to room and given the amazing view that i had wanted so desperately it was magical the weather wasn t ideal so after walking around in the rain all day to be able to come back to a beautiful room and look out my window at the eiffel tower made me so happy the food service staff room service and the restaurant were friendly and the food was spectacular i am traveling solo and this was my first time in paris but won t be my last and i won t be staying anywhere else except napoleon paris i am also keeping a blog about my travels and made sure the hotel name was mentioned in both video and print the video it was mentioned in has been viewed over hundred times and i ve had people email me to ask for the details i know you will get more happy customers from this
