we loved this absolutely beautiful hotel starting with the very classic napoleon era decorated lobby and rooms super comfortable bedding nice bathrooms and extremely friendly and helpful staff the best part about this hotel was walking out and looking to your left to see the arc de triomphe right there and eiffel tower just poking out behind it the champs elysees is one street away with lots of shops and restaurants very handy when travelling with kids we had a fantastic days in paris we ll be back here again for sure
