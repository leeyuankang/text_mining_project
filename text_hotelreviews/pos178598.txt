the hotel was beautiful and very clean there was the most fabulous smell in it the whole time we were there like freshly laundered clothes they had added balloons and confetti to our room on our arrival as it was our wedding anniversary and later on in the day they delivered cupcakes to us also the mini car is packed full of soft drinks that are all complementary as well as crisps and cookies the staff couldn t have been more helpful and the breakfast was delicious so much wonderful food to choose from it is ideally located for people who like to sightsee and there are so many lovely pubs bars and restaurants just a few mins away it is right around the corner from liverpool street station it was slightly more than i would normally pay for a hotel but it was a special occasion i would definitely return to this hotel
