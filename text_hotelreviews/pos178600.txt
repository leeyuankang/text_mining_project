the staff were friendly and welcoming it appears to have been recently updated and this has been done tastefully they also gave a discount when a couple of issues were raised with the room experience the location is convenient for the station and the hotel is well equipped with restaurants bars etc the little touches such as free coffee and drinks in reception is nice as is the free minibar no alcohol options though
