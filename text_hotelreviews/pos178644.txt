this was my visit to the andaz and as before i just find its always the staff who make the difference at any hotel i visit and as always the staff at the andaz shine like a beacon for superlative attention to the clients needs we arrived quite early no problem your rooms ready free coffee on arrival superb leaving the hotel they even assist you by pushing the revolving door for you a superb hotel based at liverpool street station which means that your only away from the centre of london and all the attraction and only four stops away from kings cross station on the district line a big thank you to all the staff at the andaz or their quality and commitment
