the staff that checked me in was great i cannot remember her name but she gave me a choice of the quietest rooms since i just flew in and was heading straight to work after a shower she was very informative and helpful the hotel is pretty different in terms of its layout and something i ve never seen before the snacks and drinks in the minibar are all free the desk that opened into a vanity mirror with hairdryer was awesome lastly it was quiet away from the elevators and the bed was incredibly comfortable my rating of a hotel will be most influenced by sleep quality i forgot the free wine offered at the lobby after i didn t have time this time but i will definitely be back in this hotel next time i have to work in the city definitely more peaceful than i expected
