location of the hotel next to liverpool street station was ideal and on arrival at the hotel we were offered a drink which was a nice touch service throughout our stay was excellent eg we requested an ironing board and iron and it arrived in less than minutes at our room and the porter kindly set it up for us we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hotel provided us with a card chocolate dipped strawberries and a bottle of wine the room and bed were very comfortable however we noted that we could hear a little of the antics in the ajoining room but that didn t blemish our stay other reviews have mentioned the absence of a mirror to do their hair and makeup etc it is located inside the lid of the desk where the hairdryer is breakfast was superb in the fantastic restaurant fortunately it was included in the room price as per person is quite expensive all in all a thoroughly enjoyable relaxing stay
