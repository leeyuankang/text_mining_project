fantastic service and friendly staff who seem to genuinely want to help rather than feeling a bit forced as it can sometimes do cleanest place i ve ever stayed beautiful building with amazing restaurants and artwork comfortable beds and all the facilities you could need complementary canapes and wine were served in reception which was unexpected but a great start to an evening fantastic location right next to liverpool street station with bars nearby
