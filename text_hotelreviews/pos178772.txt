this hotel is just fantastic loved everything about it from the staff service food checking in and the coffee corner on the ground floor well done andaz having stayed at a number of star hotels over many years the staff at this hotel offer the best service i have ever received all the staff from housekeeping restaurant and front of hotel staff were friendly helpful and went above and beyond in a number of requests very impressed the position of the hotel although in the business district of london is a great base for other activities as liverpool station next door makes getting around london very easy
