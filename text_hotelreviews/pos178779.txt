i d rate it more like overall love this location good for appointments in the city or north east of london also good for shoreditch spitalfields brick lane etc but also really easy to get to all other major attractions in the west end hotel is really modern stylish and feels pretty luxurious albeit relatively basic dining options are great but mostly closed on our visit but even eastway serves very good quality food free minibar always nice non alcoholic good quality bed and bedding
