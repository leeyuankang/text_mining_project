the hotel is easy to get to by clipper or by tube dlr it is really clean and classy and the staff are brilliant super efficient and helpful the facilities on offer are very good and the rooms and bar restaurant have excellent views of london i have never stayed in such a quiet room before and the bed was very very comfortable unfortunately we were there for ride london so didn t have time to use the pool and had to leave very early in the morning so didn t get to make the most of what the hotel had to offer our room rate didn t include breakfast but the hotel put on a complimentary breakfast for people taking part in the event which i thought was a really nice touch they also have an outdoor store for bikes which was invaluable to us
