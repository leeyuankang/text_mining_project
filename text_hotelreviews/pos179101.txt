what didn t i like it was amazing a pleasant surprise and with the lovely views and kind staff it was brilliant loved the ability of the rooftop bar and events and the area always seems good although i was only dashing from and to the station the facilities of having a sauna swimming pool gym was a really great surprise being included but just a shame i wasn t able to use them this time which is why for those two i couldn t rate a huge star smile the staff were so nice and helpful either answering all questions or the ability when signing in to have two cards as one is used for power to keep the hotel more environmentally friendly which was a good thought and a great idea the room was to my surprise just lovely two great window views a nice clean bathroom which for me had a rainforest type shower if you know what i mean the bed was comfy and relaxing the tv was huge and i mean huge and other aspects such as a mini fridge charging usb ports power ports the different drink options etc just really added to everything food for breakfast was good with staff to give you needed teas while you use the buffet and overlook a window seat to the sights of london
