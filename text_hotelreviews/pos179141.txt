we stayed for a night stay for my partners birthday it was the best customer service we ve ever received at a hotel not to forget the most beautiful hotel we ve stayed at also i m confused as to why it s a star not that star needs to be added on that s for sure we also can t thank anna enough for all her acknowledgement effort she made us feel so welcomed as well as all the other brilliant staff we got an upgraded room birthday card chocolates we were also shocked in a good way when we found out we were put in the vip lounge in the bar which made our night even more special for us there s so much to see do in this hotel we barely even went out of the hotel we decided we preferred staying in we relaxed by the most beautiful pool there s also a modern unique lounge on the floor that you can play games have coffee in and you can also head up to the restaurant bar terrace which is amazingly laid out with beautiful views this hotel will have your whole stay planned out it s the only hotel we ve stayed at that actually has a lot to do see inside we re so excited to come back in a few months for our anniversary as we know it will be the best hotel to stay at for such an special occasion it s also the most perfect location close to tube station very close to food places also a shopping mall what more could you possibly want apart from wanting to live in this hotel
