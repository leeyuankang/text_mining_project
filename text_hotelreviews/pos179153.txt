our experience was excellent at all times staff food restaurant bar facilities were fantastic and the views breath taking but you are a new hotel i am a consultant in construction and am lucky enough to be involved in works to star hotels through out london and the south east i know how the industry works it will be interesting to see how you run when your engine is run in to say years but you have made a great start good luck with the hotel we are coming back very soon for sure thank you for a great weekend kevin and lorraine x
