we really enjoyed our stay at hotel de lille it was in a lovely quiet location just down the road from the musee d rsay and across the road from the louvre easily accessible to public transport and walking distance to rue st germain there were lots of little restaurants nearby to walk to for dinner i would highly recommend this property and would definitly stay there again also very quiet at night
