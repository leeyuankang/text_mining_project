i thought the hotel was in a nice location and close to all shops and key attractions it is also only a min walk to the main c line that links to all underground tubes in and around paris it is in a quite road so noise is minimal staff were very helpful and pleasant the linen was fresh and clean and the rooms though small were exquisitely decorated
