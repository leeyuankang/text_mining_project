great location which is very evident from the city map to min walk to the most famous sightseeings but my best reference is not to the location but to the hotel personnel all of them are very friendly and of high assistance all personnel speaks very good english which makes comfortable stay for tourists who don t speak french rooms are renovated and cozy additional words about the location being in the very heart of the city the street is extremely quiet huge bonus the best hotel i ve ever stayed in paris
