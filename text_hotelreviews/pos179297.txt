i have to be honest this was my first time going to paris so i was very nervous about choosing a hotel online i was looking for a hotel close to some of the museums but not in the heart of the city with all this hustle bustle just as important i wanted a hotel that had employees that spoke english and was very clean especially the bathroom i m very picky this hotel surpassed all my expectations not only was is right down the street from the louvre and the musse d orsay but it was close to great restaurants and the staff was amazing very polite and helpful it was a breath of fresh air and i recommend it highly i would without a doubt stay there again thumbs up
