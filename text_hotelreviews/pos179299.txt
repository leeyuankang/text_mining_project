we didn t realize until we arrived that the hotel was in the very last stage of renovation i don t know what it looked like before but we loved our experience it s a small intimate kind of setting the room was affordable and spacious enough for two people and also our luggage modern decor room had a street view but was not loud an occasional siren in the morning but nothing overnight the bathroom was completely redone and high end equipped with fancy amenities including a hand towel warmer there is always a staff member at the desk you are asked to leave your room key behind when you leave which makes sense no risk of losing and someone is always there to answer the front door location in the city is key right by the museum d orsay and corresponding metro stop we re from nyc and like to walk so we walked to the eiffel tower another time to the marais but did make use of the convenient subway stop free wifi i had a personal and work iphone going at the same time and service was fast do not stay here if you require room service but if you re looking for a quaint very well located hotel with completely new and modern decor it was september so they hadn t yet unwrapped the gas fireplace in the lobby and want a nice quiet kind of fancy way to retire to your room book as we were leaving the nice woman in the lobby after calling us a taxi said we hope to see you again they will
