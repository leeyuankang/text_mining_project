third time staying at this hotel great location for train travel obviously efficient and helpful staff two years ago front desk gave us a room with perfect eiffel tower view this time front desk awarded us with a fabulous quiet courtyard facing second floor room that enabled us to sleep with the window ajar and hear the soothing sounds of the courtyard fountain late into the night very restful especially considering we were next to gare montparnasse within walking distance of great restaurants and all that is wonderful about paris
