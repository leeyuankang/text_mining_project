i stayed here with my mum for a night as i was switching apartments the room was very clean the beds comfortable and the staff incredibly polite and helpful the hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood although a bit more modern not the classic hausmann architecture if you care about that sort of thing well connected to some of the major tourist attraction by metro or just a walk it s great for its proximity to the montparnasse tower where you can get a great view of paris eiffel tower included overall we really enjoyed our stay we particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet so if you can select a deal that has it included might not be a bad idea bonus point s you get a beautiful view of the eiffel tower just around the corner of the hotel and in front if you are a looking for a nice typical parisian bistro dinner the cafe ernest is a good choice at a fairly reasonable price
