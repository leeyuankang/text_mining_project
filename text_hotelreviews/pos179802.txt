we stayed for nights and were generally pleased with the overall experience the bed was comfortable the toiletries were top notch and there is ample storage for one s clothing footwear also appreciated the kettle and daily teabags our room was very quiet consequently we slept well the buffet breakfast both hot and cold selections was excellent and well worth the additional daily expense lastly the metro and train station are close by which was very handy for accessing all of the sights
