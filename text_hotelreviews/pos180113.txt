the beds were crazy comfortable even the pull out sofa that my son slept on which i was wholly surprised by pullouts are usually pretty uncomfortable just as a rule but i wouldn t have minded sleeping on this one at all our bed in the next room was even more comfortable we stayed in a jr suite i liked that there was a mini bar with snacks and drinks these are always fairly pricey so that wasn t a surprise and it was a very nice convenience option to have the building was beautiful and well maintained it was clean and smelled nice there were plenty of outlets for charging devices as well as a well appointed kitchen with utensils plates glasses anything we could have needed the female staff member who checked us out was so sweet and kind and made us very comfortable we will definitely stay here again on our next trip to paris
