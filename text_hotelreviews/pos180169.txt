the rooms are modern and very clean no carpet which is nice if you are allergic the bar on the floor offers one of my favorite views on london tower bridge shard and is very nicely decorated overall the public places are nice and gave me a very comfortable feeling this time i had a room without view but there are rooms with a beautyful view on tower bridge try to get one of those if available
