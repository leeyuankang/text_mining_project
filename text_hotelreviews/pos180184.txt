absolutely great concept citizenship with all the perks and quirkiness really great bed guaranteed good sleep it was surprisingly quiet as well loved the ipad although has battery issues for room control breakfast was good and check out was the fastest ever location was on top of tower hill tube station and within walking distance of shoreditch
