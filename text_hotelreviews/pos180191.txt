i ve never rated a before but this place deserves a we had an uninterrupted view of tower of london and we were only on the floor the rooftop bar is incredible and the hotel is basically outside tower hill tube station although the rooms aren t huge the bed is ginormous and super comfortable with storage for bags underneath cafe downstairs wifi worked well hotel was quiet at night for a good night s rest would highly reccomend it s worth the cost we will stay here again
