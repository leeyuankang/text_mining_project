service was excellent they really went the extra mile for me it was lovely to stay in a hotel which had an international hostel feel about it but business clients i met some fantastic people just sat eating breakfast the rooms are perfect they are not large but just enough to be cosy and with ipad controls to set the mood lighting etc free movies only thing i missed was a kettle in my room but you have your own fridge with bottled water and they made fab fresh coffee downstairs and much better than a crappy nescafe sachet great location and all in all my new favourite hotel
