the bed was huge and very comfortable we enjoyed the citizenm experience immensely very clean bright modern the location was great with the subway just below the rooms were sound proof the late check out for a small fee was an added bonus because we were flying out of heathrow later that evening and could use the room till pm the next day the staff were excellent friendly and helpful
