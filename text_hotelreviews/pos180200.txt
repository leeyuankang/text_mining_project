the room was really well thought out with no waste at all on space the room also has lots of gadgets operated through a tablet cool the bed was the width of the room and up against the window therefore maximum comfort whilst enjoying the amazing view the top floor bar not only has interesting nooks and alcoves stuffed with books mags and an eclectic mix of objects to delight but also has a balcony that really impressed especially at night as the main view is of the tower of london and all that you can see down the thames the ground floor cafe bar reception is also stuffed with a myriad of interesting and arty paraphernalia akin to a gallery or museum rather than a hotel the staff were above and beyond this really is a gem
