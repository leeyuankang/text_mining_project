this modern ber cool hotel is not my normal style but i loved it it s as far from the classical luxury hotel as you can get yet every tiny detail has been carefully and lovingly worked out the wifi is astonishingly fast c download and upload at the roof top bar views are heart stopping the d cor is brilliantly original yet tastefully short of being over the top the floating lamps in the atrium and ethereal video game lift elevator announcements just made me laugh out loud with delight yet this is a great value hotel in an amazing location with the one of the best views in london for around a night is excellent i ve stayed in some really miserable places for that rate the cost cutting is extremely sophisticated in its implementation the small rooms are built with standard plastic modules and yet feel comfortable and high design with huge comfortable beds big tv screens and total room control from an ipad mini in the shower lavatory module the shower is outstanding with intuitive controls that don t require an engineering degree to figure out i really didn t care that the bars great music btw are only counter service because the bar staff were so good and the view well i already gushed about that staff are not too cool to be charming even to an old fart like me the restaurant is self service with a limited but tasty and creative menu it calls itself a canteen and that s what it is but that feels right from my experience this is by far the best hotel in london i m curious to try some of the others in the chain the ambience made me feel about years younger too
