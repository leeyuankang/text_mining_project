absolutely everything was perfect the bed was ultra comfy the room a smart room operated almost entirely via the provided ipad the metro was steps outside our door as was the tower of london the seventh floor bar overlooking all of london provides an unparalleled view of the tower of london the staff was over the top wonderful when i mentioned on the day of our arrival that it was my husbands birthday they surprised us with a handmade card a complimentary pastry with a candle two lattes and they sang him happy birthday right in the lobby there is truly nothing to dislike about this hotel
