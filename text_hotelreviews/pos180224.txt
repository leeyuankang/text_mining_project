this is a no frills hotel however the deco is beautiful the location is great and comfort has in no way been compromised it appears a lot of thought has gone into creating disabled access which is great p s we are not disabled this is merely an observation of something i was impressed with our bed was big and comfortable and the shower gels for morning and evening are divine the bar fridge is stocked with water daily very important if you will be commuting using the underground in summer like we were the lounging areas are equipped with newspapers books etc for guests use and this too is a beautiful touch
