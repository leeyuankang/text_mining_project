the easy check in and check out process through the touch screens the quickest i ve ever experienced the hotel is brand new so all the rooms and facilities are extremely clean hope they keep up the standard the location next to tower hill station is a big plus and the exit from the station is even closer to the hotel if you re carrying any luggage the lounge on the floor has an amazing view and is only exclusive to the hotel s guests so you don t have to worry about over crowding the different variety of rooms to suit different tastes if you like a quiet room like myself i would recommend booking on a higher floor outlooking the courtyard the inside of the hotel if you d like a room with the view of the tower you ll have to pay an extra charge the sink was inside the room which might sound messy at first but it s wide enough to prevent any water from splashing
