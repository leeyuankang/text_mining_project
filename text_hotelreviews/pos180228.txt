overall modern design which young travellers would prefer such as an ipad to control everything in the room from tv to curtains lightings breakfast has limited selection but great quality food breakfast is one of the longest serving hour i have experienced from good for laterisers who went late party the night before check in out process is automated so it was hassle free excellent location just above tower hill station and bus stop nearby and also the bar at top floor offers excellent view minus the crowd it feels like a hidden gem in the city
