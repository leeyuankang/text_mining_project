it was my first time in a citizenm hotel and i enjoyed it check in and check out are a bit unusual as they can fully done by yourself there is no reception like in most hotel but i liked that it s much faster that way hotel is nicely decorated and full of touches of humor here and there room is a bit small if you re staying with room can be completely controlled with a tablet tv lights shutters it s the first time i see this in a hotel don t forget to put the tablet back on its dock when sleeping as the battery will be empty by the time you wake up i had set the alarm with the tablet and got woken up by a creepy countdown on tv that i couldn t switch off because the tablet had no battery anymore good location near the tower of london and a few minutes away from the city
