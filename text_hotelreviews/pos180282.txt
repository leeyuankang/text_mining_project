everything was amazing from the quick self assisted check in to the comfy and swarve lobby area amazing tech savy rooms with an excellent bed and luckily for us a stupendous view over the tower of london and top of tower bridge great and well priced breakfast along with being above the tower underground line meaning easy access to the city on future visits to london i will most definitely return
