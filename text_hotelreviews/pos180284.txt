the view of the tower of london was amazing to wake up to the quirky charm of the hotel you will either love or hate we loved the ipad smart controls are fun and that apple aesthetic rubs off on the whole compact but functional room excellent soundproofing despite the convenience of sitting over a tube station the roof top bars views are even better the relaxation of the lobby area is inviting have a beer or coffee while hammering out a few emails the check in and checkout process was done on touch screen in the lobby so easy we would definitely stay again
