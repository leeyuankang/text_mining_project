we were looking for a hotel that was quirky and a bit different and citizenm did not disappoint located literally on top of tower hill station it really is a minute walk we arrived early and were able to leave our luggage to go enjoy our day and head back later to check in check in was smooth and you re able to choose your own room on arrival from those available we were lucky to get a tower of london view which was amazing the room was controlled completely by ipad temperature lighting tv curtain and blind the bed is extra large and was right up against the window so comfy the whole stay was brilliant and we are currently looking into their other hotels for our next trip p s the coffee in reception is amazing
