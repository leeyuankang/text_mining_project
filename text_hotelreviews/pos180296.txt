great stay i traveled with my daughter who was actually going to tobago flying from london we wanted to have some time together before her big university trip i emailed the reception asking for a room with a nice view i got much more that i expected on the arrival we got two complimentary drinks we could decide what we want they did not offer us a chip wine in the room my daughter found lots of balloons and a card the card was prepared by a lovely member of staff teela she made a huge effort as the card was containing some images from tobago and a nice story it was a great personal touch thank you the room itself is not very specious but it is lovely the bed is extremely comfortable everything is operated by an ipad lights tv there is a great sellection of movies the hotel location is great is literally next to the tower hill underground station the reception is nice and modern there are also computers you can use at the bar you can buy some food good selection for a very reasonable price the second night was interrupted by a fire alarm but this things happen i got an email in the morning explaining the situation and apologising for this i would highly recommended the hotel to everyone traveling to london for business or leisure and i will definately stay in the hotel again
