this is a quirky hotel centrally situated the rooms are very compact which is fine as there is ample space to sit in the lounge areas and the upstairs bar area from here there are stunning views of the tower of london a hearty breakfast is on offer and if you pre book it you get it a a discounted price the fact that you can control lighting curtains and blinds as well as the tv with room ipad was quite fun the staff was generally very friendly and helpful
