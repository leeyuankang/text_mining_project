i loved the modern quirky decor although the rooms are on the small side there are plenty of places to gather with friends have a meeting or even just relax with a book and coffee throughout the hotel there is plenty of comfortable seating the staff are wonderful very helpful the location is perfect literally right on top of the tube station which is great when you are transporting luggage or when you ve returned from a long day of sightseeing
