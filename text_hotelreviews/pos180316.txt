everything was generally excellent location staff even the rooms although small are ideal for a business traveller maybe not so good for a couple with limited storage space for suitcases this is a large draw under the bed actually a good space saving idea the upstairs bar is ideal to sit and work at there are benches with power and the wi fi is fast staff are wonderful and talking to one of the bar staff he said he was proud to work there this is always a good sign if staff like their work place
