the hotel is just metres away from tower hill station or walking distance from london bridge which is excellent if you are arriving from gatwick as they have an express train direct to london bridge it has lovely view of the tower of london and the bridge from its floor bar it is a very small but unique hotel which is quite quirky we loved the hotel and would recommend it to family and friends we cannot comment on the breakfast or dinner as we did not use the restaurant it was flying visit overnight for a medical appointment another perfect location as its walking distance from all the major and private hospitals in london
