huge big bed and our room had such a nice view overlooking the shard and gardens below the hotel the staff were so helpful at check in and when we checked out and wanted to leave our bags the room is controlled via an ipad and the tv comes with loads of good movies the bar on the roof has wonderful views over london and is nice and buzzy but not too busy because it s for hotel guests and friends only the hotel is right next to the tube station you don t even have to get wet if it s raining and it s easy to get an uber or a taxi later at night about from soho covent garden
