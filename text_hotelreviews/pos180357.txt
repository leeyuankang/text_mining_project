it was my stay at citizenm and again it was great worth every penny spent the hotel is located right above the tower hill underground station and is few minutes away from tower bridge well known city skyscrapers and the monument lovely lobby modern spotless room with enormous sized bed yes even in the single room the rooftop terrace bar gives you breathtaking view of the tower and south bank check in and out is very easy multiple self service terminals however staff is very helpful if you re having trouble overall great experience will definitely consider staying there again and again
