we love this place so so so much upon the arrival and during our stay the ambassadors were so welcoming and helpful the room was clean the shower gel smell so good that we have to get one home breakfast was great the bar has an amazing view and the design of the hotel itself is awesome we used to think of a hotel for just a place to stay but this hotel makes us wanting to stay as long as we could with a range of free movies and a comfy bed with the tube right at the doorstep you can reach anywhere in london or if you choose to explore the city by walking is not a bad idea at all we are definitely going to stay here again
