right by tower hill tube station with a view of the shard the river tower bridge etc can t get much more central the public areas of the hotel are outstanding fantastic lobby meeting area and lobby bar and a small deli where you can get food although we only got coffee the view from the cloudm bar is amazing staff are extremely helpful and friendly you have to do self check in which is really easy but there are at least members of staff helping you we arrived at p m on a friday night and didn t have to wait at all the lighting heating and media in the room are all controlled by an ipad the movie selection is good all free but there were surprisingly few uk tv channels you can though stream directly from your device via a magic app so i guess if we d been there long enough we d have explored that option
