fantastic location easy to get to by public transport and next to a santander bike hire station and cycle superhighway the room was very well designed small but with a big comfortable bed and the bathroom was relatively large the idea is that you have a small private space but large communal areas with a choice of different seating the room was well sound proofed i was next to the lift but it wasn t a problem the ironing room next to the lifts was a good idea as was hour access to food if you are jet lagged and want breakfast at you can help yourself
