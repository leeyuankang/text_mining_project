what an excellent hotel find right next to the tube and by right next to i don t mean a few minutes walk from i literally mean right next to tower hill tube station where you can literally explore the whole of london town location is perfect if the tower of london built a guesthouse it would be citizenm tower of london as it s just across the road literally plenty of restaurants and outdoor space around the hotel if you feel like grabbing something for a picnic a couple of stops away on the tube did i mention the tube is literally next door to the hotel and you re at millennium bridge which takes you across the river to wonderful southbank which is the mothership of people watching with a cool beer or fizzy mineral but it s only like a min walk from the hotel to go by foot if weather permits it s about mins to oxford st mins to stratford and the monstrous westfield shopping centre we flew into gatwick and stanstead both journeys were so easy and took less than an hour door to door but enough about the location the hotel itself is exceptional enormous beds i was a wee bit dubious when there wasn t a twin room option when travelling with friends but you d have to stretch out like a starfish to interfere with your roommate plus you ll be in such a deep sleep because the beds are so comfortable that you won t notice anyone beside you the rooms are nice and big so you won t be tripping over your shopping bangs in the middle of the night in fact everything in the room is big bathroom shower wardrobes tv there s a rooftop bar with stunning views and a hidden library up another flight with little cubby holes where you can grab a book and relax on some funky furniture be warned though you ll want to redecorate your house when you get home we didn t eat in the hotel restaurant but had coffees and pastries in the cafe which were delicious
