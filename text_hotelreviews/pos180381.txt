everything in this hotel is top notch the position is just in front of the tower of london obviously well served by any means of transport tube stop is just next door the room wasn t large but very comfortable and well organized the bed was huge and great to sleep into the bathroom was mirror clean and almost brand new with great attention to details shower head had five different settings everything from tv to curtains from light colours to room temperature could be remote controlled by an ipad the staff was friendly and helpful in settling every problem even if we arrived at am being also able to speak a lot of different languages the hall and living is gargantuan but cozy because it was furnished more like a house with great libraries full of every kind of book we didn t try the breakfast because it was definitive too expensive
