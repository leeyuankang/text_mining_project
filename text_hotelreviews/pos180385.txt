although the rooms are on the small side they are perfectly formed the bed was huge and very comfortable i loved using the ipad to control everything in the room lighting tv temperature etc we had a room overlooking the tower of london which was really special the location is perfect and the hotel is right on top of the tube so you don t have to go far at all to jump on the train the communal areas of the hotel are very cool and very relaxing unfortunately after coming back to the hotel from our night out we just missed out on going out onto the veranda for a drink however the indoor bar area still has fantastic views over the city i would stay here again
