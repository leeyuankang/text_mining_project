this was my first time in a citizenm and it has been great it starts with a really nice selfservice check in and even then staff is hovering around to assist you a very nice polite but not distant staff from the first beginning until the end the room is amazing a great bed a really well functioning rain shower with a massage handset mood lightning controlled by the room ipad that also controls the tv set the blinds and curtains what not complementary films to watch and a food offering on the ground floor what s more to say yes they offer a fine breakfast but extra special is the bar on the floor with a round walking balcony and an astonishing view on the tower of london you really shouldn t miss that so all and all i now know my new favorite hangout in london
