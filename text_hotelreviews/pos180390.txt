small room but that did not matter at all as it came with a very comfortable large bed and everything in the space felt fresh new and clean the overall look of the hotel is clean yet cosy and the lounge provided lots of quiet spaces if you need a larger place to sit i ended up working for a few hours in the lobby and it was a great space to concentrate also loved the supply of free movies not yet out on dvd make sure you pick a room with a view of the tower of london for the extra touch though
