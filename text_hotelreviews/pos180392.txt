this is a very nice hotel for a reasonable price considering its position it is a little different from the norm but in a good way our room was very clean and fun with its ipad controls the decor and facilities are brilliant and quite cool all the staff are polite and well informed the cloud bar is superb with great views and a relaxed vibe the hotel is just a nice place to hang about didn t expect to be eating at the hotel but the evening food lured us in on our way out so we succumbed and it was fabulous with a good choice we had opted to include breakfast though and it was delicious with something for everyone very glad we did spot on and we will definitely use it again
