the bed is a large emperor size perfect to have enough room to stretch out if need be the size of the room and the facilities included are effectively used and made you feel comfortable and not cramped the addition of an ipad to control all aspects of lighting and tv was an added bonus we also told the hotel it was our year anniversary celebration when hearing this they left free drink vouchers for the bar on the floor of the hotel it was a lovely surprise to find when we entered the room and certainly fantastic for the staff to have remembered when i initially booked if you do stay here please go and visit the bar at the floor the view of the tower of london tower bridge and the shard are spectacular
