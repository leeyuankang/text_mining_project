location was super hotel right beside tower hill underground station and the views from the bar at night are breathtaking comfy beds and wonderful shower necessities for weary travellers and after all the sight seeing loved the use of the ipad in the rooms to control lighting heating and even the opening and closing of the blinds safe provided in the room complimentary bottles of water in room each day stored in your very own fridge staff very helpful friendly
