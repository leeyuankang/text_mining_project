their location is superb next to tower hill station it was easy to go around with tube from that station because it was not too crowded on rush hour we could leave our baggage while we traveled to scotland for days a plus point front office staffs were helpful and friendly it staff also worked fast to solve the problem with the ipad in our room the view is nice if you can get tower of london view or trinity square it was easy to get breakfast around also for other meals we went to tower of london area to have breakfast by the riverside bought something before and sat on one of the benches
