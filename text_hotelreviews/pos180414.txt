extremely clean and a fantastic location yes the room is small however it s typical citizenm so every inch cm is used correctly which makes it feel spacious wifi is fantastically fast rooms are quite and the typical funky citizenm vibe tablet control of room colour lighting bed against the window etc friendly staff quality of the food is good and the view from the floor bar breathtaking if you are traveling as a couple and you are the types that like their privacy whilst using the bathroom this hotel is not for you because everything is quite open and the curtain doesn t offer that much but given everything else this hotel is a must go when in london
