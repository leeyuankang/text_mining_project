the room was very clean but i felt very clostophobic because of the position of the bed and there was no access to a window as i like fresh air i can understand why there were two automatic blinds because of the close proximity of other windows the lights from these were very bright and i couldn t get to sleep easily the tv channels were all over the place and as we are in england i d expext to get the main channels easily instead i had to continuously click through to get past other foreign channels the pillows were also really uncomfortable but you can t please everyone i also felt like i was in a self service hotel as i had to check myself in and out i i never saw or spoke to one member of staff the whole time i was there which some people might like but i would have liked some contact
