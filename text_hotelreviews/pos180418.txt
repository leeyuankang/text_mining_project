loved the location and facilities in this hotel i was in love with the decor of the lobby and the cafe area once i entered the room loved that the ipad and the tv screen welcomed me with my name written on them it s all in the small details the room was decent sized with a huge bed next to the window which had views to the tower of london no matter day or night the views from the window were amazing wifi was also fast and reliable and available throughout the whole building overall a really nice experience in a citizenm hotel and would definitely stay in another one next time
