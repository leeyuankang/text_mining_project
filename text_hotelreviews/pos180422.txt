everything about this hotel was superb i had good expectations prior to arrival but even those were exceeded in terms of location service staff attentiveness great wifi throughout the hotel looks fantastic from top to bottom room was comfortable what i would call fully functional and efficient use of space without being grandiose little touches like free water in the fridge replaced daily room completely left like new on day personalised touches safe for valuables and last but not least the views all the staff i encountered were fantastic you are properly looked after here now i m a signed up member and will definitely be back here
