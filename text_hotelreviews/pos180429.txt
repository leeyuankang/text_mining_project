great concept hotel with a modern theme their decor is great rooms were plenty spacious very decent size for london standards beds were big and very comfortable steps from the tower hill tube station very convenient food prices were a little high but we went out to a pub called minories less than a min walk from it that served delicious breakfast for pounds and had a great menu the hotel had a great view from the roof bar and very helpful and friendly staff
