i absolutely loved this place will definitely stay here again when i m next in town the rooms may be small but i lived in hk for five years so it seemed spacious to me the view of the tower of london was insane literally a stone s throw from the hotel this hotel is super quirky the staff are lovely can t do enough for you and the location is just so good it s for real next to the tube stop there are loads of buses but so many ldn attractions and places of interest are walkable including tower bridge and borough market
