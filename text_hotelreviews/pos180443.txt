the funky lighting and ipad controls were easy and fun the staff were friendly and helpful thanks especially for finding the ring that i left in my room when i returned later in the day they were able to reunite me with it in minutes thank you so much the space is interesting and comfortable and easy to use whether you re there for business or pleasure the views from the bar were great over the shard and the tower of london etc although the drinks are pricey is a shock for a cocktail for a girl from leeds the evening coffee however felt like a bargain at and was lovely having tower hill tube station underneath the hotel meant that travelling around is just that bit easier a great stay i d definitely recommend
