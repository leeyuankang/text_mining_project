i liked just about everything great new dutch hotel concept the location is rather ideal if you want to be close to the city and still have one of london s best views from the lounge bar on the floor towards the tower and the thames or stops away from embankment st from where you have everything within reach you do not have to walk more than meters coming out from tower hill tube st then you enter the hotel excellent when you get inside some very cool young people will quickly approach you taking you to a round table with a set of screens giving you an apple store feel for customer service and a choice of rooms excellent when you come down after putting your luggage aside you sit in a livingroom kind of combo foyer coffee bar restaurant sofa area with a good number of apple imac s at your disposal and space and colours inside as outside excellent the ambience in the combo foyer is like in the floor bar you can feel that people like to be there food and drinks are good and what was it about the price it is clearly cheaper than any other high quality choice you can think of in the vicinity excellent you will be a big question mark when you see the room as the bed seems to be almost up in the window until you get a feel for that the upholstery at the bed makes it possibly for you to lie in bed and look out on the thames shard scenery good thinking very unorthodox but it works
