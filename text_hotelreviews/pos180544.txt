check in was easy which is good especially arriving at after a long day didn t realise i could choose my room stay was a nice experience overall with a great view of the tower from my room but landed lucky i didn t use many of the facilities but i did feel comfortable sitting in the ground floor lounge area for dinner on my own which is a big positive for business travellers not sure i would like sharing the built in bed storage was adequate for a short stay agree that the hairdryer is excellent very limited tv channels just odd
