i booked the room because no on seemed to have complained about the lack of heating in the rooms and there it was a perfectly heated room with everything else essential in it including enough light and hooks to hang your towels and clothes on which is rare it was clearly made to make your life easy instead of fake luxurius no bed covers and no need to pull your sheets from under the bed when going to bed and no unnecessary fluffiness in the pillows or the bed without extra textiles the room felt exeptionally clean i was on vacation but had to do some work occasionally and the huge lobby was perfect for it just like a cafe and unlike a hotel lobby the staff and all the written signs were easygoing and funny and the design was very interesting all over the hotel staying at this hotel was as easy as being at home and having your favourite cafe downstairs
