i ve been staying at different citizenm hotels in london and abroad for about a year some locations have better access or better views but overall fun hotel the staff is universally cheerful and helpful whether it s a m or midnight the beds are firm and the perfect size excellent wifi and a total absence of room carpets nice touch with the penguin paperbacks including my favorite book alice in wonderland
