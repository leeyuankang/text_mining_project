everything was just what we needed quick and easy check in with staff about to help the room was perfect for a weekend stay for two they are small rooms however this didn t cause any problems the under the bed storage is large enough to store everything and the fact the sink is outside the bathroom works well the rooms are very modern and we really liked the little touches with the i pad the view of the towers also topped it off making it a perfect stay for us would definitely be coming again and have already recommended to friends and family
