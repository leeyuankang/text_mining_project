we really enjoyed our stay at citizenm the location was perfect and the facilities were excellent the room we had on the floor was quiet and had black out blinds all the features in the room itself were controlled by an ipad which was very impressive the shower was hot and had good pressure there was a good selection of films and tv channel that are all free to watch we didn t sample the breakfast but we visited the cafe near the main entrance and the coffee was excellent we ll definitely be checking out other citizenm hotels on our travels
