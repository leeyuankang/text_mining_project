this hotel was fantastic there is a self check in system but always friendly help on hand if you need it the room was great a huge comfortable bed was the highlight but the ipad controls and clean pod like bathroom were also a plus we hadn t booked breakfast as knew we could get get a cheap eat and coffee elsewhere in london but when we saw the breakfast and the lovely room where we could eat relax use computers we decided to eat in a lovely chilled night away without the kids and we wouldn t hesitate to stay at the wonderful citizenm again
