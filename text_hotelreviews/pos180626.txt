they recommended the tower view which is a must loved the view and the techy feel of the room the hotel is very hip and jumping also loved the hour availability of food and drinks at our convenience the location was great with a tube station right outside the doors there are plenty of restaurants nearby lastly i was a little skeptical about self check in out but there was always someone to help you with the process which we were new to would stay here again
