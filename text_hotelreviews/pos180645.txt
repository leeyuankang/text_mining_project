seems like they listened to consumer research and built a hotel addressing common complaints e g they offer free bottled waters the bedding is all white with crisp sheets and fresh white towels no long queues at check in bar on floor with amazing views of tower of london another bar in the lobby creative cocktails snack bar in the lobby if you don t want to pay for a full breakfast i didn t eat dinner there but there was a nice buffet at night amazing location right on top of the tower hill tube station when you exit turn around and the hotel is right there not sure if there was a gym but you can run around london tower and across tower bridge rooms are small but that s offset by great common areas
