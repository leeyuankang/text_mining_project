we had a room with a stunning view of the tower of london the staff were all extremely helpful we were treated to two complimentary drinks at the hotel bar and was even brought a slice of cake to the room as it was my birthday the beds were huge and super comfortable the roof top bar had a great view of the shard and canary wharf the hotel is central and was very easy to get to restaurants in west london all in all great stay in a very accommodating hotel i would definitely stay here again
