lovely atmosphere in all citizen m hotels staff are always friendly and switched on location superb especially if you get an exterior window overlooking tower of london window the bar on the floor is wonderful the views are fantastic and the balcony open to customers to take in the day time and night time views comfortable beds and bedding nice soft towels not starched to death rooms small yet they always work very well everything to hand with good mirrors and good lighting options i recommend this hotel
