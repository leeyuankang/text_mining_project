funky hotel reception and lounge more like a home from home friendly staff food is buffet style and limited but tasted good bedrooms are pods almost not the traditional hotel room but enough for what you need large comfortable bed great shower very clean fully automated room free movies i stayed here over a month and was a good location for the business and tower bridge district great top floor views and nice bar area would stay again
