the rooms are pods so ideal for someone who won t be spending a lot of time in the room the bed is against the window a toilet and shower in a module and sink in the main room loads of power points room is all controlled by an ipad which is both good and slightly annoying at times as you have to keep it charged great selection of free films but poor tv choice free water in the room and a fridge is useful
