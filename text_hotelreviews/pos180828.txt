hotel was at a super convenient location the underground station was just downstairs and the tower of london was right across the street the room was small however well distributed it was enough for me since i was traveling alone the bed was a king size and extremely comfortable the staff was very nice and accommodating just wanted to point out that there is no room service available at this hotel but it was not a big deal for me
