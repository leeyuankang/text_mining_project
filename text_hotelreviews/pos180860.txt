perfect balance in services offered room location and price the room felt like a cocoon comfortable fresh zen like the hotel has areas where you can work or relax it felt like a team of designers and a psychologists got together to create a space where distractions ineffiiciencies are minimised so you can concentrate on what you want to do whether it is work or for relaxation location excellent as the hotel is located above tower station with a direct line from all of the major airports heathrow gatwick city and regional rail stations i don t like transferring on the tube with luggage bigger than a carry on i prefer to catch the tube over a taxi room the rooms are small but the enormous bed i think it s bigger than a king and the large window more than makes up for it there is a desk but i would prefer to use the tables in the communal areas on the ground or top floor you get an ipad interface that operates the lights media movies tv curtains and alarm movie and wifi is included in the price thoughtful design as you have lots of usb plugs power points around the desk and it was something i appreciated large shower with rainfall fitting there is a self serve ironing facility near the lift area which i did use i am often not too bothered about the view from my room as i prefer to be outside but the large window that i could easily open with the ipad interface made it easier to wake up which is handy if you are suffering from jetlag coffee dining communal space i typically avoid hotel restaurants and the lobby but i used the cafe dining and tables in my short stay here these areas are decorate with interesting items which was energising but it wasn t too much to be distracting the meal area which in think operates hrs was very handy flying in late and i didn t want to head out to look for something
