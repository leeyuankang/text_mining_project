excellent location friendly hard working staff good price with a power outage the staff were under severe pressure they responded really well the floor bar has great views though it is very pricey we would definitely go there again hopefully there will be no major power cut the next time this is a lovely quirky modern hotel it is new and we got it at a great price i suspect that it will never again be priced so favourably
