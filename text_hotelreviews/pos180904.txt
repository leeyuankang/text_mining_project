great location for a weekend in london there is a tube stop right next to the hotel which is perfectly convenient when wanting to optimising your time moving about the city the hotel is very modern with vitra design furniture throughout rooms are on the small side however this is expected in central london and somehow don t feel small due to the layout also like they are green eco conscious we really enjoyed our stay
