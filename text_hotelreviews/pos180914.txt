this is a new hotel and the staff is very friendly enthusiastic and eager to help the common areas are fantastic lots of places to hangout with friends or catch up on work the room was small but very comfortable we stayed at the hotel for nights and because the space is designed so well we never felt cramped the beds are very comfortable and the rooms was cheerful and bright another benefit is that the hotel sits above the tower hill tube station we loved this convenience
