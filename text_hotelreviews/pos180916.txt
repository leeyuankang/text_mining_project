we loved the hotel from the moment we entered until we left everything is new and modern and has a very personal feeling due to the domotica used you can connect your own laptop to the tv we didn t even need electrical converters since they have different kind of plugs and usb chargers anything you wanted you could get there without hesitation and with a warm and friendly smile included last but not least since we got engaged there and the staff helped with the whole romantic setup at the rooftop bar it will be a memory we will never forget
