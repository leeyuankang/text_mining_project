loved this hotel rooms were compact but excellently designed to make great use of the space the huge bed and floor to ceiling window directly overlooking the tower of london gave a real luxurious feel to the room would have expected to pay a lot more than we did for that kind of view decor throughout the hotel was modern and quirky and immaculately clean staff were friendly and helpful would definitely return
