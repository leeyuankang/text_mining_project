staff were incredibly helpful and friendly being able to leave bags after check out for a couple of hours to allow for some last minute sightseeing before travelling back was greatly appreciated room was great and the view of the tower was a real bonus the ambience and layout of the ground floor public areas was great with plenty of space for all
