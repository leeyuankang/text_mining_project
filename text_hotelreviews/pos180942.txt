a brand new quirky hotel located right next to the tower of london the staff are really friendly and it is excellent value for london it also serves great food and coffee the rooms are small but have fabulous views and a big comfy bed loved playing with the room control pad the sky top bar had great atmosphere just a shame it was closed on sunday evening i would thoroughly recommend this hotel
