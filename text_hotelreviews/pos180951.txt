i am very surprised by this hotel since it just opened extremely clean and tidy all the facilities are so handy all the staff are very welcoming and nice and happy to help you with anything the room is a bit small but this is how it s designed the bed is huge for a room like this and comfortable the selection of movies available in the room are great as well the lobby is nicely designed and the reception is great for speedy checkout and the location right at the trinity square and by the tube and for this price probably the best value for money hotel in london
