i love how modern yet cocoon like the rooms are and how the building is old beautiful and well updated also love that it s a popular hotel but is supremely quiet and clean in the rooms the room service is delicious as is the food in the dining hall service is pretty impeccable i wouldn t want to stay anywhere else when visiting london
