the rooms are comfortable though minimalistic but they are really clean and nice i slept really well there and comfortably it s situated close to the tube which is great and makes commuting really easy plus there are quite a lot of really nice restaurants in an easy walking distance from the hotel plus mini markets for most food items recommended place to stay in lovely chiswick
