the chiswick rooms is one of those hotels that is essentially a b b without one of the bs breakfast the rooms are small but it has to be said they are clean and quite modern there are no services at the hotel not even a vending machine which makes it just a place to sleep and wash there is nothing wrong with that and i have been to similar style hotels where the rooms are minute the one i stayed in is just about acceptable in terms of size the shower is one of those corner showers that serves a purpose but doesn t give a lot of room to manoeuvre the bed was comfortable enough a double but very very cosy for two it has a small room safe which is free to use and a fridge also has air conditioning but it gurgled a lot and i m not sure how effective it was it is a good location with the tube nearby and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance so if you just want somewhere to put your head for a night then this hotel is ok but no frills good location and clean but pretty basic
