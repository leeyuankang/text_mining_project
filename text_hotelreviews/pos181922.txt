a minute s walk from stamford brook station and easy access to central london friendly and very helpful staff twin room was really compact but well designed and had everything we needed including a mini fridge we were out during the day and back late so the room size didn t matter good power shower and the air conditioning was a godsend since it was hot weather value for money in our opinion and we would book again
