i love claridges it is a really sincere experience unlike other hotels who are just ticking the boxes if you do nothing else treat yourself to their breakfast amazing the term the customer is king seems second nature in claridges they are just short of calling you your majesty and they are only too happy to treat you like a queen not an insincere smile in the place really love it
