when we enter the room we didnt like it at first cos the window face the backstreet n people were smoking on the steps of the restaurant across they could see us thru the window so we have to close it and the lights in the room was dim to my liking prefer natural light from outside but than closing the bind shutters we feel comfortable and really like the room spacious junior suite we were booked for superior double room had good sleep and quiet at nite would definetly stay there again
