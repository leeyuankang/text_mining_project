i loved this hotel easily the best i ve stayed in london for a similar price and i ve stayed in lots the dab radio ipod phone player was much appreciated although you ll need to bring an adapter i also loved the touch activated lamp lights the tv had a hmd input so i could also play you tube bbc iplayer etc from my phone i also brought my own adapter wi fi signal was good enough for this everything worked which in my long experience is not at all something to be taken for granted in london hotels just beside bayswater tube and a short walk to queensway tube
