this hotel is brilliant the value for money it offers with regards to location rooms cleanliness and comfort is unbelievable i would recommend booking the junior suite as the other other rooms are a little small but they are so well planned comfortable that it doesn t feel cramped at all the staff is very helpful and accommodating and we will definitely stay here the next time we re in london
