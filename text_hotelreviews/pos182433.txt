the hotel really went out of their way to make us feel welcome we were immediately welcomed into the hotel and shown where there was suitable parking after enquiring we were also given a local parking discount ticket we loved the room the ambience of the hotel was excellent really modern and minimalist and the location was great would definitely recommend based on our experience
