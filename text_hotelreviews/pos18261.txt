the hotel was like a georgian country house transplanted into london lovely room and so quiet i normally use earplugs in london but there was no noise at all and the bed was very comfortable a mobile phone for guests from overseas was a nice touch although i didn t need it myself proper hangers and a good sized bathrobe were a refreshing change the shower was very powerful like getting a rub down from a soviet masseuse would definitely recommend for people who don t want ultra modern decor and prefer some old fashioned touches but still want all mod cons
