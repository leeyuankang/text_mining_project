the staff were really lovely top location down the road from buckingham palace and gardens well dressed doormen add that special touch with caramels on the reception desk a personal favourite georgeous lobby with a traditional feel it was my idea of what a london hotel should be that you see in the movies breakfast was yummy too it was the best hotel that we stayed in while on our trip
