my family member was my mother this trip was to celebrate her birthday the staff were excellent they went above and beyond their brief for us my only concern was the shower being over the bath making it impossible for mum to have a shower i have related this concern to the hotel who have responded very quickly with assurance it will be looked into and proposed as an improvement to consider i am overall very happy with the entire trip
