obviously a very elite hotel with staff falling all over you but some other guests and visitors a little less friendly i got in trouble with a facetime visit that came in on my cell phone from my daughter back in canada a chance to see my first grandchild for the first time but someone complained i guess i was too happy in the formal setting also got in trouble for asking for ice at the bar for handling a knee injury while walking london all day they had given me a small bag of ice with no problems before so other than that a first class place in a first class city
