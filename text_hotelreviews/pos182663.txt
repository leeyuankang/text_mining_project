the hotel is very centrally located as it is close to many of the the main attractions rooms are a good size and nicely decorated beds are very comfortable which is always an important factor for us the staff are very pleasant and extremely accomodating unfortunately our stay was very brief as we were travelling to and from greece which meant we were only in london for nights upon our return from greece we were upgraded to a two bedroom apartment in the neighbouring buckingham gate suites and apartments which was fabulous i can t fault the hotel and will definitely stay there again when next visiting london
