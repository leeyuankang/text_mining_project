after we wer moved to a room inkeeping the the rating of the hotel it was fine the first night i had reason to complain as i think the rooms allocated to booking com are below standard you would be better of staying in a travel lodge i sent an email direct to the hotel whilst in the room and did an online review on trip adviser the way the assistant manager dealt with the situation was superb and our night was better than the unfortunately we were only there for two nights so couldn t really benefit from her kindness and efforts
