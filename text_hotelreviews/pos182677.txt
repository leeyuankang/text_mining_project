comfortable bed with excellent pillows fantastic shower temperature and powerful flow although would prefer a walk in rather than climbing into a bath but that is personal to me fabulous towels soft fluffy and very large and good quality shower gel soap and shampoo the room had lots of extras such as full fridge free water shoe cleaning and sewing kits high quality teas and coffees and biscuits etc the gym was kitted out with top of the range equipment which appeared in new condition short walk to the tube station all of the furnishings oozed sophistication and comfort all members of staff who we engaged with were amazing we had a wonderful time made up for adele cancelling on us
