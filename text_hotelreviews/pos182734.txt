i was upgraded from a king to a suite in this relaxing five star hotel the staff were all very attentive and friendly without being intrusive in any way making me feel really at home the victorian property originally frequented by aristocrats and other wealthy individuals has been completely modernized while retaining its elegance and is excellently maintained spotlessly clean throughout extremely comfortable and literally within a minute stroll of buckingham palace and st james park and within minutes walk of the palace of westminster both st james park and victoria tube stations are also within an easy walk
