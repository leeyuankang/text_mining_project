the concierge and reception staff were so lovely on arrival they overheard us saying we were just married and immediately surprised us with a glass of bubbles which was a lovely gesture the room was exactly as depicted in the photos on the website a modern room with unique decor much more homely than a standard hotel room the property is well located with many pubs and restaurants just behind the hotel on the lively rose st and within easy walking distance of the castle and old town highly recommend this hotel
