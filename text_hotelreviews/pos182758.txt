a gorgeous property old world charm but does not feel dated feels very luxurious staff doorman concierge were fantastic upgraded me without me asking so received an incredible room with a fantastic bed and huge bathroom many great restaurants nearby and although in a super tourist area didn t feel like a tourist hotel first class
