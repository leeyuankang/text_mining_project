we really enjoyed our stay here wish we had stayed for the whole trip rather than changing to the mondrian the hotel had a classic style and the rooms had a good size for london the bar was very comfy and the breakfast was good i can t remember his name but a romanian gent who worked breakfast was very polite and helpful each morning st james court felt like very good value for money in comparison to other hotels in london we would definitely stay again
