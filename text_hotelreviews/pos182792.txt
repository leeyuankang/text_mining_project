i really liked the location it s the city center it s also close to the bus stop or the station the hotel is big the staff is really nice and friendly breakfast was great i also liked that the room is spacious enough we could have tea in the room the only minus is that our room was on the floor and basically we could not see anything from the window it was half open though i would definitely recommend the hotel and will come back here if i m in london
