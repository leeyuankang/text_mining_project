the waiting staff were lovely and helpful but we couldn t seem to eat anywhere but in the bar which was limited we were woken up at because we could here the people in the next room talking all night they were not loud but the walls were so thin not ideal when you want a quiet room and a good sleep the bathroom wasn t very up to scratch and it was cold in there the room was nice but also very odd paintings on the wall which were not very nice overall the location was amazing but the room cost was not worth it
