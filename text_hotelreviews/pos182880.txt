the locations was superb just down the road from buckingham palace and the houses of parliament wonderful christmas decorations in the lobby sold it for me alice in wonderland tea looked amazing but sadly didn t get chance to sample staff were excellent especially concierge and the manager of the bistro would absolutely stay again
