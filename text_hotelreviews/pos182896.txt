we enjoyed the stay at taj in london very much we were informed that we have been upgraded to star suite when we arrived and my daughter got a nice james bear as a welcome gift all the staff are extremely nice and professional the room is clean and massive in addition the location can t be better we ll definitely come back again when we visit london next time
