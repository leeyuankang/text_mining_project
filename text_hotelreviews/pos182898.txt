first time in london on a very short one day visit the hotel was wonderful and the staff was very helpful very quite clean and comfortable the location was very close to the palace and big ben next time we ll hire a cab to give us a quick tour of the city cheaper less crowded and more personable than the busses the small italian restaurant up the street was great the owner was a delight to talk with
