the hotel is beautiful and you feel like you are in a piece of history we were there just after christmas and it was very festive the staff were very helpful and friendly especially the concierge and the doormen we had a classic king room with a courtyard view which was lovely especially as the doors opened so you could stand on the mini balcony the bed was really comfy and the tea and coffee facilities were good the location was fantastic a five minute walk from either victoria station or st james underground and a very short walk to buckingham palace and other westminster attractions there were plenty of cafes and restaurants around in addition to the hotel s own eateries
