friendly helpful staff we stayed in an executive king size room the bed was wonderfully comfortable the room large an airy the location may not suit everyone but it was very convenient for where we needed to be st james s park underground station is less than minutes walk away which is very useful this is the third or fourth time we have stayed here and we have always enjoyed it no hotel in london could be described as cheap the only way to sum them up is whether they are good value for money st james court certainly is if one books early and goes at the right time we think it is worth it for the well appointed rooms and the well trained staff
