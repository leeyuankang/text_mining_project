it was a beautiful building very interesting the room was quiet and the bed divine there was a lot of service and checking during the day so everything was perfect breakfast was lovely the hotel was very busy but always felt intimate there is a wonderful haird salon which caters to celebrities it is wonderful to be able to have your hair done right at the hotel
