the bathroom was a disgrace no extractor fan thus it was like a sauna after a shower no heated towel rail although there was a switch for it thus unable to hang up towels to dry so i requested they make over the bathroom and bedroom each evening the hotel is very pleasant as are the staff the manager did have the courtesy to telephone me after we had left to aplologise but that is not the point is it the room should have been acceptable from the start should have booked a better room
