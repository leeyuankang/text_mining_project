the staff were excellent available and always happy to help with a smile they offer real customer service with bells on can t rate them highly enough the hotel is absolutely beautiful very old school luxury grand building with a grand reception area leading into the hamptons bar the location is very central and everything you would want to see as a tourist is within walking distance or a short tube ride the room was large for london we had a standard double and it was cleaned every day with the chocolates refreshments and toiletries replaced automatically the hamptons bar offered some lovely food after when we got back from our evening at the theatre the quilon restaurant is amazing the service is incredible the food delightful we both went with the taster menu and loved it i was rather daunted at the prospect of eating in a one michelin starred restaurant but the waiting staff and manager could not have been more welcoming or attentive we will be back to the hotel hopefully before the year is out
