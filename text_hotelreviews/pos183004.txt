we have stayed here before and love it we had a corner room with a view of the courtyard which was lovely comfy bed and spacious bathroom as well we ate in the kona restaurant on the first night of our stay and it was nice although there were only two tables occupied so a little low in atmosphere we love this location as it is quiet but very easy to walk to piccadilly covent garden etc also easy to get cabs we went to a concert in brixton and got a cab there which was great the staff are very helpful we will definitely stay here again
