it was a charming hotel that felt like we were living in london not staying at some big hotel the location was convenient and not on a busy street i used to live a block away when i was in grad school and was very familiar with the area i have stayed at the four seasons dorchester and several other five star properties in london which are nice and have all the conveniences that the cranley doesn t have spa exercise facility restaurant etc but if you are looking for more of a boutique hotel you can t go wrong with the cranley we were there four nine nights with our two kids and and had two four poster bedrooms which we all loved even my kids said it was great
