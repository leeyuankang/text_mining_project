the classic room was a good size and comfortable all staff were extremely helpful they serve a good hot and cold buffet breakfast we ate in the kona restaurant which was a bit expensive but excellent food and we had a special offer of a bottle of free wine a good location for public transport and near many attractions good value compared to many more expensive london hotels we would strongly recommend this hotel and we look forward to returning
