nice rooms fantastic location and very helpful staff we had booked a couple of bus tours so we wanted to be close to victoria coach station this hotel was walking distance from the coach station and a couple of blocks from the tube and walking distance to so many attractions also i travelled with my yr old son so i wanted a safe place for a mom alone with her son we felt very safe in this hotel loved our stay here
