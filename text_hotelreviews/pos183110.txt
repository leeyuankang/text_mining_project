we enjoyed our stay and would consider staying there again it provided us with everything we expected and we were not disappointed with our choice to stay here we had an upgrade to a room with a king sized bed very nice room and finishes some of the things that stand out for us were providing us with a power converter when ours failed lovely bathroom although the door hits the toilet when you walk in the excellent sandwich shop across the street this little cafe served the best breakfast sandwich i have ever had did not eat at the buffet too expensive and preferred to get out to start touring immediately in the morning tube was not too far away easy to get around
