the staff were extremely helpful particularly the concierge staff we have stayed many times in london and further afield but this was one of the best hotels as far as staff interaction and attention was concerned the rooms were spotless well one has come to expect this but in this case it was exceptional the location was very convenient close to st james park underground station and buckingham palace the restaurants and shops of victoria street are within easy walking distance
