frankly apart from the location bank next to buckingham palace this property is far away from what a taj hotel is the upholstery carpets are too old torn at places the rooms are awfully small since it s a hospital turned to a hotel it is not an ideal hotel but to make matters worse the restaurant menu needs a lot to look into the breakfast was truly pathetic and minimal like in a typical bread and breakfast hotel spinach paratha everyday no curries only scrambled eggs and sour to too salty sausages we had a word with the restaurant management but still nothing really changed no idles no dosage nothing and to top it the staffwas too busy with pm visit moreover due to protests outside we were even not allowed inside by the police until someone from the staff ritesh intervened overall will not stay here again but for its great location hope mr rakesh sarna reads this
