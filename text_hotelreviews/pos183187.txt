booked a night break for us and our friends throughly enjoyed our stay my friends room was very large as was my sons ours was a lot smaller but very comfortable we had booked a royal afternoon tea for when we arrived the staff made us feel very welcome and the food especially the cakes was exactly what we expected from a hotel of this standard we visited a few london pubs on the first night there literally are a fair few of them around each corner probably due to the proximity of the barracks then ended up trying some of the special gins that the cocktail waiters recommended back at our home from home our breakfast on both mornings were fabulous with plenty of choice inc a taste of india this hotel is literally next door to buckingham palace the only thing we missed was having a swim after being tourists on the second day they have a sauna steam room but they are seperated into men ladies sides and my friend had a migraine on the saturday afternoon so while the chaps all had a nice steam room chat together i was on my own in the female facility the only minor negative
