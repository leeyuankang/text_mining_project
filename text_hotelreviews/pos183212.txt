we have visited taj st james a number of times now it is a truly excellent hotel certainly a jewel in london and i am surprised it is not as well known relative to other hotels there is nothing to fault here it has to be said everyone from the doormen conci rge reception room service housekeeping every single person really takes care of you without being intrusive we had a slight issue at check out but this was handled very well check in staff had made an error this is a very high quality stylish hotel and management should be proud they obviously get the little details right
