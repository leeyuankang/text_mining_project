this is a very lovely hotel old fashioned yet with modern amenities staff are fantastic and very helpful and certainly care about their guests room service very good with marvellous quality food the courtyard is a great hideaway to read or have coffee or a cigar free wifi which is fine but you have to pay for high speed if you want to watch netflix for example which is kind of an outdated concept these days there are some hidden charges nothing shocking but be mindful to check your bill before checking out as is usual with hotels they will say to book direct for the best rates but this is never true book via this site always overall a very good hotel great staff certainly should be in the top list of london hotels
