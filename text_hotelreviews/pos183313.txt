we were fortunate enough to obtain a great deal for a two night stay from the minute we arrived until the time we checked out we received great customer service from all the staff lovely comfortable quiet hotel just a few minutes walk from buckingham palace great facilities very comfortable bed and lovely bed linen and towels very good breakfast selection too would definitely recommend
