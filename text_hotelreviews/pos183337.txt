we very much enjoyed our stay the staff was friendly and the service provided was that of a star hotel the bathrooms are a little dated but the service and attentiveness of the staff and the overall approach of the hotel was fantastic and made this easy to overlook the lobby is very comfortable as well and we enjoyed unwinding there in the afternoon the touch of a live piano player was wonderful finally our year old daughter who lives in london decided to stay with us on the last night we were there and the staff quickly arranged for a cot in the room we look forward to staying at this hotel in the future
