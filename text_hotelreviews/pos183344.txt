beautiful hotel great service at the same time at an affordable price overall very very pleased with the stay and it is so close to buckingham palace less than mins i didn t even notice that when i booked the hotel three tube stations around the area although two requires a bit of walking but provides more remote choices if ever goes back we would love to stay at this same hotel again
