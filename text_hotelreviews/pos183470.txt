from client who stayed here september thank you for choosing this hotel such a wonderful and classy hotel situated in a very nice area close to buckingham palace yet very quiet my room was a corner room so definitely not small and very agreeable the breakfast is quite wonderful with all pastries fruits meat and you can order your egg the way you want it
