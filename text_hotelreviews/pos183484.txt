i ve stayed in many hotels both for leisure and work purposes this has been the nicest hotel by far every member of staff i crossed paths with came across very friendly and helpful i stayed in the junior exec suite it was lovely the breakfast was great too lovely food i am due to stay at the hotel again next week for the whole week and i hope the experience lives up to this one i m so fussy with hotels and the rooms so hoping the exec studio suite is just as nice next week
