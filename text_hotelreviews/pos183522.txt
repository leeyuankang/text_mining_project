i stayed at this hotel with my husband about months ago and hence when planning a trip with friends from america and we found a good price offer it was an obvious choice the hotel has an excellent location and was within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to visit literally minutes to buckingham palace staff exceptionally friendly and efficient the hotel has a nice calm atmosphere with nice rooms and comfortable beds perfect after a day of pounding the streets of london i would definitely recommend this hotel to family friends and more price offers would be a bonus our american friends were very impressed with the hotel
