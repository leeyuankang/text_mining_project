i like that the hotel was in an old building that had been fully renovated to a modern style we were unexpectedly upgraded to a suite that was more than roomy and was tastefully decorated i particulary liked the large tub with push button shower the location was very good walking distance to lots of attractions but on a quiet side street hotel employees were very friendly i would definitely stay here again
