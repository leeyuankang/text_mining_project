excellent location and easy to get to from the airport tram stops only a minute walk away and located minute walk away from the arc de triomphe and champs elysees very close to a little supermarket and nice bakeries as well as a couple of bars as a nice pit stop on the way back the room is lovely and the coffee is a nice little extra
