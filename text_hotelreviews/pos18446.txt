second stay at the nadler soho and still find it to be a fine hotel with excellent staff one of the best i ve met in london rooms are small simple yet fine and quiet bed comfortable shower is great and the small kitchen is a nice addition and usually i am not a fan of this feature you get a nearby gym pool access which are very nice all in all a hidden gem if you understand that it s the location and a very good night sleep that you are getting i intend to stay again
