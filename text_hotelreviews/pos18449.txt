i am a very demanding traveler with high standards despite the central location in soho the hotel was in a quiet street walking distance to selfridges piccadilly and oxford street i categorize this hotel as a boutique serviced residence i liked the clean modern and minimalist style of the hotel and the spacious room bed was super comfy and bathroom was modern clean and spacious too some coffee and tea was complementary though they could as a standard provide bottles of plain water i had to ask at the reception breakfast is available on demand they provide a menu from le pain au cotidien to choose from and deliver it to your room at the requested time worked like a charm and i love pain au cotidien this is a well deserved star hotel in my opinion stars can only be given to establishments like the four seasons shangri la le connaught where you are literally treated like royalty
