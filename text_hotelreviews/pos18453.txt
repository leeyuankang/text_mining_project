the nadler soho hotel is very well located in the heart of soho close to bars restaurants shops and all there is to do and see in london the staff is amazingly nice and helpful the rooms are very convenient not too big but very well adjusted to their size kitchen hidden in the closet for example the amenities are excellent i would highly recommend this hotel for a couple and or friends business trip it is a boutique hotel close to anything you may need in the heart of london
