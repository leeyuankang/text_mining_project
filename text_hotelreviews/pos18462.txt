the staff were exceptional we had quite stressful journey and booked the wrong dates too on top of that however the hotel staff went above and beyond they were so helpful professional and welcoming i would stay there again in a heartbeat also loved there is a microwave in the room with a tucked away kitchen unit so you could make your own meals which is great it was neat comfortable and exceeded our expectations
