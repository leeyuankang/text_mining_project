excellent location with easy walking to the champs elysees and the eiffel tower spoiled for choice with the restaurants and bars within a minute walk of the hotel very comfortable bed with the quietest most consistent air conditioning i have experienced normally i have to live without air con because it keeps the wife awake no such problem here rooms very clean and towels changed daily tea and coffee making facilities in room which is rare in some parts of france these days no pressure to use the hotel facilities
