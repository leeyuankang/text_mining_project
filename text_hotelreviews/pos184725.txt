first i was given a room with the view to the wall which made me clostrofobic but after me asking for another room everything was sorted out in no time and i received the upgrade to the best room in their sister hotel just a minute away with excellent view which i am very thankful to the receptionist lady at the sister hotel was extremely nice and helpful out of for her service
