the location was excellent for walking to all the sites and activities we wanted to do the staff was more than helpful and told us about the maximum on the taxi cost to the airport we were overcharged by and reported it to the hote when we returned to the usl the hotel got back to us immediately and said they would report it to the taxi company we appreciate that they took the time to address our concern even after we had left the country
