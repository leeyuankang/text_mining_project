the rooms were nice and spotless clean we had a view of avenue marceau not breathtaking but ample and pretty the staff were friendly we found macarons upon arrival we went to paris for a euro match so location wasn t our first concern even so the hotel is close enough to several metro lines there are many good bistros and brasseries nearby
