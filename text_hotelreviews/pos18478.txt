i loved the service at this boutique modern hotel the style and ambiance they create for their guests not only in the lobby but in the rooms are outstanding i stayed at this hotel for nights in march i even booked a day trip for a tour through the front desk team which i liked i enjoyed being treated well with a bottle of wine on ice in my room and the smart tv that was personalized with my name on it welcoming me to the hotel the interface of the smart tv was very easy to use and navigate through including a welcome letter for me on the screen explaining all about the property and wifi password they even had a handwritten card welcoming me to the hotel sitting at the desk in my room the bathroom had the amenities and extras i used and enjoyed throughout my stay the kitchenette was lovely i loved making a cup of nespresso every morning and because there was a tesco right next door i would often keep a few drinks or snacks in the fridge as well due to my long stay every morning i set out to leave the hotel or when i returned the staff would wish me a great day out and then welcome me back at night i slept like a baby in a very quiet room on the second floor even though the hotel is located in the middle of a very busy soho spot this is what i loved you could be out having fun at a pub one minute with hundreds of others making noises throughout the evening and next minute i would be in solitude in my room i have stayed at other star hotels and am surprised this place is only a star i have to say i enjoyed nadler soho more than the star i stayed at last time while in london which i won t mention here i definitely recommend this hotel to any young and old person who enjoys staying in the center of a bustling international city which is no more than to minute walk to mayfair oxford st shopping regent street trafalgar square stage shows british museum and so much more
