the staff were incredible really went out of their way to help me and my partner to establish the best poa in regards to maximising our time comfortable in paris the location is a min walk from the north of the champ elyees arc de triumph which meant travel on the metro was simple if not in walking distance we had the executive room which i believe is their most basic option the room was very clean came with a beautiful balcony area and the bed was the best night sleep i have had in years the restaurant looked fantastic although we did not eat here as we were so busy seeing the amazing sights that paris has to offer overall we were delighted with our stay and would highly recommend
