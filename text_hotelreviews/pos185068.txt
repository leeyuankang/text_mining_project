i have stayed in a number of tiny paris hotels over the years but i have to say this is one of my favorites the room was really well designed to make the best of the small space with lots of thoughtful touches like a cute rotary phone complimentary macarons plus the colorful decor was charming the staff of the hotel was very helpful and friendly and the free beverages and snacks in the kitchen available in the afternoon was a nice touch in the summer paris is super hot and sweaty and it was nice to know there was refreshment waiting for us
