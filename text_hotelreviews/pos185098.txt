hotel is situated in perfect place you can reach most of places of interest by foot and using rer from station luxembourg you can reach orly or cdg airports my room was small but decorated in beige tones what gives some light and brightness bed and shower were absolutely ok especially i like things how this hotel is styled alice in wonderland style and how nice are people working there i had pleasant stay and have no single complaint
