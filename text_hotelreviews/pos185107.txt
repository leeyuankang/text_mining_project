adorable for american expectations it is a small room but the space was used so well and beautiful proof bigger isn t always better there are larger rooms but it was just me and there was really no need the staff was so nice helping me understand how to get to versailles very easy to get to with a metro stop very near by and printing documents the location is about a min walk to notre dame and with shops and place to eat along the way as well as close to st germaine with more shopping and restaurants you might be nervous about not speaking french but everyone at the front desk spoke english i don t normally write review but it was so perfect i knew i was going to come home and write one did i mention it was adorable oh and i was slow to understand the theme le lapin blanc when i did i loved it even more
