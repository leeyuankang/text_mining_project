for the size of the room the price was a bit high but this area of london maybe not that much more it is an excellent location for theater and walkable dining options which was our focus for a short stay over for more than three or four days i d opt for a larger room though our room was very comfortable and very quiet i love that the kitchenette has a brita filter on the faucet room
