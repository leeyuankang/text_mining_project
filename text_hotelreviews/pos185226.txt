if you stay in london stay at hotel from the greeting of complimentary champagne to the honesty bar snack bar there is everything you could every want here the staff knew your name and engaged in all conversation at every opportunity we loved this hotel just wish it was a little cheaper and we could stay longer the bottles of water snacks and hot chocolate by the front door was a simple but excellent little touch
