the staff are so friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble they remember you by name which is a personal touch and one you do not get with a larger establishment the hotel itself is beautifully furnished with lots of extra features that make it memorable the pantry and ice cream that you can help yourself to and the honesty bar make a very homely and relaxed feel the breakfast was excellent and the bedrooms are beautifully decorated and spacious by london standards
