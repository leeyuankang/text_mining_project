staff was exceptionally accommodating the complimentary snacks in the afternoons and evenings are of excellent quality buffet breakfast fee was delicious and worth the expense the location was also very convenient to the underground victoria station blocks we happened to have stayed at the ritz hotel in london during our trip and think the overall facilities and services included at hotel make it the better choice
