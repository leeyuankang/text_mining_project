i planned a quick trip to london to celebrate my birthday and my daughter s golden birthday in order to make the trip seamless so that i could hit the ground running since it was such a short stay i contacted guest services a month in advance marlen was exemplar and superior she facilitated all of my theater plans tour plans and transport needs i valued her effort to assist with the planning of the trip just as much or even more than the stay upon arrival i had a fiftieth birthday cake and a personalized card when in a pinch lauren arranged for some of my shopping needs to be met while i was out on a tour lauren went the extra mile the wait staff was unusually kind and made us feel like guests in their homes
