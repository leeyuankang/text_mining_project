a wonderful boutique hotel in on the doorstep on buckingham palace the staff are friendly and interested and will do anything they can to assist you and make your stay more pleasant the all day buffet of sweets snacks and ice cream by day and hot and cold dishes by night is a delightful touch and the champagne trolley on check in is second to none the atmosphere is perfect relaxing quiet and comfortable and my family loved it i won t dream of staying anywhere else when i visit the capital from now on
