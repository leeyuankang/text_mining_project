this visit was to celebrate our wedding anniversary the staff laid out a rose petal love heart on our bed for the occasion the room was not as we booked and when we asked for one as per booking we were upgraded to a club room our bags were carried up for us as there are no lifts breakfast was great with a good choice of menu items and the staff in the restaurant were very polite and helpful
