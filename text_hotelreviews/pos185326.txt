great breakfast choice and glad it was included in the price otherwise it is quite expensive the staff were excellent throughout we had booked to stay in the shaftesbury suites but were upgraded to the sister marble arch hotel montcalm just up the road room was on the lower ground floor and was the quietest room we have ever stayed in in london would definitely consider staying again
