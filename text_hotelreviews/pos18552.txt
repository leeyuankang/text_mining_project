the location is very good close to all the nice restaurants in soho and fitzovia major underground stations such as oxford circus stn and tottenham court road stn major shopping streets such as regent st and oxford st soho is busy even until late at night so it is safe for travelers until late but hotel is slightly on the side street of the busy street so still is quiet in the rooms
