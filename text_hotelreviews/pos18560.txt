we like to walk and so we used the central soho location to see most of central london we walked round trip to and from the globe theatre tate modern national portrait gallery buckingham palace prince of wales theatre and the national history museum we felt safe doing these walks even late in the evening never used a taxi except for going to heathrow airport the staff aru helen liliana and the others were fantastic they greeted us every day on the way out and coming back in they helped us score great tickets to book of mormon provided a detailed map with perfect guidance and gave us the best restaurant recommendations of course got the bookings with very nice tables the neighborhood really vibrates with lots of folks spilling out of the bars after work and into the evening it was great to see the activity and camaraderie and lastly even with all the action outside our room was quiet for being right in the heart of soho and london proper we slept very easily comfortably and without noisy interruption the contemporary room was exceptionally clean and neat well laid out with a small kitchen inset including sink mini frig coffee expresso maker dishes glasses flatware and importantly a wine bottle opener the bathroom was totally functional with walk in shower and enough shelf space for lots of personal stuff not just one toothbrush there was a warming rake for towels and small laundry items overall it was a great time for us we were celebrating our wedding anniversary with a trip through sw england and our stay at the nadler was the best way to cap it off we will book the nadler again
