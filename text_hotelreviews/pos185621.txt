we had room which had a king size bed plus singles there were plenty of toiletries in the bathroom i believe the other double rooms are quite compact from what other guests were saying so if you can request this room then do so the building itself was beautiful and full of history the bar area in the hotel was nice and they were happy to make sandwiches etc for those who came back late from concerts nothing seemed too much trouble
