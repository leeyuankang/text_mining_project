we loved how convenient this location was because we were only in london for an overnight stay due to a layover and we were able to take the tube from the airport to the stop only blocks from the hotel and then we did our own walking tour of london ending up at a pub near the london eye then taking a taxi back which was only about a minute ride hours walking and were able to see many nearby sites such as hyde park harrods buckingham palace big ben westminster abbey london eye and many places in between the property is old the room was very small and their is no a c but it is historic and in the lovely neighborhood of kensington we felt safe and cozy and would definitely recommend this property again for short stays
