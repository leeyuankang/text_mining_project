not a pleasant experience i get fed up getting the worst rooms in hotels due to so called discounted rates i pad per night and was offered a dark basement room witch i refused due to it being extremely dull and depressing i was then offered a smaller floor room that i took but wasn t perticuly happy with still no window you could look out of unless you are tall noisey radiator that made a continueous noise from around it seemed difficult to get a normal sized room with a bath and a view on athe or floor i won t be going back
