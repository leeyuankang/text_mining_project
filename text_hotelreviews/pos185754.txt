the hotel was in a fantastic location very close to the museums but on a quiet road the staff were very friendly and made a real effort to make me and my young son feel welcome the rooms were very comfortable and well stocked with tea coffee and toiletries we will definitely be staying again and i would recommend this hotel to anyone
