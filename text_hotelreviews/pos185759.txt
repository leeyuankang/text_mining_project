the price for our rooms was very reasonable rooms were small but i have seen smaller very high ceilings and architectural details were a plus you could tell from the ceiling that the room was subdivided from a larger room the location was minutes walk to the gloucester square tube stop piccadilly district and circle lines and also close to south kensington and the v a natural history and science museums the hotel was clean safe and quiet
