the location was perfect for me since most of my london plans were already located in and around soho the food places around the nadler soho are wonderful and offer a huge variety mostly the staff was extremely helpful whenever i had any questions i was offered the option to upgrade my room upon arrival and i was more than happy to accept that offer the mini kitchen is very useful and though the room was quite small the arrangement of everything made for a perfect use of space the bed was very comfortable and made for very good rest
