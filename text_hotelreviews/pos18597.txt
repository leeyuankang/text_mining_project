the location is great right in the thick of it really convenient with lots of dining options a few steps away but it s still remarkably peaceful when you re in your room the staff are exceptional and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you make the most of your stay immaculately clean rooms well designed great little kitchenette reliable free wifi take note hotels of london which charge way more than the nadler and still try to fleece guests by charging for wifi
