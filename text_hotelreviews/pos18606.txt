beautiful staff from all over the world great little ish hotel rooms look small and was the smallest room we stayed in for our whole trip yet it was spacious enough to do what we needed and the area is full of bars comedy clubs and right near all the playhouses so you wont spend much time in there anyway very clean and comfortable i stayed in a small double and as mentioned it is fine to stay in you do have to climb over your partner to get out of bed if you are against the window but all in all that is not such a bad thing
