this hotel fitted very well with our needs it is well positioned close to montparnasse it is modern and clean hotel very good wifi beds are big and comfortable the room was very quiet staff very friendly and helpful the street in front is relatively quiet and so not much traffic or pedestrian noise the whole hotel is non smoking which suited us perfectly breakfast was perfect for our needs we included breakfast in our room rate so i can t advise value for money on breakfast the underground station of liege is only about metres walk away and is only stops from the champs elysees two tips a you can leave your luggage at reception on your last day and they allowed us to use the shower in the gym in the afternoon when we came back to get our suitcases which was great because there was a heatwave on our last day b the hotel can arrange a shuttle to take you to the airport this is reasonably priced and much easier than using underground trains this is not a hotel which has a lot of facilities like a restaurant or outside patio but that is not what we wanted anyway its ideal for a paris traveller who needs a very good place to stay as a base they serve snacks in the afternoon until evening
