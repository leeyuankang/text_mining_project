the bed was really quite comfortable and the rain shower added a touch more luxury we loved the faux fireplace and the tv in the mirror which is a fairly small typically capital city sized room is a great use of space we had a courtyard room with big opening windows which was nice the biggest thing for us was how quiet everything was which allowed for a good night s sleep easy access to several metro lines within a minutes walk which made adventuring around the city very easy
