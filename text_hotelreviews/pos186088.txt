a stylish hotel with well equipped rooms including a large and very comfortable bed lovely and very helpful staff a couple of good bus options nearby and also reasonably close to two metro stations a great patisserie across the road for those seeking a less calorific and cheaper alternative to the hotel s buffet breakfast
