great staff and location right by the pantheon it is a to minute walk to two hip restaurant bar streets muffetard and st michel streets and different metro stations within a minute walk to notre dame and the louvre the central air worked great in the degree heat and was a very quiet system the free handy smart phone for use was an unexpected bonus
