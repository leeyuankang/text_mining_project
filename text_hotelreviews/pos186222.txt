the hotel was on the prime location the proximity of maubert metro station pantheon a grocery store which is open until midnight latin quarter good restaurants adjacent to the building made the stay convenient and memorable i was a solo female traveler first time in paris the staffs were friendly they had staff at the reception the room was clean the only disadvantage was the size of the room it was too small to move around but considering all the other factors i would ignore that since i was away the whole day
