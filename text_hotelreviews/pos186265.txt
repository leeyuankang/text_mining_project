reception staff was great rooms are nice a lot of storage space and they were cleaned everyday bathroom and shower was really nice first we were put in a room facing the courtyard it was pretty big but also dark thankfully they were able to change it so my suggestion is asking for a room facing the street noise didn t bother us windows cut it pretty well wi fi was good we were in a corner room so it was not the best one to receive signals but we were able to use it without much problems i was with my mother and we both loved the location and the hotel it was overall a good experience
