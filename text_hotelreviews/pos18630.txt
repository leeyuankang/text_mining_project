very friendly and courteous staff at the desk who were able to assist with all my enquiries i liked the flexibility of being able to use the kitchen facility in the room thereby cutting out the necessity for expensive room service often found in other hotels fantastic central location with so many restaurants and cafes around for supper and breakfast too
