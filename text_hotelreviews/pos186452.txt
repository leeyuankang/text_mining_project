cute hotel in a very convenient location close to montmartre but not in a noisy environment the hotel is very nicely renovated and unlike in many other renovated buildings which often are noisy my room was incredibly quiet and this despite being right next to the elevator i have seldomly experienced such good soundproofing in hotel room doors other than this the rooms are well decorated and the bathroom was brilliant please keep in mind that hotel rooms in central paris tend to be on the small side this also applies to this facility
