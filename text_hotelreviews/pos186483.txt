the hotel is located on a quiet street near the moulin rouge if you re not paying attention you might miss it the reception area although small is lovely we arrived around and were informed we d been upgraded from a triple room into a double and twin free of charge which was lovely for my mum as it was her first time in paris and she didn t have to share a small room the double was massive only let down was some damage to the bathroom wall under the sink the beds were insanely comfortable the ac perfect there was a safe in both rooms tv lovely mirrors and a nice shower our twin was small but we loved it didn t need anything bigger but we re somethings and it was a short stay if you re planning to spend a lot of time in the room or bringing a lot of luggage a bigger toom is probably necessary the hotel was wonderful and i would definitely stay here again
