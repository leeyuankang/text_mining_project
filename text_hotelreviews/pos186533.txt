good spacious room good tea and coffee facilities and complimentary water small touch but important many more expensive hotels have started charging for the bottled water in the room which i think is outrageous there was a sign offering complimentary toiletries if forgotten in addition to usual shower stuff etc which i thought was a nice touch i didn t need this but it was a good offer
