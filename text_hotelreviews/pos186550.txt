i know the area well from when i lived nearby and although it has become more trendy since then frankly it s still pretty rough and run down it s a short walk from cambridge heath overground which is limited in usefulness and a longer walk to bethnal green tube station and unfortunately although the buses are useful and nearby and they get crowded in rush hour and sometimes don t even stop to pick you up nonetheless the good value and nice rooms make up for this and i will be staying again
