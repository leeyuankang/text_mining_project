very good value in comparison to other local hotels especially during what was a busy may day bank holiday weekend located on hackney road with good local facilities including a tesco express which was directly opposite near enough as well as many other local and late night off licences and independent shops for those travelling into shoreditch for a night out there are many local taxi firms as well as a very short waiting time for ubers which are readily available swiftly upon arrival the hotel reception area is quite impressive for what is a lower end in terms of price hotel in the shoreditch district there is a bar area with plenty of seating and also shows sports with a good choice of drinks and food on offer we were greeted quickly by a friendly receptionist who handled the process swiftly and professionally whilst still friendly and easy going our floor room was surprisingly spacious for a standard size and was as you d expect clean another impressive thing was for me unlike many other lower priced rooms it certainly was light and airy and did not feel like a prison or cage as you could open the large window with obvious safety restrictions but with the black out curtains you still could shut out from the outside world and retain your privacy there was good storage space a mini fridge and complimentary water which included sparkling for those who like it and the bathroom was a nice size and well finished
