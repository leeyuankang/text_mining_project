the location is a minute bus ride away from the local tube stops or you can walk it in about mins so you get to explore the area the bed was ridiculously comfortable the complimentary tea coffee biscuits and hot chocolate was a nice touch i wasn t woken once from the noise outside in fact it was completely silent all week wifi was decent managed to watch a few programmes with no issues staff were polite and friendly
