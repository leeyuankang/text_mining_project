i liked the fact that the staff was pleasant for the most part the room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom the pillows were also really comfortable and there was air conditioner available in our room which was great since it got a little hot sometimes the hotel is also in a good location there s plenty of cafes and restaurant and bars around the area good for nightlife if you take the underground it s like minutes to the center of london
