the hotel is solidly built and at the back away from the main road is very quiet it is also quiet internally very little sound penetrates from above or from either side and the bedroom doors are too heavy to slam an idea that other hotels might copy rooms are large comfortable and very clean with good adjustable ventilation and heating the staff are very helpful and pleasant apart from the manager bathrooms are excellent the location is excellent for the city and for london fields
