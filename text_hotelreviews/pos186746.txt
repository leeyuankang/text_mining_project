hotel facilities and location perfect for central london don t be put off by its close proximity to hackney the area felt safe and people were generally friendly some really good local traditional pubs nearby hotel was excellent reception staff very efficient and friendly rooms spotlessly clean loved the thoughtful little touches excellent quality biscuits and daily bottles of water in room fridge everything that you would need including full size ironing board thankful for the air conditioning and dark curtains very quiet considering near main road safe onsite parking for our car could not fault this hotel
