i have stayed here a few times now and have to say it is a real find rooms are good size with amenities that other higher priced hotels often lack a working fridge working air conditioning and free consistent wifi moreover the beds are super comfortable the staff are all friendly and efficient and it has a decent restaurant and a proper bar i d happily recommend the re to anyone looking for quality and comfort at a more than reasonable price
