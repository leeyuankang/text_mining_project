some of your staff are excellent carlos at the bar kitchen was outstanding and your bar man who owns a few dogs was a great bar man very funny but some of your desk staff where rude your manager never introduced himself to us either which would have been a nice touch you have a policy of asking for payment for goods as soon as you order them its very annoying i only ordered tea and coffee i am not going anywhere i would have paid the for my drink we were asked to leave our room twice after agreeing the first time we would depart at we got a physical knock at the door by a manager it did n t bother me but me it really annoyed my better half
