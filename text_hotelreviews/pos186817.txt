i regularly use the re shoreditch for overnight stays when i have an evening function and have to go to work in the city the next day the rooms are quiet clean and comfortable and the bathroom facilities are excellent the only slight drawback is that the nearest tube station is minutes away but weather permitting i just walk to the city it s not too far
