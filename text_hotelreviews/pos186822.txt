although i have rated the location less than excellent this needs some clarification i don t like the idea of walking down hackney road at night however on a road adjacent to the hotel and a relatively short distance there is a terrific eating area all along the road is well lit and the italian restaurant in particular is excellent the room is generous in size the bathroom very good and overall a great find for us
