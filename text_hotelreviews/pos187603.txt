the hotel is located relatively close to the tube station moorgate easy to reach by walking we got an upgrade and therefore stayed in a really nice room the employees were very helpul and friendly there is a waggon with hot coffee and the in the lobby where guests can help themselves with a beverage there is also some fruit and some magazines in the room very nice details that made the hotel a little bit better than the normal hotel in london the best thing for us was that you can really sleep in without being disturbed by the cleaners also the check out time is rather late noon which we really liked still when we arrived early on our first day they already had a room ready for us eventhough we were about two hours too early to check in time
