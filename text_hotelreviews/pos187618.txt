i can be very harsh with my reviews but i am always truthful and this hotel is a real beauty gorgeous rooms its only mins from nearest tube stop they literally cover everything to the finest detail the bathroom sink and bath and mugs and saucers for tea making are all villeroy boch the biscuits are gorgeous upon arrival basket of fruit and water the mini bar has a great slippers and bathrobes even nice bags to put any shopping in literally everything you need and the shower products are elemis it is all state of the art technology the staff can be a little too over helpful yes i shouldn t complain but it can be a little annoying but apart from that i can honestly say i will return over and over well done breakfast is steep at per person but great though
