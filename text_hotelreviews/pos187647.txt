the croissants were flaky and lush good breakfast selection overall the staff were very very welcoming and nice it was my partner birthday weekend and they offered him additional perks and made him feel very welcome he had a lovely time and we have already recommended to our friends and family definitely a place to go for a romantic weekend with a loved one xx
