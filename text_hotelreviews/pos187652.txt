the beds are really comfy and a dream to sleep on the staff are all really friendly and make you feel welcome as soon as you step in the door the location is amazing minutes away from a tube on the northen line and stops away from charing cross some lovely cafes just down the road from the hotel which are slightly cheaper than the food in the hotel
