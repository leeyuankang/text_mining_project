the london city suites are very clean and comfortable rooms at a great value our own room was a great size and a very comfortable bed and a tv with sky channels including sky sports tea facilities provided ample amount of drinks and food selection and i thought the electric blind between the bath and living space was a fancy touch the hotel is minutes from barbican station ideal to get anywhere on the underground
