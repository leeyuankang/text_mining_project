just love the way that the staff are so helpful and make you feel comfortable we are not exactly rich people but work really hard for our money but feel when we come there we are treated as equals and sometimes when we travel to lovely hotels we don t feel comfortable like when we stay st the montcalm looking forward to our next stay
