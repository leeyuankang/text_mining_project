the hotel is beautiful and our room was great a good size and very comfy bed with a great shower the staff were friendly and polite and couldn t have been more helpful we arrived very early and they took care of our bags which were waiting for us in our room when we got back to the hotel a great location for the tube both barbican and moorgate are less than a min walk from the hotel overall it was a joy to stay here and i will most definitely be returning
