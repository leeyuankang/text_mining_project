this hotel really does feel like a touch of luxury the staff are very courteous and helpful the rooms are nicely done and everything you could need is provided we didn t have any food as the breakfast finishes quite early but cote across the road does a nice breakfast until the hotel is very conveniently located near barbican and moorgate if you book in advance the prices are very reasonable for the standard of accommodation in central london
