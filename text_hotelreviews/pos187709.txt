the team running this hotel is superb this was my second trip to this hotel in two weeks both times i was upgraded on check in victoria was super kind in giving me my room well before the check in time because she knew i would be tired travelling from canada overnight all the staff were extremely helpful in trying to make sure i had everything i might need the hotel is a short walk minutes to the theatre district and has a tube station and bus stop close by for those who don t want to walk while some people claim that the breakfast is a bit pricey there are lots of cheaper options close by
