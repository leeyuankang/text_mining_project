the hotel is convenient to liverpool street station is beautifully decorated very clean with comfortable beds and friendly staff there was complimentary tea coffee shortbread as well as iced water and fruit that you can enjoy whilst sitting in the lobby as the air conditioning wasn t working in our original room and it was very warm we were upgraded to a montcalm club room this room type was more spacious and a little more luxurious than the standard room as you would expect and i would book this the next time the staff were very helpful quick to deal with any issues and did all they could to ensure that we had a pleasant stay
