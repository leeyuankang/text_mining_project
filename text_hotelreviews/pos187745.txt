wonderful experience very luxurious excellent staff superb room excellent housekeeping a couple of small problems eg safe did not lock at first were dealt with immediately location is good close enough to everything yet away from the craziness of central london loved it and will definitely return whenever we are in london and will enthusiastically recommend to friends
