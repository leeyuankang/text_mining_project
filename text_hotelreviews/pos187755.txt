friendly and helpful staff very well equipped nicely furnished rooms with lots of extras unfortunately the air conditioning in our room failed to work on our first evening they were unable to fix this however we were quickly moved to another room which was in fact a better room than the original the hotel is very handy for the barbican tube stop and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel equally if you enjoy exploring london by foot you can easily walk to many attractions we found this three night break to be of exceptionally good value for this standard of hotel in london
