when checking in at london city suites at least early in the morning you actually check in at the desk at the montcalm at the brewery london city which is located across the street my daughter and i and her broken ankle arrived very early in the morning and asked to leave our bags until later in the day after we had done some sightseeing when we returned the bellhop escorted us to an upgraded club room at the montcalm at the brewery which was handicapped accessible so i haven t actually stayed at london city suites i have stayed at the montcalm at the brewery the whole point of this is the staff noticed our need for an accessible room and they made it happen even if we didn t actually have reservations at the montcalm and even if we didn t ask for an upgrade it was a wonderful surprise the room came with a free cell phone with free international calling and internet access and maps we were allowed to take out of the room with us as we explored the city there were current issues of magazines a small fruit bowl an umbrella robes and house shoes
