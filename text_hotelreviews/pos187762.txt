the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived the room was comfortable and very well appointed fantastic bed the jugged hare on the corner was great and the beer garden opposite complete with leather chesterfields was ideal on a warm summers evening the barbican is just across the road and well worth a trip to see an exhibition or just for a coffee by the fountains the whole area was much more local than touristy which helped add to our relaxed weekend i would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a london break with a bit of a difference
