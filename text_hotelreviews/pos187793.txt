we got a free upgrade on arrival although i think the only difference was it was slightly bigger and had a different name but nice to be given either way the staff were extremly attentive and very friendly amazing customer service there are many business that could learn from the staff here great service in looking after our bags on the last day hotel is a bit of a maze in finding your way round but all part of the fun lovely room and exceptionally clean loved the shower we had a fantastic time thank you so much
