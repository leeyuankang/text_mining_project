the hotel allowed us to check in before time more than the usual couple of hours which we really appreciated seen we had just arrived from a night flight room was nice and spacious with good black out curtains location was perfect for us as the barbican centre is just accross the street and the tube station is close by staff at check in was really friendly and attentive
