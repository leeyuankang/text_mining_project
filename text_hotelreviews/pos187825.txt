what a great location the room was spacious and clean it smelt clean the white linen looked crisp and inviting the bed was a fantastic size and very comfortable the decor was muted and relaxing with ambient adjustable lighting the bathroom was modern tiled again clean and very well appointed a lovely feature was a choice of waterfall shower power shower and a bath i really felt welcomed by the added touch of rose petals balloons complimentary wine and cake also the hand written note was a lovely gesture
