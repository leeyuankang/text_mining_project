the staff were very friendly and helpful reception was very welcoming the room was small but very nice and comfortable it was a single it was a lovely old building that used to be a brewery an easy walk to st paul s cathedral i even thought about going to the morning service there before breakfast the price at for a single room was i realise good for london sunday night and not a lot of places offer single rooms it was certainly a good place but not sure i would rush to stay there again but it was fine generally
