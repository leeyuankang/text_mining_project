i arrived at the hotel honestly expecting a kind of self catering room like you d find at a marriott or similar and found to my absolute delight the most sumptuous room i ve stayed in in years the staff particularly gabrielle were incredibly welcoming without being intrusive and couldn t have been more helpful absolutely stellar service we also had dinner in the pub restaurant that night and it was to die for in all one of the best experiences i have ever had this will be my go to in london for business and or pleasure in the future perfect in every way
