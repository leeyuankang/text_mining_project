after a very warm welcome we were shown to our suite room this was most tastefully decorated without any naff art on the walls and thankfully without the unnecessary range of useless extra small cushions propped up against the two main night pillows the bathroom was a good surprise being as spacious as the bedroom itself with villeroy and boch fittings the bed was extremely comfortable with good quality pillows at all times the staff were most courteous and helpful and we spoke several times with a delightful romanian doorman who originally showed us to our room most conveniently positioned near to the barbican and liverpool street stations in a most interesting building because we were eating out with a previous family arrangement for a special birthday celebration we didn t experience the food on this first occasion all together this was a most comfortable and enjoyable experience highly recommended t c e from suffolk
