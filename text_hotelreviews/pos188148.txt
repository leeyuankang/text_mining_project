they upgraded our room when we arrived since it was very hot in paris at the time we ended up in a beautiful spacious airconditioned room the staff were all very helpful and friendly the location is perfect for exploring paris on foot or by public transport the louvre is literally around the corner but when you are in the room it is quiet and comfortable don t miss the wine bars and restaurants in the little side street one block away
