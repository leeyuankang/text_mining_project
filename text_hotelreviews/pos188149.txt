the hotel is centrally located but on a quiet street with pleasant cafes steps away the staff was knowledgable pleasant cheerful and accommodating the property was pristinely kept the cushioned bay window seat in the room and the elevator were both enjoyed appreciated by my mother the linens were crisp fresh and sumptuous the train station to the airport is a short walk away excellent choice for travelers on the go
