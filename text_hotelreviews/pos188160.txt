we booked the studio attrape r ve it was more than what a hotel could provide even it s not located in the hotel but it is really cozy and comfortable for a couple like us really good location and tbh it s like a home for us in paris we decided to book for one more night but unfortunately the apartment had been booked so we had to move to junior suite sans mod ration in hotel crayon rouge it has really modern design with lots of space in the room it has a huge bath tube also with massage function lucky for the girls the room also has a make up desk in general this hotel apartment is really good for couples young people to come and enjoy the best experience in paris
