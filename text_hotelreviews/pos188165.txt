the location of this hotel is ideal the spaces from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms have a hip well curated vibe the walls are pretty sound proof even though i was located right near the elevator i didn t hear other guest very much ever so slightly if someone was talking loudly as they got on off the elevator but not a peep from within the rooms the bed was very comfortable and i slept well the room is small but it s paris so i expect small a tiny little gem of a hotel
