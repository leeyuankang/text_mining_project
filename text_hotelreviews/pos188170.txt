we stayed in the studio attrape reve and given that it is in a residential apartment building we really felt we got the local experience it was a fantastic combination of the support of a hotel with the independence and local experience of a rented apartment grabbing some local produce and fresh bread for breakfast was a great way to start the day it helped to have the kitchen amenities of the studio so we could refrigerate things and make eggs for breakfast etc the studio itself was small like all things in paris but it was beautiful and exactly like the pictures the location was fantastic and we spent so much of our time in paris walking service was excellent and staff very helpful
