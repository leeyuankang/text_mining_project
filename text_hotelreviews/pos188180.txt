the hotel is in a great location for the sites and there are many small bars and restaurants in the immediate area the breakfast is a buffet served at a big table which was really friendly and was great to have a chat over breakfast with the other guests the room was spacious and comfortable and the staff were so helpful and friendly would definitely recommend and we will go back on our next trip to paris
