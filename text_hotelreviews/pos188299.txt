the hotel was fine but grossly overpriced due to the adele concert and it was non refundable i have never spent so much on a hotel before and at nearly each for the night it was extortionate the staff on the reception desk were exceptionally kind as i was really upset it was not a per night room i would not have been there if it wasn t for the concert which was cancelled
