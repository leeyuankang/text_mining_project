we only had a one night stay at st george s for a concert at wembley stadium which is literally on the doorstep i m only sorry that we didn t get to stay longer the room was fantastic clean spacious and comfortable we ate in the la regina restaurant for our evening meal and breakfast both meals were delicious staff were friendly and helpful we would highly recommend this hotel and would most definitely stay again if we are ever in the area
