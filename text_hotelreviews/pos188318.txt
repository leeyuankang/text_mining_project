our room was lovely until the toilet broke it constantly flushed itself we reported the problem to staff who basically told us there was nothing they could do once we d fallen asleep a board containing electricals dropped causing a loud bang exposing plugs belonging to the tv hairdryer etc which in turn woke us up and to top it off the milk for the complimentary coffee tea was rotten we eventually managed to change rooms we had no problems as all in the second room
