clean comfortable beds no noise from outside but unfortunately a herd of elephants in the room above around plenty of choice on the continental breakfast buffet and the staff all very helpful and friendly i thought the car park charge was a bit much for a piece of spare space at the back but it was well secured close to wembley arena which was the reason for our visit however the disabled wet room had a couple of minuses the shower floor should have had a rougher surface and i nearly slipped shower controls needed indication of what each was for as i got the full force on my head at one point and that was freezing could have supplied a shower cap disabled toilet pedestals are normally higher than provided there was no holder for toilet roll
