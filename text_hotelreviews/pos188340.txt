lovely clean modern hotel with onsite parking charged at per day and restaurant restaurant menu is reasonably priced food is perfectly acceptable but nothing to rave about friendly staff i ordered eggs benedict for breakfast priced at on the menu but for some reason i was charged price for full english and continental breakfast i couldn t eat the breakfast anyway as the poached eggs were hard the hollandaise sauce was more like cheese sauce it came with parma ham which was fatty and stringy and was served like a sandwich with half a muffin on bottom and half on top so i was charged more than double for something i didn t eat waiter disappeared after bringing my breakfast so couldn t complain
