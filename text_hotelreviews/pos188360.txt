the tv in the bath tub was a nice touch the the already amazing bathroom beds are really comfortable the tv is a generous size and connectivity to it is nice and easy along with other connection options like bluetooth and headphone jack are a good touch the location is great if you plan on going to a game at wembley of just fancy a shopping trip with the outlet mall near by but parking is limited and it s a first come first served basis as they have limited spaces at a fair charge we all enjoyed out time at this prestigious hotel without being over priced and the staff are very friendly
