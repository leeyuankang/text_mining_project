fantastic location for wembley stadium and arena clean modern facilities and wonderfully helpful friendly staff who arranged food delivery to our room when the concert we attended ended much later than intended we had the most fantastic weekend though loved the lighting system in the room with dimmer switches and all manner of buttons
