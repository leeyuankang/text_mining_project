very pleasant and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble the whole hotel was spotlessly clean and inviting and the bed was so comfy the restaurant was great and the food was reasonably priced and delicious too really enjoyed watching tv whilst relaxing in the bath very indulgent the bus stopped right outside the hotel and the tube was a min stroll away we would be extremely happy to return to this hotel and to recommend it to friends family and you too
