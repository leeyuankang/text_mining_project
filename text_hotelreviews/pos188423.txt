we stayed at the hotel for nights from the moment we arrived anna the receptionist was brilliant we were upgraded to a superior room check in was very efficient we needed parking for an extra day as we wanted to go sightseeing anna sorted this out when we checked in anna made me feel looked after and as a first point of contact was an excellent representation for the hotel i would definitely stay here again room was spacious and clean the tv in the bathroom was so good to relax we had a cooked breakfast which was really nice
