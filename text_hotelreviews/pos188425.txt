we visited last year and enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to book the hotel again this year for our pre christmas visit the staff were very helpful and even changed one of our rooms so we all had a bath with the tv in the bath we did not have breakfast at the hotel as we found that a bit too pricey but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the designer outlet across the road
