sometimes you go to a restaurant or hotel and the team working their just make it look easy from the welcome at reception and the efficient service in the restaurant to meeting the chambermaid when i was leaving everyone looked engaged knowledgeable about their product and as though they wanted to be there this is my favourite type of place as i can tell that the team are well lead be at decent gm and company finally when i checked out the reception team were genuinely interested in my experience during my stay the room was spotless the av equipment all worked and the tv in the bath was a nice touch my experience in the restaurant was limited to a couple of house reds very well chosen as a house wine and reasonably priced nice glassware the food that i had was simply and squid side as i had eaten earlier on but it was well presented and cooked perfectly i will stay again
