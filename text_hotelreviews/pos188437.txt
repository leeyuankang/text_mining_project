what did we like let s start with the proximity to the metro station from there it was a very pleasant minute walk to the hotel we arrived much earlier than check in time however they checked to determine if a room was available there was our room provided an excellent view of wembley stadium and of the street below the colors used in decorating the room the layout of the room and the amenities were all upscale everything in the room was an experience the touch light dimmers and air conditioning heat the heated bathroom floors the rain shower the recessed tv in the tub the thick padding underneath the carpet and less i forget my first traditional english breakfast at the restaurant on site was delicious finally the staff was engaging helpful informing and humorous my apologies in failing to get your names
