great location for wembley stadium and arena just a few mins walk and also right near to wembley central train station and wembley park shopping outlet with lots of choice of restaurants and shops the staff are very polite and friendly and helpful with directions and travel information they provided an ice bucket and bottle opener on request the rooms are luxurious and spacious great value for money with lighting and temperature controls on both sides of the huge double bed the bathroom has a tv and optional dimmed lighting which was very relaxing in the bath there s a fridge in the room which was handy and the tele had a good selection of channels so we were never bored you can also just see the stadium out of the window too i ve stayed here twice now and will certainly be staying again in the future highly recommended
