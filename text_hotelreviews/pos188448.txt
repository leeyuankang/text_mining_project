the room was a ten clean and nice what i am use to for an american hotel the location is far away from the city center i e costing more to use the metro to get around also about a minute walk from the main station to the hotel if you plan on going to a game at the wembley stadium and that is the main part of your trip then it is a great location this hotel is right across the street but there is no crosswalk close by so get ready to play life size frogger
