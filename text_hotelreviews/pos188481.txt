our bed was so comfortable i even got to watch tv in the bath the room was cleaned every day i asked for ironing facilities after being in room for only five minutes and we got them within less than a minute and got told to just keep a hold of them for our stay great thank you we had breakfast included and it started us off every morning lovely english breakfast cooked very well the staff in hotel were polite and very friendly we wanted to do some obvious sightseeing and found the tube and bus use very easy the number bus stops right outside the hotel and drops you off at wembley park tube where you can get a tube to anywhere for little money and not a lot of time make sure you buy an oyster card not the visitor one we got ours in kings cross they cost each we put each onto our cards and travelled for basically days we got unused money back as well as the for the card the public transport is easy and if your unsure just ask staff in the station
