the rooms were excellent with large comfy beds fab air con and huge tv the bathrooms are also superb probably the best bathroom i have found in a hotel they even have a tv at the end of the bath there are a few negatives below but this hotel has one of the nicest rooms we have ever stopped in and will definitely use again i would just advise that you go to one of the local eateries for breakfast
