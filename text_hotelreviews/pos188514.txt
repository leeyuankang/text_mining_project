upgraded to superior deluxe room hotel interiors and room had a very luxurious feel other positives very competitively priced for location reasonably priced parking space good location in room air conditioner with fan and temperature controls large and comfy bed funky in room touch control panel for lights which could be dimmed to romantic mood lighting levels overall a very pleasant experience for a one night stay some minor deficiencies certainly need improving but meanwhile would highly recommend
