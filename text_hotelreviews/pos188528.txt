car park entrance is on the street to the right of the hotel but can only be reached via the one way system to the left of the hotel the reception is not signposted at the door from the car park go down the stairs rather than up twin room was very clean and modern and digital lighting is a nice touch lets you select from brightness settings and does the rest for you reception staff were friendly and helpful didn t try the breakfast but at for cooked to order it sounds like very good value for london
