found the nearest available hotel i could after a booking mishap was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the establishment it is a fantastic hotel by all counts but it was the little things that really stood out touch screen controls for housekeeping privacy directly next to your bed which also includes controls for all the lights which were conveniently all dimmer switches and a very clean modern interface for heat control additionally the room had a wonderful control console for the television which also featured an incredibly convenient european not uk plug without that i would not have been able to charge my phone as i had forgotten my eu to uk converter though that s not entirely correct as there are usb ports scattered around the room with even an hdmi connector for the tv bathroom was also very clean and modern but nothing to write home about the staff were also incredibly helpful and friendly all in all i can safely say that this was one of the nicest hotels i ve ever had the pleasure of staying in and will prefer it if i ever find myself in the uk again
