lovely hotel very spacious stylish and clean not cluttered with signs and notices everywhere like some hotels staff were very friendly we checked in early and left our bags while we went to a gig we returned after to collect our bags to be told our bags had already been taken to our room which was great customer service extra points the air conditioning was good and the tv was huge and there was a tv in the bathroom shower great there was also a separate hand held shower nice balcony view of the wembley stadium arch location is fab for the stadium and the hotel is minute from wembley stadium train station
