reception staff were welcoming friendly and were quick to solve our problem re lack of toilet rolls in bathroom having stayed at other wembley hotels when attending previous events we have had to que for breakfast and the restaurants were understaffed for the number of guests at this hotel breakfast was a more pleasant experience with clean tables and a friendly waitress the air conditioning in our room worked well as it was a hot night good position for wembley stadium with a quiet atmosphere
