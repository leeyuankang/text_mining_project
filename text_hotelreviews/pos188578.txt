the room was spacious and the king size bed was a bonus the shower was excellent as was the large tv the downside to the room was that the underfloor heating in the bathroom wasn t working and there was only one chair there is room for two the location of the hotel is excellent for wembley stadium and wembley arena but a little out of the way for london the underground is about a minute brisk walk or minutes leisurely walk
