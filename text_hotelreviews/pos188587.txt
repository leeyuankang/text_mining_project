this was a comfortable hotel and convenient for the wembley area the price seemed reasonable as it included breakfast however the sting in the tale was that the breakfast included was for the continental a surcharge had to be paid for a cooked breakfast the continental breakfast was poor but the cooked extra cost was good i would stay again but i think there is better value in the wembley area
