the hotel was easy to find and in great location even though it was on a busy road the traffic could hardly be heard in the room the room was big and the bed was so comfortable too the tv screen in the bathroom was a pleasant surprise too breakfast was lovely we upgraded to full english the meal in the evening was lovely too
