first impressions of hotel were good staff were friendly and welcoming hotel presentation was clean and airey room was clean and spacious with a balcony bed was comfortable and bedding lovely and clean we ate in the restarant downstairs and the food was nice and reasonably priced hotel is in great position for both arena and stadium but far enough away so you do not have to put up with the noise from the shops and earteries which are also close by we really enjoyed our stay
