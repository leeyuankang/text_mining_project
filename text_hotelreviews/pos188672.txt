we had an absolutely fantastic stay at the hotel brilliant value for money its not close to london central about on the tube there is a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent buses and just a short walk to the tube station its across from london designer outlet which has plenty a bargin and good selection of resturants staff were very helpful and welcoming the hotel itself has to be one of the cleanest hotels i have stayed in and that s saying a lot as i am really fussy breakfast was lovely and plentyful had an evening meal one of the days which was also lovely we have already booked to go back
