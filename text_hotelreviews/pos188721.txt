we liked everything about this hotel all of the staff were very helpful and all had a smile all of the time nothing was too much trouble for them we had evening dinner in the la regina restaurant and lunch the next day as we thought it was so good the food was excellent and the service star the room was immaculate can honestly say that there was absolutely nothing we could complain about would definitely go back there again
