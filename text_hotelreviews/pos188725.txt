room was of outstanding quality and comfort even though the hotel is new and has only been open a few weeks according to the lady receptionist parking is secure but very limited and on a first come first gets basis so glad i reserved a space when booking and only gbp per night the italian style meals are very tasty as was breakfast in my opinion i consider it excellent value for money and worthy of a higher rating just as long as they don t increase their prices
