room was very modern and had all the high tech spec you needed to make this a great business and leisure venue you couldn t hear other people s tv or voices in the room so good sound proofing the staff in the bar were very pleasant and helpful and had a really good rapport with guests i d definitely recommend this hotel but change your eastern european receptionist she let s you down
