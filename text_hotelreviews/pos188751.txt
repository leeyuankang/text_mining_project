this hotel is excellent having booked a mid range room at a discounted rate we were advised on arrived that we have been upgraded free if charge to an executive room which was fabulous this is the first time i have come across a room with a tv in the bath complete luxury for less than per night the staff at the st george could not do enough to make us welcome and the continental breakfast included was plentiful and delicious thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone attending events at wembley stadium or wembley arena staying here is a great way to round off a trip to wembley thank you so much to everyone at the st george we hope to see you all very soon
