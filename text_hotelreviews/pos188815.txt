the decor was beautiful and the hotel was beautiful in general there was still building work going on as it had only been open days when we arrived so wasn t entirely complete but this did not effect our stay in the slightest there was no noise and they kept on top of the cleanliness it also reflected in the price we paid as i don t think if we stayed again it would be soo cheap i would definitely stay again though and the bed it was sooo sooo comfortable
