we noticed there was a bed topper and this was really appreciated and made a difference thank you the toiletries supplied were lovely as were the slippers and bathrobes free wifi fantastic tea and coffee supplies were great too the spa and gym facilities were the reason we booked the hotel and were very good but it would have been better without children having so much access time the locality of the hotel was a bonus and near the st paul s underground and mins walk from barts hospital which is why we were there in the first place we felt safe walking around in the evening and took a sneaky peak at st paul s from the floor of the hotel really great view
