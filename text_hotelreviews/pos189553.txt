the hotel was great breakfast was excellent staff very pleasant unfortunately we had a bad experience at the day spa my husband arrived on friday th around and booked the extra night he asked to book a massage for both myself and him for the sunday at the staff said there was no problem with that the next day they cancelled the massage apparently they over booked so my husband asked if we could still use the facilities steam juccuzi and was told that would be fine we arrived at no one to greet and the spa door was locked we knocked but no answer we waited and around mins later knocked again around a very upset massage women stormed out screaming at us in french stating we were banging on the door and she was going to call the police very disturbing as we were only wanting to relax i think that if the spa isn t part of the hotel it should be made clear and perhaps booking should be sorted out through them only anyway we still had a wonderful time in paris as coming from australia is a long way we would hesitate to stay with you again but would investigate another spa experience regards liane lancaster
