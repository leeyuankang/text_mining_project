le mathurin maybe a great location to base an extended holiday in paris with dozens of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk but for business the streets outside are relentlessly noisy lots of mopeds motorbikes and street chatter to keep you occupied through the night the hotel is however conveniently located next door to the financial services district and deserves a mention for its cleanliness comfortable beds and general decor
