the staff were fabulous really helpful and accomodating i booked at about after an awful airbnb experience and they got back to me the same night and let me drop my bags off at they apologised for the lack of balcony despite my late booking the room was big enough for me great bathroom and separate lavatory big windows and dark curtains for a good night s sleep air conditioning very central and close to metro and a nice breakfast cafe nice facilities downstairs to sit and read and relax
