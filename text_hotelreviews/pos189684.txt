the lobby and common areas were in a word charming comfortable full of character expertly decorated our room was also beautiful and the lighting was excellent although it was on the small side not unexpected as we booked an economy double just be informed the bathroom was sized proportionally to the room fine for us but i can see how this might be a problem for any travelers with mobility issues again not unexpected just be informed the bed was very comfortable and the linens were of very nice quality overall the hotel was very peaceful and relaxing the location could not have been better it was close to public transit and within walking distance of restaurants attractions shops etc but did not feel overly touristy
