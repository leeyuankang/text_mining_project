right next to st pauls lots of bars in hotel and within short walking distance of tube st pauls breakfast is expensive as expected but we went to cafe rouge on the corner per person and views of st pauls would loved to have used the many facilities more but we were out most of the time as we did a walking tour in the evening from st pauls tube with london walks hidden pubs of clerkenwell fire alarm at was not pleasant but what can you do someone smoking in a non smoking area hotel is lovely and clean and rooms comfortable and well equipt i think you would appreciate this hotel if making use of all facilities including spa it is a shame to only use it fleetingly
