really great little find perfect for going to wimbledon staff were extremely kind and helpful the room i was in was spotlessly clean modern and bright advertised as single but the bed was a large single for sure on the main road but really not too noisy at all breakfast at the cafe next door was superb again lovely and clean place lovely decor you can also sit outside not too expensive either for london out of if i get luckly enough to get tickets for wimbledon again i will definitely be back here
