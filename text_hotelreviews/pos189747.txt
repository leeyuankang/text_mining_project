hotel is welcoming with a cafe style curb appeal very nice lady on reception check in was fast was even shown to my room i had the basic room so the shower room is downstairs however it was spotlessly clean with a brand new power shower bed was comfortable so that plus the hotel being on a quietish road mean t i grabbed an excellent night s sleep had to dash in the morning so can t comment on the breakfast but there were some lovely aromas as i approached the reception area perfect location for everything in wimbledon right next to all transport links
