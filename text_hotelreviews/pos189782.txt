i was super happy and grateful to find through booking com this gem of hotel which provided on site parking it s in such a great location two blocks from the high street of wimbledon with an abundance of shops restaurants and pubs and then just down a bit is the train station to get into london i had a single room with ensuite and it was all sparkling clean and cosy small and compact but plenty of room to move have cases out etc double wardrobe desk side table plenty of breeze from the double window if you wanted it as with a lot of small hotels there s no aircon there is heating which is more necessary in the uk however there is a fan if it gets a little warm shower was great with good pressure and plenty of hot water you need to run the tap a while before it comes through the hotel wasn t full when i was there so i found it very quiet and i love quiet the staff from my first interaction were so lovely and helpful everyone i saw on the reception desk as i passed in and out each day said hello and a chat which i enjoyed you do have to get your cases up the stairs so know that or ask for a ground floor room what a bonus is the beautiful cafe attached now to the hotel the staff and food all fabulous and healthy and there is outside seating under trees also good coffee a rarity in the uk and they have almond milk inside the cafe is gorgeous as well fresh cold pressed juices and smoothies wonderful healthy salads and raw food desserts what a gem to find this i could not fault the hotel or anything about it i loved it and will definitely recommend to everyone and will go back when i next visit london they are also sending me my chargers because like a dill i left them in the wall sockets sorry i had a lovely three nights
