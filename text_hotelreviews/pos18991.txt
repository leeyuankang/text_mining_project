staff were really friendly and helpful gave us an upgrade plus breakfast when we asked at checkin whether a fridge was available in the room we were able to check in early although we hadn t booked this ahead it was a great location for city of london we had planned to visit the tower of london and greenwich both of which we could get to easily walking boat after we checked out we could leave our bags and pick up later which meant extra time for sightseeing
