very clean and elegant looked amazing from the inside and out great location and our room had a good view of st pauls cathedral spacious rooms and comfortable beds at an extremely good price compared to other upper end hotels in the city didn t get time to use the spa facilities unfortunately but would definitely recommend this hotel to others
