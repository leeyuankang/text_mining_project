i have stayed at the hotel before so i knew what to expect what i didn t expect was a lovely upgrade to a club room as i was there with my husband to celebrate my birthday this was a wonderfully spacious room with a seating area and plenty wardrobe space the bathroom was well stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries the location of the hotel is fabulous and this is one of the reasons we stay there with regent oxford street just on the door step it s wonderful to stroll through the gardens and be at selfridges turn right when you go out the front door and this takes you down to regent street we didn t eat at the hotel but enjoyed a few cocktails there expensive but it is london the breakfast was plentiful but not warm enough my scrambles eggs were well made but cold so i left them the cold buffet was lovely though with lots of cereal crossiants etc request toast and it comes freshly made the reception staff were very friendly and efficient and although we arrived before the actual check in time our room was ready i d highly recommend this hotel and already planning another stay
