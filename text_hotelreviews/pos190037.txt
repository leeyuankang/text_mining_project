the location of the hotel is excellent with just minutes by foot to oxford street and to bond street underground station many tourist attractions are also within a walking distance the hotel still has an old world charm to it added with modern comfort we found the club room with access to the lounge excellent value for money the staff was helpful and friendly all in all a great experience would definitely recommend
