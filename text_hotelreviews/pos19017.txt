we were moved into the grange hotel suites which were around the corner from the hotel this wasn t a problem for us and the weather was so nice that a brief minute walk to the main hotel was fine to go and get breakfast they had included this free of charge because we were in the suites the bed was very hard but perhaps some people would prefer that breakfast had a good buffet selection and the location is perfect the roof terrace on the floor gives you a great view of st paul s and the shard
