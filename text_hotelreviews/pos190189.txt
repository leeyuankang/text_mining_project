overall the hotel was ok we were put in a room out the back right next to the air and vent units so quite noisy breakfast would have been better if we were offered the full options by the staff however we weren t lots of staff so i would have expected the same service we have booked many times with booking and i do find that the hotels always put you in a lower spec or smaller room
