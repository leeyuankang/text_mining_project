superb choice of items for breakfast but make sure you pay in advance it is much pricier if not good size room and bed welcome tray with tea and coffee though no biscuits avoid the minibar in the room it is expensive smart hotel situated within a short stroll of hyde park and right on grosvenor square near the american embassy
