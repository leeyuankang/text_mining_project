we had access to the executive bar lounge the member of staff allowed it to stay open till around instead of closing an hour earlier so we could finish up a late business meeting with a client check in out was very quick and easy and the staff gave a warm greeting and goodbye the room was a good size and very clean it is also in a great quiet location in central london
