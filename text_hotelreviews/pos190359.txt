really beautiful location infront of grosvenor park much more attractive entrance at the front rather than the rear in particular the man who was looking after guests in the club lounge is excellent he really changed our impression of the hotel after having to wait for our room to be prepared he is a massive asset to the hotel and made our experience all the better thanks to this excellent member of staff
