the hotel itself is gorgeous definitely worth the money the staff was very lovely and accommodating many bars and restaurants throughout the hotel our room was spacious and very very nice lots of room for my mom and i to get relax and get ready to explore the city the hotel looks like pure luxury both inside and out the breakfast was great too full english plus continental breakfast items would definitely stay again and it was in the best location you could see st paul s cathedral from the front door as it was right behind it
