the entire hotel was wonderful the staff were plentiful but unobstrusive they were there if you needed them but otherwise your privacy was secured the whole place is filled with glass which gives an open clean experience the room was divine and a wonderful view of st pauls and the top of the shard the turn down service was a lovely surprise we have decided to spoil ourselves here again we travel a fair bit and this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed thank you
