this place is a little jewel of paris i wanted something particularly french for my visit and hotel varenne was everything i had hoped for i chose one of the larger suites which was worth every cent the room was large the bed so comfy and the room was beautiful they even have an elevator albeit tiny but many parisian and french hotels don t have that luxury the staff are all so friendly and helpful and catered to my needs beautifully and gracefully there is a grocery store across the street an organic store also and a patisserie bakery right next door with delicious croissants to go there are also many places to eat within walking distance the heavenly rodin museum in the next street les invalides a short stroll metro very close minutes walk only a minute walk to the musee d orsay and yet this part of town is not as chaotic as other parts i visited i would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again anytime i come to paris do be aware that you need to hand in your key each time you leave even if it s just next door to grab a croissant however given the number of pickpockets around and the level of hotel and room details on your key this is for your own safety as much as theirs there is a safe in the room which was big enough to store all my precious items and seriously i forgot to lock it one day and none of my stuff was touched overall my experience was that it s a great place to stay
