a quiet extremely comfortable charming hotel perfectly located for all the popular sights of paris the staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly not only did they recommend restaurants and allow my daughter to practice her high school french they also managed to track down a mobile phone one of our party had left in a taxi to the airport and have it back to us prior to boarding truly amazing service i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough our spacious suite with immaculate bathroom was the perfect accommodation for me and my teenage girls close to key metro stations so travel very easy and a neighbourhood with great boulangeries fresh fruit convenience stores and restaurants can t wait to return
