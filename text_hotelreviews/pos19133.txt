booked the hotel for my daughters birthdays they were upgraded to an executive suite with queen beds and came in to cupcakes and a happy birthday message it really made their trip very jealous that i didn t go with them they said the staff were fabulous and couldn t do enough for them many thanks to them all we would strongly recommend this hotel for quality service and its central location when visiting london
