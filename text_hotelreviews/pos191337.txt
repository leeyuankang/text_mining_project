i love the arrondissement the hotel is in a quiet street yet minutes walking to saint germain and walking distance to all type of shoppings from zara to prada it is a small cosy charming hotel so clean so nice very confortable they have a real hairdryer not the one hanging from the wall and barely blowing air it is the only hotel where i use the shampoo and shower soap they use hermes any restaurant you pick in the area is delicious
