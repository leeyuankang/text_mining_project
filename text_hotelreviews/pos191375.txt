gorgeous hotel has an exclusive feel my husband and i were made to feel important as soon as we came in the concierge andrew could not be more helpful the staff in the rooftop resturant were also friendly and attentive although we didnt use it the swimming pool was a nice touch the hotel bedroom was well set out it was our anniversary and we were left some lovely sweets and a card which was very thoughtful the comfortable beds huge tv large bathroom and shower come steam room cool retro touches all added to the mood of the place we danced the night away in the live music room for a new hotel the curtain really surpassed my expectations and deserves every one of its stars
