this hotel is of exceptional quality for my high standards every member of staff were extremely accommodating from the receptionist to the cleaning lady the hotel room was immaculately clean and spacious the bed was comfortable and large the shower gel and other goodies were of superior quality and the shower was satisfyingly strong we spent nights in quiet bliss not a sound to be heard even though the hotel looked generally busy the swimming pool and other spa facilities were lovely too there is a certain ambiance of relaxation
