absolutely loved my stay at the grange tower bridge hotel the staff were so helpful and attentive upon arrival we were upgraded to executive suite view was amazing thank you unfortunately we couldn t use the pool or spa as we were feeling a little under the weather but we will be coming back again to do just that can t wait
