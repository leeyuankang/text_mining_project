the staff were so lovely and really made the stay so brilliant the spa was incredible and the rooms were even better than imagined with a perfect view and gorgeous bathroom there wasn t anything more we could ask for would recommend the wetherspoons by the hotel instead of hotel breakfast as its a lot cheaper and you get more for your money but thats personal preference
