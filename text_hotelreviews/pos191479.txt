the whole experience was outstanding and have already started planning my second trip the room facilities were amazing especially the shower the spa was out of this world as well as the service from the staff throughout the hotel the tower grill restuarant was satisfying and the room service the nachos and pasta to be precise was just a dream felt like kevin mccallister from home alone
