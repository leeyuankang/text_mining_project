the pool and spa facilities were very nice a lap pool with lanes and a nice jacuzzi kids are only allowed in the pool at certain times which we liked as it allows for a nice relaxing swim the free wifi was very good and extremely fast best hotel wifi i ever encoutered location was great in a nice neighbourhood with enough shops pubs and restaurants and close to the subway so it s easy to get around london
