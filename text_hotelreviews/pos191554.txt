the staff were very helpful and attentive we stayed for a birthday and they surprised us with a birthday cake in the room when we returned the hotel was spotlessly clean and very modern we ate breakfast in the bar area and this was much better value than eating in the main restaurant the food was excellent and drinks in the evening were reasonably priced for a hotel in central london the location is brilliant for visiting the tower of london and is close to tube and rail stations views from the room were excellent
