we stayed here before a cruise and saved lots of booking through booking com lovely spacious room and very quiet we used the pool hot tub sauna which is complementary i discovered their neat swim suit spinner in the changing room so our swimsuits dryed overnight a short walk brings you to tower of london and we got there early and beat the summer crowds lots of nice places to eat nearby a great breakfast place is just across the street we ate there twice
