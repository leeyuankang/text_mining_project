we stayed for one night having travelled down to see family in the london marathon the hotel was great the staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for you the room was clean the bed was so comfortable and all of the facilities are second to none we ate food in the restaurant and the bar and on both occasions were excellent would stay here again and definitely recommend to anyone
