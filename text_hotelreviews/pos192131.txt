le tsuba was a beautiful hotel and in a great location it was very near the arc de triomphe and both metro and rer transit connections the staff was incredibly friendly and they were very accommodating throughout i was supposed to be staying for nights with my wife and month old daughter however i had to adjust my stay at the last minute shortened from nights to nights due to my daughter not receiving her visa in time they let me modify even after the booking com deadline which was greatly appreciated they were also very child friendly providing a portable crib and kid friendly bathroom soaps etc even though i didn t use them the room was bright clean and comfortable with a great bathroom highly recommended
