this is a brand new hotel tastefully decorated and with well appointed spotless rooms great location few minutes walking to place charles de gaulle etoile and to metro stations including the important line despite the proximity to the etoile and champs lys es the neighborhood feels local rather than touristic breakfast is good and the staff is very friendly
