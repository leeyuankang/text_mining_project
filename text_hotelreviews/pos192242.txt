the best location in the middle of everything got a room with a bath room over the entrance some sounds from outside especially if a van was parked for some time with the engine running but i had asked for a room this side so expected some noise did not hear anything during the night because i slept well i prefer the mattress a little softer but that s me breakfast very good their granola the best perhaps the main reason i had breakfast there more than one morning staff very kind and helpful had a little problem with the regulation of the temperature solved instantly when mentioned they cared about their guests
