staff were always ready to help hotel was great in terms of atmosphere and comfort especially with two teenagers rooms are bright and well equipped and our rooms had a great view down the lane it is a fantastic location for shopping sightseeing and theatre but at heart of the business centre so we were all catered for customer service by managers was superior to most of the other hotels we have stayed in in london
