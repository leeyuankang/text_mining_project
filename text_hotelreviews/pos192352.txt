one of our favourite hotels in europe the location is absolutely perfect the staff is friendly extremely efficient and know their stuff the concierges get you tables at the good restaurants and help you get tickets the breakfast buffet has most of the food one might want and more dishes can be ordered a la carte room enough and quiet enough for a meeting over breakfast not much more one could want
