st martin s lane hotel has decent facilities i booked last minute and got a queen room which was fine if small the bed was comfortable the bathroom was basic but passable and the view was quite nice it is worth noting that everything in the minibar was extremely old the chocolate was all white and hardened but on the whole the hotel was very underwhelming for the price i ve stayed in far better london hotels for far less
