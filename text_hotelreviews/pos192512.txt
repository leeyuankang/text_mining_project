it was my birthday and immediately on learning this the receptionist upgraded my room i was also given a complimentary birthday gift which was such a wonderful surprise i nearly cried as i was alone it was so kind of the staff to make a fuss of me and i can t thank them enough all the staff are so helpful and have a relaxed manner but remain exceptionally polite my room was fabulous pure white with nothing out of place and nothing but that which was elegant such as the main lights at night the lighting could be used to paint your choice from the delectable range of colours at your fingertips i have stayed in my room all day the hotel interior is beautiful very spacious modern and light the furniture and art work are modern with a sense of humour and are my favourite style of decoration best use is made of lighting for colour effect and a purity of space is achieved by the ethereal whiteness of the high walls i simply love it it is within walking distance of the coliseum for the english national opera i am disabled and even i could manage the walk room service is friendly and helpful and the choice of dining is amazing i can t wait to go back
