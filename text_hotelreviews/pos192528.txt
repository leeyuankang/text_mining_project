this was one of the most superb boutique hotels i have stayed in funky sophisticated comfortable welcoming staff were polite friendly and accommodating i really liked the way that they were not manufactured personalities like most hotels from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you put your head on the divine pillow you are immersed in a total experience of the senses sensational location in st martins lane
