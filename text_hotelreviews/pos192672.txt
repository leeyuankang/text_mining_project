the location was extremely convenient and the hotel is really nice the bar and restaurant were so much fun even though the food is disappointing it is so legendary that you are enjoying every minutes of it i also loved that the mini bar was complimentary i was not expecting it and it was a nice surprised the staff is so nice smart and welcoming they really make the hotel i just cannot wait to see what they are doing with the renovation and stay there again i loved the place and encourage you to stay there if you can
