the staff was so accommodating when we needed to check our bags prior to check in and after check out to help accommodate our travel plans the breakfast buffet was very solid the location just south of the thames was a manageable walking distance to blackfriar s bridge and the adjacent riverwalk scene the southwark tube station made transfer to the airport super easy on the day we left london
