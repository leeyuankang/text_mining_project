we had a wonderful stay the hotel really went above and beyond to make sure our first family holiday to london was as exciting as we had hoped for i had asked the hotel to provide a little birthday wish for my year old son and they really made sure to acknowledge him and give that little extra touch which makes such a difference thanks to the staff
