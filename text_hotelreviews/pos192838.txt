room was a good size for the three of us mom dad and yr old son lots of outlets and roomy bath breakfast was plentiful and had something for everyone decent coffee to boot more of a business area so quiet at night not a bustling tourist area but easy to get all the sights walk to imperial war museum which is amazing
