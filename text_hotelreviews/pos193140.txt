we had several expectations that were all met within walking distance from gare du nord minutes and it never felt unsafe close to a metro stop one minute from cadet near restaurants enough space for a family of four and quiet at night i had not stayed in paris since my honeymoon years ago so the modern feel and the relative size of the room and bathroom surprised me compared to my memories of the other hotel i had stayed at one nice touch was usb ports along the bed frame for charging phones breakfast was included and had a good variety of hot and cold items and it was very filling my wife is a self described poor sleeper who wakes up at the slightest sound or if the mattress pillow is uncomfortable and she slept through both nights so that s got to be saying something our room was by the elevator which we never heard at night and if there were occupants above or below us we didn t hear them the heating ac system was very modern and was quiet not like units that clunk on and off and whir loudly in a lot of american chain hotels i ve slept at the desk staff spoke english to varying degrees of course and were patient with my attempts to converse in french we were able to leave our luggage after checkout so that we could explore the city before our train departure at p m the most unique feature was that we were sent a survey prior to check in to learn a little about us and ask whether we had any special needs or wishes i e suggestions of restaurants that served gluten free meals and the response was quick and detailed my wife and i have probably stayed in over hotels between us for work and pleasure and have never gotten something like that we had a good feeling about the hotel from the beginning and it was a good experience until the end
