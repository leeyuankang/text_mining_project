the staff couldn t have been more helpful i took my pet chihuahua with me they had made her a bed in our room and put bowls out ready for our arrival the hotel facilities are out of this world went out in the evening and when we came back the staff had already changed our towels and brought us fresh bath robes we thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel
