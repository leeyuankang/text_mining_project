i think not i would not rate this hotel as only one robe provided for a deluxe suit for two no water provided dirty sheets prolonged room service no spa or pool on site as stated secluded location within inner london late night partys held within rooms with no respect given to working visitors food not up to standard drug use on the permises which is overlooked by staff overall not an ideal hotel
