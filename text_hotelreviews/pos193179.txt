very friendly and helpful staff we were there very briefly as we had a ball to go to on the saturday evening and then were up early to ride the ridelondon it was a great location for the start of the ride and we were allowed to leave our car for the day at no extra charge expensive for so few hours there but would stay there again next year and hopefully for longer next time
