the staff were all amazing from the greeting at the door the moment we arrived everything was taken care of and we were made to feel welcome valued and that they cared about the little things like where our car was parked and helping with the luggage which had been left in the car we had been unable to park outside the hotel due to a road closure nearby and massive of roadworks which totally confused the satnav and had made finding the hotel at all quite stressful all taken care of and car moved for us so we didn t have to go back for the luggage luggage bought up to our room within minutes as it was my birthday the house sent up a beautiful cake that was a complete surprise we loved the staff they were all lovely and were genuinely interested in our plans and wanting to know if there was anything they could do to help us get the most out of our stay the room had a huge window with an amazing view of the river and the shard the bay window seat allowed us to sit and take it all in as the light changed with the onset of evening loved it from start to finish and didn t want to leave
