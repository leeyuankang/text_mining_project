a very nice hotel with lovely friendly staff i travelled with my sister for a shopping trip and we had a fabulous time the hotel was in the perfect location for the shops and close to bond street tube station and hyde park the staff were very welcoming and even put a bottle of prosecco in our room in the evening which was a lovely touch after hours walking up and down oxford street and we would like to thank the member of staff who did that for us we unfortunately didn t get to use the pool but it looks lovely and we would certainly return to the hotel in the future thank you
