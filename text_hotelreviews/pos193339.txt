love my fitness so the gym and pool did the trick both are well managed with great training staff and equipment even finally managed a spin on the watt bike trendy neighborhood with nice restaurants and pubs all over good for shopping as close to oxford st but still feels far removed from the hustle and bustle great and attentive staff check in and check out was seamless top place with a boutique feel
