perfect location close to central london short walk to oxford st and bond st tube station lots of great places to shop and eat nearby try the ivy caf standard rooms are quite small but the delux and above are good size for london very comfortable and well decorated generally staff all extremely helpful breakfast was good quality in a nice space but the high point is the access to the private gym spa and pool which are outstanding
