fantastic location for the oxford and marylebone street shops but down a quiet side street staff were amazing including the yoga instructor at the gym on saturday morning beautiful breakfasts excellent room service and the beds don t remember much except my head hitting the fluffy pillow after a long fun filled day loved the marylebone hotel from the moment we arrived until the moment we sadly had to leave
