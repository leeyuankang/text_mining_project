the hotel was outstanding as expected with friendly staff we were given a complimentary upgrade as we were staying at the hotel for our anniversary the room service breakfast was fantastic and the complimentary nibbles provided on our first night sealed the deal overall great hotel in a great location with amazing staff the only let down was the spa did not have a jacuzzi which we were hoping for
