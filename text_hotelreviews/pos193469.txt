the location is amazing a variety of coffee shops near by oxford st is min walk and it s a fun min walk to regent park a personal favorite spot the service and staff are very friendly and helpful my favorite thing about the hotel is that has a cozy lobby seating area that has a homelike feeling the couch by the fireplace is perfect to relax after a long walk in london love it
