the hotel is located in a nice quiet area with an easy short walk to the underground station our room was ready early and it was lovely the last night of our stay my daughter got sick and the concierge desk was wonderful they helped me book a car to the airport the food was great there was a fresh juice bar on site we would recommend this location and hotel to anyone visiting london
