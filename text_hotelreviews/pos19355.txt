this was the quietest hotel i have ever stayed in we were spending a weekend at the theatre at the barbican and it was only a short walk from the hotel to the venue we swam in the pool at the hotel which was lovely the changing facilities were very good we booked in very easily were earlier than check in time but able to go to our room we are both quite tall so chose a room with twin beds so we could sleep well both beds were doubles so we could sleep without our feet hanging out of the bottom and the beds were really comfortable
