most of all i loved the location it s very close to the main steets and shopping district and at the same time in a quite neighborhood all your needs market hair salon coffee shops at a stone throw i also liked the coziness feel i dislike hotels with grand entrances and lobby all staff members were helpful and kind from the bellboys to reception to the concierge and the staff working at breakfast i would like to especially thank mr gunter for his help and guidance throughout our stay grecelia from housekeeping kept our rooms well organized and clean i also would like to thank all the concierge staff don t recall their names they were a great help
