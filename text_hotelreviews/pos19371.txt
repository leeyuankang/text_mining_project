the location how clean the room was thoughtful gesture off birthday cake and plate decoration in our room as was my birthday the staff member who helped with our parking on last day as was a private parking area a well run hotel daily paper at door a nice touch no complaints nothing about the hotel but a car park is but minutes walk away and cost only per day at weekends yes per day and per hour at other times great price for central london
