when we arrived we were greeted by sonya at the front desk who was very friendly and gave us so much info and help all the staff of the hotel were very friendly and professional our rooms were bigger than we expected and the beds were very comfortable location was within walking distance to the louvre and alot of restaurants and shops around too overall we had a great stay and definitely recommend this hotel
