the staff was excellent they were very friendly and definitely took the time to speak with you and get to know you a little i arrived early to check in so they gave me a complimentary upgrade to one of their two suites free of charge definitely a great hotel and it centered perfectly in paris just a short walk to several landmarks shopping and restaurants are right on the corner with many more jus a few minutes away by walking perfect location
