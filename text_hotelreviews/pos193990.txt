the staff was great everyone was very friendly and helpful the hotel was clean and well maintained also a very good location walking distance to many sites and shopping and only a block from the metro the breakfast was good though i don t know that i d pay separately for it the standard rooms are small but probably a better value than the upgraded larger rooms which are nice but perhaps overpriced
