located in a smart side street with several restaurants and bars but little traffic turn the corner and there was the louvre check in expected us the superior rooms sq ft very spacious lovely ensuite bath with shower over but room looked onto courtyard which was rather bleak i had previously requested room a view so perhaps no superior rooms onto the street
