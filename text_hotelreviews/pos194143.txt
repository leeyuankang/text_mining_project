i had to make some late changes to my booking and the guy on reception was really helpful pro actively stepping in to make sure i could keep the same room when i had to stay an extra day room was a good size with comfortable although a little small beds well stocked mini bar i didn t get chance to use the on site restaurant but it looked good and seems very popular
