the property might not be in the best area but it was clean quiet and had everything i needed even a fridge with juice and sweets which were paid for on departure if consumed it was a lot quieter than i expected being on a road and near the hospital i never heard a thing not even other guests no banging doors or heels despite the wooden floor in the room facilities to make tea and coffee as well i d certainly return
