the room was spacious and a great bath tub very clean my son was filming in whitechapel so the location was great very quiet mini bar in the room and the food and drink were not over priced it enabled me to store some fresh milk for tea and coffee as well as a few sandwiches i wish all hotel rooms had a small bar fridge we stayed in room this was an twin executive room
