rooms are small but if you re ok with that this is a great bolthole in a cool and up coming part of the city close to brick lane front desk were incredibly helpful and rooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed would benefit from hour room service as it was past midnight when i checked in and the restaurant was closed but overall would thoroughly recommend
