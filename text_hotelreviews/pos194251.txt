the experience was exceptional i have travel a lot for business and have stayed at luxury hotels and this hotel was superb the staff and the upgrades of it being a modern chic hotel was awesome i loved the diversity in the neighborhood as well with eclectic food and the multicultural atmosphere it was close enough to city center but far enough to enjoy the charm of london absolutely lovely
