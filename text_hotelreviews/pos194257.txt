we stayed at the penthouse bedrooms comfortable beds but the second bedroom has more like a sofa rather than a bed apartment was very nice clean newly equiped nice view fully equipped kitchen staff very friendly great location from distance point of view min walk to tube min walk to london tower easy reach to city center direct bus lines very close some nice restaurants in walking distance
