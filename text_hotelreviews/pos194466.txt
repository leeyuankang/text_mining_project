i got a deal on a single room which was a great price for paris the location was great and it was very quiet minute walk to george v metro stop i am not a fan of the champs neighbourhood i prefer le marais and st germain de pres and would rather stay there next time as i did not go to paris to see fancy stores regardless if you want to go the c e area for most of your stay it is very well situated the room was clean people at the front desk were very helpful and nice
