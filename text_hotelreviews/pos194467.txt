very nice staff i was traveling with my family two children and olivia from reception staff made a very nice check in we loved the design touch in the hotel decoration the bed is good globally is a very nice hotel for family traveling with a great balance between price and quality the breakfast offer can be improved the ideia of having someone delivering at your suite a basket with bread croissant and chocolate bread is very good but something is missing maybe including fresh fruit but this did not affect our experience suggestion to the staff continue to make an effort in hotel maintenance and people will love it
