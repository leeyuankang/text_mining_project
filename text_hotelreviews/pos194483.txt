the hotel was in a great location just few minutes walking away from the champs elysee metro station and rer the suite was fully equipped with kitchenette which made our life easier for making a quick meal and there are few supermarkets near the hotel for buying your stuff the staff were very helpful and friendly we would highly recommend it as for sure will be staying there again if we intended to travel to paris
