very happy in room it was in the basement so just one flight of steps to navigate the room was spacious had air conditioning and a fridge king size bed cot and seating area great news for us when we had a baby and it was so hot outside we were visiting the us embassy so had to check out at so couldn t have breakfast but the staff kindly allowed us to leave our suitcase for a couple of hours until after our appointment which saved us a lot of trouble
