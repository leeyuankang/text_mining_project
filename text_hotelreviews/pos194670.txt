we slept well here floors up on the back facing west is at least insulated from car noise from the street feels private as other buildings are fairly distant nice for a crowded city room was fairly spacious provision of a fan without a long enough cord was valued good drawer and hanging space for clothing wi fi access great location for getting out into the city with many breakfast and meal places nearby thus we didn t eat in the hotel at breakfast clean towels daily hot water even if pressure is low
