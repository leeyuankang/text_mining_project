a great location very central welcoming helpful staff we had a room on the first floor which meant only one flight of stairs and the manager carried our bags for my daughter and i the room was small and along with the bathroom is somewhat dated with dark furniture but it was quite acceptable the fan was welcome as it was hot when we stayed this hotel is very good value for money which is its best asset just a few minute s walk from oxford street marble arch and marylebone road recommended
