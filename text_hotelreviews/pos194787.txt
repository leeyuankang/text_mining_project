it s the perfect hotel for a citytrip in paris our room wasn t that spacious but nevertheless really comfortable we had a great balcony with which overlooked rue lafayette and had a view of the top of the eiffel tower galleries lafayette is only a min walk away and the trainstation of paris nord only minutes of walking the staff was really helpfull and super friendly
