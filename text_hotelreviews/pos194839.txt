this was a lovely little place to stay not to far from some of the main sights of paris we enjoyed the arty nature of the decor and the staff were very friendly and spoke good english it was very close to a metro station which is helpful for getting around and our room was nice and comfy we had a superior room which was a good size but still quite small so i cant imagine how small the standard rooms were the bed was good the tv and the bathroom would recommend for a short stay
