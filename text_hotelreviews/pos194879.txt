the bed was very comfortable decor in the hotel is modern retro and not dated at all the staff were so helpful and very lovely to chat to for both of our evenings they recommended us two great restaurants the hotel was clean and fresh smelling shower was nice and hot we even were given robes and slippers great location it was just couple of metro stops from gar du nord and a couple stops in the other direction to the louvre close enough to travel but far away enough from the touristic traffic thanks for a great stay
