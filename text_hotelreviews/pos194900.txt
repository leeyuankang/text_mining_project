we loved the room especially beacuse it was on the top floor with the small balcony overlooking the roofs of paris and the eiffel tower in the distance really nice and quiet neighbourhood proximity to the city center place de la concorde some minutes by foot metro station is almost in front some meters away from the hotel the satff is very pleasant and helpful breakfast is just fine
