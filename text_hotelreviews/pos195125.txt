i especially liked the cheerful helpful staff everyday they greeted me with a cheery good morning and when i returned they said welcome back in such a nice genuine way my room was always immaculate the bathroom was nicely cleaned and fittings best and shiny the manager during my stay was a mr savio sp and he was so helpful to me every day his attention to detail was second to none and o really felt he genuinely cared that my trip was a success and that i was comfortable this is a very neat and pleasant hotel with excellent professional staff
