someone with taste and style has decorated this property the rich wood trim tasteful paintings clean white bedding modern bathroom plumbing all made the property beautiful and my stay there felt like a treat their best advantage is they are on a quiet side street a couple of short blocks from a nice busy street full of public transport options and helpful businesses for travelers restaurants shops atms plus they are a short walk to the beautiful kensington park and within an easy walk of at least three tube stations including the very useful notting gate hill circle line connecting to lots of london touristy things a couple of comfort things i especially valued were the room air conditioner not a given in many london hotels very appreciated in summer and the lift elevator
