they provide breakfast for per day which you can pre purchase when you check in if you want it is small but for me traveling on business it was perfect the rooms and command areas are clean and well maintained savino is very attentive to his guests needs and the entire staff takes care and pride in what they are doing i will definitely use them again on the next trip
