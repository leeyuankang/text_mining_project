over the years i have stayed at many hotels in london for me this hotel represents the best style of accommodation on all levels that i have found the atmosphere is friendly and the level of staff hospitality is exceptional the rooms are well appointed and tastefully furnished and are all done with the comfort of guests in mind the hotel is situated in a very desirable part of inner london where accommodation of a similar standard in nearby hotels is frequently far more expensive i cannot recommend the premier notting hill highly enough
