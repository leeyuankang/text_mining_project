great location notting hill gate kensington high street portobello road and hyde park is a short stroll away i took the airport express from stansted and walked to the hotel from paddington station it was easy to find the area is lovely and feels very safe the neighborhood is quiet so it was easy to fall asleep at night very friendly staff the room was clean i would definitely go there again because of the location and the decent price i had a very comfortable stay
