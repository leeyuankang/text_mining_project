staff were incredibly welcoming and courteous the room was on the small side for the price but we also appreciate it is london and it is peak season our room was clean and very comfortable we had a lovely room on the third floor overlooking the square as it was very warm the ac came in very handy though it wasn t feasible to have it switched on all night because of the noise it made the only negative was a group of people outside playing football basketball at five o clock in the morning
