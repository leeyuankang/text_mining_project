this hotel is perfectly situated the area is quiet and lovely the view from my room was great i found the staff most helpful they went out of their way to accommodate any and all requests my only complaint would be with the bed the mattress wasn t all that comfortable as it dipped on one side i also found the duvet heavy and far to warm and had to request a regular blanket and sheet other than that i would definitely stay here again strongly recommend requesting a room in the front of the building i was originally booked into a back room over a very loud air conditioning system sounded like a jet engine taking off every few minutes the staff were great about changing rooms for me
