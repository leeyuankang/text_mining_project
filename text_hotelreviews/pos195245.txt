upon arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been automatically upgraded from the deluxe room to the executive room our executive room was split into two floors a bedroom on the first and a bathroom on the second which had a jacuzzi bathtub the decor was tasteful and with character deep stained wooden cupboards and wardrobes and a very comfortable bed with a cushioned headboard definitely would recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again
