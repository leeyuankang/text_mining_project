i was out in a basement room called felix single but there was no diredt day light the winow was opaque and there was just a hint of light the curtains were closed in arrival which was clearly to hide the fact that this was not a suitable room there was no bacon or pork sausages i think this may have been to do with religious reasons which should be made clear at the booking stage
