my single room was in the basement and a little dark but it was clean and comfortable and had everything i needed for one nights stay whilst on a training course in london a cooked breakfast in the price was very reasonable too the receptionist was very friendly and welcoming as was the porter on the door the friendliness of the staff here is a real plus point for the hotel i felt safe as a lone female traveller
