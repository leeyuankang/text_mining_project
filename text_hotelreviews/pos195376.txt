the location was great and convenient to kensington gardens portobello road etc without being in the middle of high traffic and loud noise the prince of wales pub down the street was great a short walk to bayswater station gets you on the circle line the management tried very hard to make sure we were comfortable i complained about the bed as soon as i got there horribly jet lagged and irate they promptly and pleasantly upgraded me remember you really don t go to london to stay in hotel unless you re an incognito celebrity you go to explore sleep and explore some more for us this was perfectly fine
