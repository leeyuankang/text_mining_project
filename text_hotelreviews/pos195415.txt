we were initially booked into another hotel but on arrival were told works were being done so we needed to go to a sister hotel via taxi which they paid for we arrived at this hotel it s a gorgeous building with very modern features when we arrived to the room we weren t happy there was a window but it was covered with curtain on the outside so we didn t have a view we asked to move and the next room was great a view overlooking the front the room is very clean towels are changed if you put them on the floor in the bathroom i m not too sure about the bed sheets tea coffee topped up daily no outside noise the morning staff at breakfast are excellent can t help you enough and very efficient the breakfast itself is amazing lots of choice for me veggie and my mum who is picky you don t feel rushed even though the staff never stop you can get the bus on the main road which is approx a min walk from the hotel to the bus stop this takes you right into oxford road the hotel is approx mins from euston train station or you could walk across kensington gardens hyde park instead of the bus it s a long walk but worth it it s lovely
