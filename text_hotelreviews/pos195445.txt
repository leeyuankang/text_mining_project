the hotel reception was welcoming and we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of water all of the staff were very helpful and friendly and they even printed out some underground routes for our stay the room was cosy and clean with all the facilities expected and the towels were nice and fluffy the shower was lovely and hot every time we used it and toiletries were also provided the pictures on the website are a good representation of the room we stayed in the hotel was in a good location and we felt safe walking to and from the bayswater station even around midnight which only took around minutes thank you to the hotel staff we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would most definitely return
