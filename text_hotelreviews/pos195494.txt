the price of this hotel was incredibly for the quality of the accomodation my room was upgraded which was wonderful and had a fridge and microwave which made my stay even better the location of the hotel is slightly away from the tourist hotspots which was fine for me and the staff were helpful and friendly the fitness room was very small and basic home style cross trainers but the fact that there was a fitness room at all is excellent for this price
