i booked a deluxe double room indicated for people even if i was alone number the meeting at the reception was really nice the receptionist are friendly and kind the bed was comfortable the position is good you still have to walk minutes to get to the central line that bring you to the city center but the surround is calm a nice park in the front of the hotel
