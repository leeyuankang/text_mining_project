really good and stylish hotel located very central bayswater underground is only minutes away so very good transport links breakfast is really good and fresh and the service in general is fantastic especially alexandra at the reception who upgraded us for free and offered us a bottle of wine and fruits basket as it was my birthday highly recommended and we will be back very soon
