i liked this hotel because it felt like all the quality of a chain hotel but with an exclusive feel the staff at the front desk were very cheery and the cleanliness of the room was perfect the double bed was also a good size along with the tv the location is also in a nice quiet square in a nice area of london not too far to commute to the city centre where my work do was
