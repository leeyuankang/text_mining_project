the hotel and staff were great how ever i spend a lot of time in london and everytime i stay in the area but i wouldn t stay here again due to a problem with the noise in our room and it was not dealt with correctly by management lady who kind of said we were lying so know i will be submitting my video to solicitor to get our full refund back
