we stayed in the club room which was very spacious would not have liked to see how small a normal room was though staff were very welcoming took our luggage for us and were very helpful in keeping our luggage after we had checked out also offered tourist advice on the area complimentary wine fruit and drinks were also a delight housekeeping good
