we paid around for nights here the staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful the location was great very close to a few tube stops the bathroom was a good size and the bed was comfy yes the room was small we chose the basic room it did require a little organisation of luggage and manoeuvring but we expected this after reading other reviews and didn t really find it to be a problem we only needed it as a base and somewhere to sleep as we were out most of the day so i would recommend this hotel to those with a similar situation if you are going to be spending more time in the room however it might be worth spending a bit extra and finding a bigger hotel we will definitely use this hotel again when in london
