we loved our charming room on the top floor which had a splendid view over paris we could sit on chairs to admire the view it was much bigger than i expected other comments let me think that the room would be small but it was not in comparison with parisian standards the staff was very nice and helpful i was very happy because we got exactly the room i asked for the breakfast was also much better than expected internet was included in the room
