the bed was fantastic the staff were super friendly check in and out was a breeze we were able to walk to the louvre and the musee d orsay within minutes train and bus stops were within minutes get the day passes for the public transportation system great shops and tons of cafe s were everywhere you looked super safe area my wife and i would wander the streets at with expensive camera gear and never felt at risk directly behind the hotel is a church built hundreds of years ago and is immaculate basically i can t imagine a better location to book a hotel in paris
