my husband and i spent days in london and paris for our anniversary what a delight to spend our paris leg in hotel pont royal the location could not have been better within walking distance to the louvre museum d orsay notre dame and even the eiffel tower about a min stroll the room was pretty spacious and well appointed with bath robes a hair dryer slippers and well stocked mini bar that we didn t touch spend your money at the cafe s the bed and pillows were comfortable and we welcomed having a bathtub in the spacious bathroom to soak our aching bodies after days of walking around both london and paris there are a plethora of non touristy cafe s in the area and supermarket across the street if you want to save some cash and eat in the best part is the staff unfailingly helpful and friendly from check in to check out we felt like we lucked out stumbling onto this hotel and we would certainly recommend it to anyone traveling to paris it really was a top notch experience
