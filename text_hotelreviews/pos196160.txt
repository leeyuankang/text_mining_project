we had a great two nights stay in a room large and comfortable enough for three high demanding women the bathroom was spacious with luxurious toiletries and fluffy towels and bathrobes we didn t have breakfast in the hotel but there are a lot of breakfast spots in the neighborhood very close to canal st martin and le marais so there is always something to do around and the r publique metro station with a lot of subway lines coming through this hub is only a few minutes away the staff was very welcoming friendly and always willing to help and the glass of champagne on the house as a welcome offer is a nice extra
