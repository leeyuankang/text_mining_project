the location was just outside le marais with all major attractions within a short taxi or minute walk hotel was on a quiet side street the lobby was stylish and comfortable the staff was helpful friendly and courteous they gave us a glass of champagne upon arrival a phone to use while in paris and the people at the desk were helpful with travel tips for the family all of which made for an authentic experience the family room was a home run with plenty of room for four clean and quiet typically we would have needed two rooms but this was a great value ask for
