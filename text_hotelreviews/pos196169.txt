brilliant location very close to oberkampf and republique metro stations and the bustling place de republique lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby and a couple of nice boulangeries too also it s in easy walking distance of the musee picasso in the interesting marais area the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful the beds were really comfortable a nice change from the hard beds that so many hotels offer nowadays the free soft drinks in the bar and the fitness centre in the basement were nice bonuses too
