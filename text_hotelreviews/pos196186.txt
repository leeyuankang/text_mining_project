the service is great we were given a welcome drink and the receptionist explained everything about the hotel and told us about the local area recommending restaurants the rooms were very stylish we ended up with double rooms instead of a triple and a double they all have great design features and good lighting we had both a bath and a balcony in our room the balcony looked out onto a typically parisienne scene which was delightful the hotel staff are really accommodating available whenever needed but leaving us in peace the rest of the time the hotel is really well decorated throughout and has a great selection of design and art books in the lobby we could ve happily spent an evening there studying them and drinking they have a beautiful collection of louis vuitton city guides that i had never seen before the facilities are impressive mineral water and pods for the nespresso machine were readily available and the fitness room and sauna are fantastic the sauna is kept at a good temperature at all times and was quiet everywhere including the sauna and gym was spotless the area that the hotel is situated in has lots of lovely little bars and restaurants on back streets it seems quite bohemian in places there are health food shops and an amazing gluten free bakers within ten minutes walk from the hotel it s not far from the pompidou centre and on the walk there you can find lovely shops specialising in anything from high fashion to cacti it s a great area to wander around shopping stopping to sit and watch the people go by every now and then at a cafe bar i will definitely go back to le general we had a fantastic couple of nights there and wished we could stay longer
