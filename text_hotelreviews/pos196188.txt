big room for paris standards clean everthing a traveller would need complimentary things like toothbrush and toothpaste comb etc nespresso machine and lovely tea bags comfy bed and modern decor we had asked for a quiet room and this is what we got the surprise of a samsung mobile phone for internet connection and international calls we were invited to take it with us on our city expeditions very useful cozy tables and chairs downstairs complimentary drink on arrival at the bar and bottled water in the room overall an excellent place close to republique within minutes walk to the station boulangerie utopie close by an absolute must we will definitely return to paris and will try to stay at le general for our next trip
