this is quite a trendy hotel which has been recently renovated so we were told by the neighbours amelia at reception always jumped up at our service and the rest of the staff were polite and amiable our room was in order including the baby cot we asked for and clean and everything worked the place is right next to place de la republique so within walking distance of some restaurants and very easy access to the metro tip if you like us are traveling with lots of big suitcases book an uber to take you to the hotel they are quick friendly and cheaper than the local taxis tip there is a little red shack on the place which organizes games and puts out loads of toys on wednesday afternoons for adults and kids to play and amuse themselves i think at a small fee there is also a skate ramp there which makes for some very spectacular and disastrous viewing of skaters company
