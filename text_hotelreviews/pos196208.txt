if carlsberg did hotels this would be pretty close to the blueprint it is a fantastic hotel and a steal at the price the location is in a nice suburb of paris not too far from notre dame the girl on reception was extremely helpful friendly and her english was perfect each room was equipped with a temporary mobile phone to be used during your stay with unlimited this was a god send and saved a fortune in data roaming charges i would stay here again in a heartbeat
