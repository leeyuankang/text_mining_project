the staff was so nice and very helpful with everything i loved that we had nespresso in the room the giant tv white high gloss finishes and the honor bar was great too the design of the lobby was also very cool i could tell that they tried very hard to make the hotel hip and added great details and design elements sort of an ace hotel feel
