the hotel is a quirky boutique hotel with very friendly staff the location is excellent and is close to the metro and many bars and pubs the rooms were a bit small but good enough for people the man who opened the door for us in the early hours of the morning was very friendly and helpful if we needed anything cant comment on the food because we didnt eat at the hotel
