good location as the metro is very close by there are plenty of restaurants and caf s around the hotel itself is located in a quiet street just off the main road has lifts so you don t have to drag heavy luggage up the stairs the staff was very friendly welcoming and helpful the room was perfect for a two night stay a bit small but it wasn t a problem for me but very clean and also had a little coffee machine and kettle for tea hour reception desk was a saver as i had to check out very early in the morning overall a very enjoyable stay
