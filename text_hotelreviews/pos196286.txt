beautiful decor throughout the hotel and the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful afternoon tea was a great touch never seen this in any other hotel great location just a minute walk from the seine very nice traditional french all you can eat breakfast with plenty of choice freshly made coffee and plenty of it unlike some other reviews we didn t experience any noise from the street however our room was on the fifth floor and it was winter so we didn t have the windows open maybe it s different in summer on lower floors
