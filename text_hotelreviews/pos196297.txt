my second stay at hotel therese and just as good as the first great location five minutes from the louvre but tucked away in the back street so really quiet lovely staff and clean comfy rooms didn t have time for breakfast this stay but previously was very good go early to avoid the crowds also free tea coffee snacks in afternoon everyday in the lobby
