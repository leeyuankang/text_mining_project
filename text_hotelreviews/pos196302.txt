truly lovely boutique hotel in a wonderful location with fantastic staff i would heartily recommend staying here if you re a person who is looking for a nicer small hotel it is appropriately priced for sure if i had to think of a population for which it is not suited i perhaps would not recommend it for a young family or at least not a family with more than one child nor to a person who prefers to stay at much larger chain hotels meaning they expect certain standard amenities presented in a certain standard way that s not a bad thing but it s important to know what you want my husband and i are people who like to travel want to enjoy a location s unique surroundings and vastly prefer a well appointed luxurious but not over the top boutique hotel or inn if that s also you i say don t hesitate to book some points to note rooms are small sure but the size is precisely what one would or should expect from a hotel in paris or almost any large city particularly at this price point beds are firm but very comfortable and well outfitted bathroom size is quite generous in my opinion especially for paris breakfast is available for purchase though i can t comment on it as we always went out complimentary tea time coffee tea snack is offered every afternoon ice water with lemon or mint and fresh apples are available all day there is a computer and printer available for your use at all hours located just off the larger of two sitting rooms connected to the lobby the complimentary wifi is very good and reliable throughout the building staff is present and ready to help at the front desk at all hours rarely only one person often more than two
