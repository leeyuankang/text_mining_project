the hotel is in a nice location on a quiet street rooms were clean and fairly comfortable the lobby area is nice and inviting with complementary tea and snacks in the afternoon the staff was very nice and accommodating the only two complaints are the rooms are tiny and the air conditioner wasn t working well so we got uncomfortably hot in the middle of the night
