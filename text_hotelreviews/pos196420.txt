we loved the room with a terrace and a view over parisian rooftops and a glimpse of the eiffel tower the bed was confortable and a large dressing the breakfast was good and nice in the veranda of the hotel location is great in a quiet street but right next to the fancy shops of passy and a convenient metro station
