staff were extremely helpful friendly the hotel is located in a very fashionable part of paris is easily accessible to some absolute icons of paris so many good qualities for this little gem make no mistake it is not a four seasons hotel it is best western it is a small hard working little hotel they try to do a good job i give them out of a for delivering the best they can with what they have to work with the dining area is pretty the buffet was well done the express breakfast was very good value the elevator is tiny but quite quick between floors ask for a lower floor if you don t want a long hike the decor in the lobby is timber which is lovely but makes the area dark but it s clean polished so looks impressive same goes for the rooms older style french decor it sits well with the overall ambiance
