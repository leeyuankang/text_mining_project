the hotel is new modern and with large rooms it also looked very clean good bathroom and shower quiet great value for london location might seem bad cause it s not a rich area but shadwell station is actually minutes away and gets you to central london very easily personally i had no trouble walking even alone at night and one time i walked from whitechapel station which is a bit further away
