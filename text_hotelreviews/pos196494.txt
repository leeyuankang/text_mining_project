the swipe access card to access the room worked instantaneously every time the lock system was more responsive than most places we stay so we were very impressed to not have to stuff around with the swipe access the breakfast had a good variety the room was nice and quiet the heating system worked super quietly and very efficiently there were many transport options and we even used the bike hire that was directly across the road it was within walking distance of many restaurants and pubs we had a great stay
