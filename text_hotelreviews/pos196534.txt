the hotel as a whole is a pleasant surprise for us the rooms and building is clean and bright star hotel level or even more the staff are always ready to help with patience in a sincere way super we booked the hotel before reviewing the comments was a bit worried after reading some comments on the location and safety concerns we did not do public transportation came back late in the evening sometimes we feel secured and comfortable with the area where the hotel locates
