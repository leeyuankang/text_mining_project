a free room upgrade our superior king room had the wow factor for us loved the hallway decor to the rooms floor our floor quite grand loved the ambience and decor of the restaurant and bar area this is one of the main reasons i wanted to stay here loved the air conditioning in rooms staff very polite and helpful at breakfast i felt for the staff they were rushing round trying to accommodate various requests from the guests because one member said they were members short well done to those who served us a pleasant stay
