mark at the reception desk was wonderful he made me feel very comfortable and answered any questions i had i loved the location it s a block away from green park station and a walk to hyde park tons of restaurants to choose from i highly recommend a french spot called le boudin blanc its only about a walk away and if you don t feel like walking at all the restaurant in the hotel has great selections as well ask razvan for wine recommendations with your meal
