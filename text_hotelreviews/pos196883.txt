the twin room was large and spacious there was ample wadrobe sapce shelving etc and room to put our suitcases teas and biscuits were a bit sparse so we had to ask for more the main bar and reception areas were a bit dated and uninspiring the hotel is just off green park so it is really central and perfect for shopping or sightseeing
