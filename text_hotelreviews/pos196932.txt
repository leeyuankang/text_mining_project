i was travelling with my young niece and we arrived at the hotel at about my niece was very tired from the long journey to london and the receptionist went out of her way to secure us an early check in excellent concierge service who are set up to look after your bags before and after check out full sky tv in the rooms and extensive room service menu the location is fantastic lovely minute walk through green park to buckingham palace then on to houses of parliament etc easy assess to hyde park and only a minute walk to the theatre district too lots of cafes nearby and a mini market over the road for essentials
