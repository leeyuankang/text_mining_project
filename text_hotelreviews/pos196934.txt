the staff were great the location was superb for me as my business dinner was around the corner it would be great for anyone wanting to be in the heart of the west end and great value some of the facilities seemed a little tired but the bed was very comfortable the bar is great for a drink and when i was last at the madison its restaurant it was a good place to eat not on this my first stay as a guest
