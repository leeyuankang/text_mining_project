fabulous hotel staff brilliant very pro active and would go the extra mile to make our experience a lovely weekend richard was fantastic and very knowledgeable about the local area and the transport he even supported us with transportation from the hotel to kings across to save us having to carry a case on the underground only one minor issue the evening meal menu was limited only one vegetarian hot meal on offer which then meant having to find alternative restaurant for the second night
