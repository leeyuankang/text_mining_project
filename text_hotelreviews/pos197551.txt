we stayed here as part of my girlfriend s birthday and you notice how beautiful the hotel is as soon as you walk in we mentioned in passing to the staff that it was my girlfriend s birthday and as we came back later that day to the room the staff had left a birthday card and cake with a happy birthday message written in chocolate sauce on the plate which was a great surprise the rooms are veey spacious with a big bathroom and an incredibly comfortable bed we also used the spa facilities and we had a massage which was amazing and they really made every effort to go the extra mile the breakfast views are incredible and the food was even better throughout our stay the staff were amazing and accommodating and i couldn t recommend this hotel any more
