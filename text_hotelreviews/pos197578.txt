all the staff at the radisson blu are warm friendly we were upgraded which was wonderful the room had a view of the thames and the bed was extremely comfortable we loved that there are voiles and curtains at the windows for privacy and to block out the light the room had a separate shower and a bath which you don t always get it is the perfect stay for visiting the
