the bed was extra comfy the bathroom amenities were excellent the room was very spacious and felt at home i m originally from london but he hotels location is perfect for someone who is not from the area it is in a secluded area away from traffic and the busy city but is easy to locate and travel to anywhere the staff were amazing and very helpful and the fact that the whole west ham team were staying there was a bonus and the staff did there best to help me get my birthday dream of meeting them overall my stay was amazing and will definitely be planning my next trip very very soon
