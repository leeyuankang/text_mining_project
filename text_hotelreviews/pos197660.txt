bed was very comfortable room was also quiet other hotels are often not so good reception staff were very helpful and friendly liked the availability of car parking at the hotel but valet parking wasn t so efficient when we were heading home see what could have been better we stayed at the hotel because we were going to the hotel is very convenient for quick transport link to via dlr and jubilee line
