stayed here as part of our anniversary getaway i had emailed someone a few days before we arrived to arrange something for our room everything went to plan but quickly went wrong when we got there overall lovely hotel with a great view from the bedroom and bathroom great location east india is less than a minute walk away and one stop from canning town where you can get the jubilee line breakfast was fine as it was included wouldn t pay for it otherwise staff were very unorganised and no one seemed to know what was going on easy to get to great location for view from our room was as described hotel was lovely
