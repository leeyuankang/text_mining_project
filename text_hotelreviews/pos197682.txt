i was just very impressed with the hotel overall we paid a good price and it really was worth it lovely staff there was a complimentary spa included with our stay which we didn t know about until we got there unfortunately the concierge was more than happy to give us advice about the best ways to get about and considering we went the night of a busy concert in the i thought the price was very good
