the staff was amazing they couldn t do enough for you make sure you don t miss the breakfast it s soo tasty it s untrue i can t wait to come back again the riverview room is definitely worth upgrading to the room and the view were second to none shuttle bus service was really handy although the tube is only a minutes walk away anyway one evening we was going to see a show in the west end whilst waiting for a taxi in the lobby we noticed a complimentary sweet cart near reception that was a nice touch we had a little goodie bag for the show for free
