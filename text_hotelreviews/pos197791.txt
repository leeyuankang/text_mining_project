the staff and facilities were great to a person every member of staff could not have been more helpful during my stay it had the vibe of an independent boutique hotel with a friendly welcoming vibe but backed up with the facilities afforded in a high end chain comfortable well appointed rooms and a great breakfast in the restaurant before i left for my meeting in the morning
