i stayed here for nights when doing ride london there were a number of cyclists staying at the hotel and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly they allowed me to keep my bike in the bedroom and put out breakfast on sunday from instead of the normal time the breakfast was excellent and we also ate in the restaurant on sunday evening and that was very good and not overly expensive the room was comfortable and well sound proofed the hotel was very convenient for both excel and the olympic park so definitely recommended for anyone doing ride london in the future as well as anyone wanting to stay near canary wharf
