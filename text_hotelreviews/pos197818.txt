the candy bar and fresh fruit throughout the day was a nice treat the room size was on par with anything you d find in a comparable price range in the us and the bathroom was very clean modern and spacious concierge services were very professional and helpful when i realized that i had to be to the airport before the nearest tube station even started running i paid comparable rates for far lesser accommodations at different times during my trips in out of london over a week period
