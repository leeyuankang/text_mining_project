like everything about this hotel have stayed here a few times in last yrs location for is perfect on my most recent stay my old son and myself stayed to attend some boxing on checking in i just mentioned that it had been my sons birthday earlier in the week and on returning the hotel had left a card and a tray of mini cakes in our room my son was bowled over by the thoughtfulness he also received a free breakfast in the morning as our stay was a birthday treat the hotel made our stay just that extra bit special many thanks
