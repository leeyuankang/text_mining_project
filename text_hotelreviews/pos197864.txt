the hotel has fantastic customer service which we received from guest services our room was amazing with great views and the little touches like the turn down service and receiving strawberries dipped in chocolates and a personalised note breakfast room service was served on a trolley with a heated compartment that converted into a breakfast table with flowers it was fantastic we can t wait to return
