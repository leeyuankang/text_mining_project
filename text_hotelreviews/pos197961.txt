me and my girlfriend stayed overnight for her birthday recently and where absolutely amazed by this place it has a very subtle yet stylish decor it s location means it s on the doorstep of all the important local venues and points of interest yet it s set on its very own corner of the river the staff where amazing as i had a few request for my girlfriends birthday and they more then came through we both where very impressed and are already planning our next visit
