this hotel is really great value for money the facilities size of room and views are brilliant compared to what you get for the same price in central london we were delighted with the service we went for our anniversary and upon arrival found we had been bumped up the penthouse for free they had also left us chocolate covered strawberries and a card lovely personal touches which absolutely made our day the restaurant downstairs has great views and the food is pretty good the spa is v relaxing
