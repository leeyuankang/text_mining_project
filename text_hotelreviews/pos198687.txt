i stayed as part of a family group for one night prior to my son s wedding we asked if the rooms we had reserved could be close together on the same floor and you arranged it thank you unfortunately none of the rooms were ready when we arrived despite having been told they would be available from when i rang in advance to ask and mine was the last to be ready and not until about that apart the proximity of rooms was excellent very comfortable beds
