it was a good location for the shard and for southbank which was our main purpose for our trip so location from that perspective was perfect for us but we would look elsewhere for our next trip to london purely down to the location only being good for those attractions in my opinion we didn t use any of the amenities in the hotel check in and out was pleasant enough the room was an average size but the bathroom was lovely and big its nice to have a bath with option of a shower could probably fit a stand alone shower in that bathroom which would be good as opposed to shower over the bath
