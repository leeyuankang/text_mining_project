the hotel is situated in our favourite part of london near london bridge and is close to the underground giving great access to all the main attractions of london the rooms are very spacious very modern and very clean the beds are very comfortable and you get a great nights sleep we stayed in an executive bedroom and therefore had free access to the executive lounge where my wife and i enjoyed a couple of drinks after dinner on the terrace overlooking the shard a very nice way to finish off my birthday with my wife
