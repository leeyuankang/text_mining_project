i have recently returned from a night stay at the hilton hotel london tower bridge the hotel location is great a short walk from the tower bridge there was lot s going on around and we enjoyed a nice stroll down to the river side in the evening there is a great choice of restaurants close by the hotel was very clean with a nice modern feel the rooms are very comfy and we got a good nights sleep staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble we paid extra and had breakfast i m glad we did and it was well worth the money there was lot s of choice everything was freshly prepared and we were able to sit outside due to the nice weather i would definitely stay here again
