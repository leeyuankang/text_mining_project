excellent customer service and focus throughout the stay even on a tough weekend for people after the eu referendum vote all staff were welcoming and observant and offered real attention to detail for instance it was my partner s birthday and i had mentioned when asked that i couldn t say what we were doing for the weekend as it was a surprise low and behold the next day we return from visiting events to a complimentary cake desert in our room and warm wishes these are the types of things that set certain hotels apart nothing was too much trouble and we really enjoyed our stay thank you
