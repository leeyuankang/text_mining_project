the breakfast was fantastic lovely produce including the sausage and bacon staff were very friendly on arrival and staff welcoming us to breakfast we arrived earlier than check in but our room was ready for us the room was great it was clean spacious and comfortable the hotel is in a fantastic location right near the tube station and right near the bridge which was great for our trip to the london tower would definitely recommend this hotel to others and will be definitely staying here again
