fantastic location and so accessible from london bridge station very short walk to the borough market tower bridge st kathirines dock and a lovely oat ride takes just a few minutes on the water to the globe or a bit further to the southbank we were with friends for a birthday surprise philip at reception ensured that a beautiful plate of chocolate goodies awaited us in our room little touches like this merely serve to emphasise what a great level of care we had from all the staff
