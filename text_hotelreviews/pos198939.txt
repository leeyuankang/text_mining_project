the staff were absolutely fantastic they couldn t do enough for you and made our stay really special the executive lounge was being refurbished too so they used a couple of meeting rooms which did get a bit overcrowded but the free flowing drinks were great we celebrated my partners birthday and this was great because the staff made him feel really special and made lots of effort
