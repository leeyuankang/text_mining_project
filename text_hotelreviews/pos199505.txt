everything was perfect actually it is quite far from central london but the hotel is sooo close to tube station so it doesn t matter and there are market coffee shop as well and room was really clean wide and cozy also they were really kind people honestly i kept my wallet in safe and i knew it after checking out they collected it for three days it was my fault and i tried to call them to make sure it so it might take their time but they were really kind when i arrived there to turn back it even they are soooo kind breakfast is also good point in here you can eat all fresh and delicious british breakfast in the morning
