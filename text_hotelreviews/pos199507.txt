fabulous comfy bed good pillows and lightweight duvet modern bathroom with complimentary shampoo bath stuff etc secure quiet bedroom no noise from the corridors or neighbouring rooms good temperature control coffee and tea supplies provided excellent breakfast choice kept well topped up despite two large tour parties descending en masse at the same time causing seating issues and being rather demanding on some of the staff minutes walk from the tube station
