the hotel was modern and clean the bar area was ok but nothing special staff were really friendly and helpful the area around the hotel is going through major redevelopment and is going to be very impressive we didn t eat at the hotel as we were in the hospitality at wembley stadium drinks at the bar were very reasonable for a london hotel and the bar staff were really good
