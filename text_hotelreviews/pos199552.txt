the room was very well furnished clean new and i really liked the armchair and footstool it made a nice change to lying on the bed and made the room much more relaxing usually hotel rooms at this price only have a bed and a desk and basic chair so it was a real plus i also liked the fact that you could open the windows and let fresh air in
