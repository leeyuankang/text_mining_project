the location to wembley stadium was excellent the hotel was spacious and airy and the rooms looked to have been recently refurbished to a high standard with a lovely contemporary feel staff were very polite and helpful and most of all cheery breakfast was very good too with a wide choice system for breakfast worked very well with no queues would not hesitate to use again and would certainly recommend
