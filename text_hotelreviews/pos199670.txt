amazing stay especially if you there for matchday at wembley went for barcelona vs liverpool and with people around the hotel access was not an issue after the match we managed to get back to the hotel within mins we received a room near a lift and the gym with a great view of the stadium for a sporting experience this hotel is value for money and a must walking distance from food and shopping
