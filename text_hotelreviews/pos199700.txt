the location of the hotel was perfect a calm area with good surroundings a near by supermarket which is open till late hours and another bigger supermarket which is open till pm a shopping mall is so close to it too there are many restaurants in less than minutes walk just infront of the hotel and many of these restaurants provide halal food which is a very big advantage in this area many other small supermarkets are close too from which you can get sim cards for mobile phones and top up your credits moreover wimbley park underground station is about minutes on foot and you can reach centre of london in about minutes by the underground the tube the room size was really good compared with other hotels in london with tea facilities and minibar the room service was really great with good cleaning daily there is also a restaurant inside the hotel but we didn t try it
