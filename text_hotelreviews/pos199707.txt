location is excellent if you going to wembley staff are friendly and welcoming wifi is included which is great a call to housekeeping to replenish toiletries and there within mins so that s great service bathroom fitments are good quality don t feel like they are going to break easily like some hotels the hotel is very quiet in the evening even though there s a hustle bustle outside modern and comfortable interior with great hanging space in room
