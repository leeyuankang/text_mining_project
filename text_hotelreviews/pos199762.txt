the hotel is about as perfectly located for wembley as you can get wembley park underground station is a minute walk away wembley is minutes away and there s a lidl mcdonalds across the street in case you need supplies the room itself was excellent really liked the space the power shower and the bed plenty of storage a window you were allowed to open a rarity these days and air con that actually worked and fast parking was day but well worth it considering the cost of other options no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you re visiting wembley particularly if you re driving
