great location for concerts and stadium events and good transport links for central london tourist attractions nice clean rooms with a lovely bathroom and toiletries are restocked everyday if you use them staff are very friendly and committed to making your stay as pleasant as possible always plenty of people around if you need anyone even late at night breakfast was lovely and was included in our room rate but we would have happily paid the extra had we decided not to have it included when we originally booked there were lots of continental options and cooked options were kept warm and very tasty lots of fruit juices everything was restocked quickly when it was beginning to run low there was an event on at the stadium one day and the street outside the hotel got very busy the front of the hotel and its outside benches were fenced off with bouncers supervising the gate although there didn t seem to be any trouble it was nice to know that they were there just in case
