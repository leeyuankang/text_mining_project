i love the breakfast free daily papers being close to sainsbury s wembley park shopping center and wembley park underground station which has both jubilee line and the metropolitan line but you should also keep in mind that getting to the city center takes app to minutes by tube the day we hung dnd on the door the housekeeping lady sent a letter to our room and offered to clean the room in the evening that was also nice and thoughtful the hotel is brand new and very clean
