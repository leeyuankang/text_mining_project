it is located right next to both wembley stadium and wembley arena perfect for our stay and right next to wembley park tube station for easy access there are some nice shops and restaurants within a few minutes walk the accommodation was luxurious we did have an executive suite though and the stay was so comfortable and easy great views at night from the floor
