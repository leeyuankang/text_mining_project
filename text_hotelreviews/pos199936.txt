i loved the hotel room clean and spacious the staff are very friendly i got upgraded to a queen suite which was amazing with a kitchen and a seperate full sofa bed this hotel is perfectly located at the underground station at wembley park and close to food and the london designer outlet you don t really need a car there overall the hotel was helpful with anything i needed and was amazing
