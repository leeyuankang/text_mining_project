a pleasant little hotel conveniently located not far from a main line metro station porte maillot excellent restaurants and the bois de boulogne the room was not huge but very comfortable and clean staff were friendly and helpful with one minor exception see below the hotel has spa facilities but we did not use these so cannot comment on them we enjoyed our stay there on the whole
