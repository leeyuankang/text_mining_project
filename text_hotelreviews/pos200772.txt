i would like to talk with travellers with head on their shoulders and feet really on the floor there are so many hotels in paris but when you exclude the very expensive ones the big chains hotels not very exciting the bad ones then you have the good hotels good location reasonable price small good service we find one in paris les jardins de la villa spa everything perfect starting with the manager stephane une perle rare the receptionist nicolas he knows his job and he is doing it perfectly and all the remaining staff the decoration of the hotel itself and the rooms particularly is amazing breakfast is very good and served in a very different manner than other hotels it s really the place to be in paris mainly due to the location the calm little street proximity of main center of paris very good restaurants around room was a very good choice but i guess all numbers will satisfy the most difficult go there it s a very good choice
