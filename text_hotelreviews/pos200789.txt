the staff at les jardins were exceptional very welcoming professional and helpful they went above and beyond to facilitate any requests i had and were probably the best hotel staff i ve ever dealt with upon checking in early they made it a priority to make sure my room was cleaned next so i could have the key to it asap the hotel is very clean has excellent facilities and is in a great location i really enjoyed my stay here and thoroughly recommend it to others
