the decor of this beautiful hotel isn t given justice by the photographs lovely little touches wherever you look the finish is of high standard throughout our room was a nice size i had been expecting small the bed was wonderfully comfortable and huge the shower room amazing never been in such a huge shower all in the room could not be faulted the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful location good and in an area of upmarket shops easy access from metro breakfast was nice more than just croissants fruit salad and yoghurt eggs and bacon would love to visit again hope i get the opportunity
