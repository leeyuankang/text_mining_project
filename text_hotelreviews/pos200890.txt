location location location first it is right off the famous champs elysee i e a minute away and a few steps to george v metro station which is directly connected to the bigger charles de gaule station which has the rer it is also close to a lot of very good restaurants and cafes including the famous georges v with its tasty hot chocolate and desserts and shopping centers as monoprix zara h and m sephora and great brands as kenzo and louis vuitton the room size was good for a family of we took the executive room that had a queen sized bed that was comfortable in addition to a double sized sofa bed that can accomodate we were shown the junior suite which was bigger and had on top a small dinning table but it turned out to be a euros more expensive per night and frankly did not think it was worth it especially since we were not planning to eat in the room the heating system worked very well which was a blessing since the temperature was around c i e it was freezing the room had a very good sized closet an easy to use safe and a small fridge it had also a writing table and a chair and enough space for the lauggage the bathroom though was a little impractical since the toilette was in a separate room than the washing basin and the bathtub but the size was great and spacy and the magnifiying mirror was well located something of prime importance to me and my daughters to apply makeup easily the room lighting was good though it could be made better since you need to put each light on or off separately there was a little issue with the electricity sockets which were in impractical places and we had to go down to plug our phone chargers and i believe they should have been placed in a higher locations to give people easier access also i realized unfortunately too late that the plugs located near the room entrance will shut down once the main corridor lamp is turned off i
