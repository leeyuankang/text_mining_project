honestly everything was perfect except the service attitude of receptionist a lady is very bad impatient and rude for instance i called reception she didn t wait for i finished talking just closed the phone which was really shocked me when i came down for asking some question and check out she was super impatient and bad attitude well i m a student from hospitality and as the knowledge i ve got from school should not be like this such a good hotel with this bad staff i had very bad impression about that hopefully she could improve the service attitude trying to be nicer to the guest because the guests deserve basic respect since we paid much money
