breakfast was very good and a lovely treat served up to our room why on earth would you go downstairs for breakfast when you could eat it on your own private sunny balcony the room was a good size very clean and all the amenities were what one would wish for on the first night we ate in the warwick s a la carte restaurant the food was delicious and the service was excellent thoroughly recommend it as it was one of the finest meals we ate in paris that weekend s
