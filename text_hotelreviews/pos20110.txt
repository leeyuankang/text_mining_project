staff understand the meaning of customer service everyone was friendly and accommodating i never heard noise or anything disruptive the bathroom floor tiles were heated room service is minibar is complimentary i was there a few days before my birthday and without prompting they left a nice plate of chocolates and candied desserts with a happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate all the little things added up to make it an excellent stay and a fantastic hotel
