the hotel is lovely pleasant and helpful staff really liked the fact that you have a smartphone to use during the duration of your stay came in handy while finding our way walking around london the hotel room was nice and the bed was really comfortable i cant remember the last time i slept so well during my travels last but not least location location location everything you need is minutes away
