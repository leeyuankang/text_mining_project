very handy location to paddington station and heathrow express and in the pretty paddington area this hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated the staff are wonderful thank you and the english breakfast was excellent not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh good indian and european cuisine
