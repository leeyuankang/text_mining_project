we stayed at the ampersand hotel kensington on the eve of our wedding and our wedding night the staff were so friendly and helpful especially miguel who showed us to our room and helped with our bags the hotel itself was clean and as described on their website we were not disappointed with our room which was a compact but functional suite on the floor the room had a well stocked complimentary mini bar robe slippers tv s etc and even our own secure wifi bubble it also had a balcony over looking harrington road which was nice the little extras that the hotel staff arranged were so thoughtful i received a little postcard an hour after we arrived wishing me a happy stay and wonderful day accompanied by a small box of tasty sweet treats on our arrival back at the hotel after our wedding celebrations there was a plate in our room with happy wedding written on it in chocolate and more sweet treats it was such a lovely touch we would not hesitate to recommend the ampersand hotel and will definitely be back for our anniversary
