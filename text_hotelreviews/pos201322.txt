hotel was lovely very clean and lovely helpful staff easy to visit sites from this is a quite hotel no bar although you can order a drink and tea coffee available at a charge breakfast continental not a lot of choice though room was very spacious with matching decor and spotless the only fault with room was only mirror in bathroom and no long mirror no good when you have two women fighting for mirror ha would definitely stay here again
