we spent the weekend walking all over paris and the hotel was perfectly situated from our perspective walk from the louvre and about to montmartre on foot lots of fantastic restaurants in the vicinity and we found one called l epouvantail which we could not recommend highly enough about walk from the hotel near place des voges the hotel itself was small but very well presented our room overlooked the central courtyard and was extremely quiet and we slept very well we also loved the fact that it was close to the canal which meant we could go running first thing before breakfast which was a continental affair only but with very good produce we loved it
