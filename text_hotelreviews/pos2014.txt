the room was small but we knew that before arrival i just didn t think that paying an extra for a room that i wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it the wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it the hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair parking was a nightmare as you have to park minutes away and trudge back with your luggage this wasn t mentioned before booking i wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under waitrose and was for two night the price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage the location was good close to paddington and lancaster gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab
