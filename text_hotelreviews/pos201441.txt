because our first room had an issue with the shower drain which caused the bathroom to flood we were upgraded to a suite the staff was very helpful and accommodating the suite was quaint roomy and had a lovely small balcony window on the roof bed was comfy bathroom large and clean the location was great one block off the champ elysees and the fdr roundabout close to metro station cafes and to a bench on the roundabout with a partial view of the eiffel tower
