the reception staff were welcoming and our room was a good standard double clean and extremely quiet this hotel is down a nice small side street not well represented on google satellite so don t let that put you off directly off a main road which has some lovely cafes and only minutes from a metro station central for all our needs the breakfast was really good hot bacon and eggs fresh fruit and different cakes each morning well worth the money
