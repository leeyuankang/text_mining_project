great location near marais two metro lines and oberkampf restaurants in an authentic part of paris free of large scale tourism extremely quiet well equipped rooms on internal courtyard although rooms are small and hotel lacks some features of a true four star hotel rooms are great value whenever available at the price of a two or three star hotel strongly recommended to persons who prefer the elegance of the past to the shiny brand new look of an airport hotel
