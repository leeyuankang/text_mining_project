i stayed in a lot of hotels in paris for years now but this is one of the best actually all i need is a good bed and a shower in a clean and quiet room for a normal price eur this means i stayed only a few times in le marais since the hotels are extremely expensive this time booking com had an offer i could not refuse and i loved it what a wonderful hotel highly recommended i hope i will be able to stay again
