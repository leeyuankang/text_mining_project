villa beaumarchais is a fine hotel in a world of aseptic business hotels it manages to bring some charme to your stay in paris even though it would require some renovation the structure feels parisienne and has a classical touch that works well so if you are for modern hotels this is not the place for you my superior room was big for paris standards and the bathroom was very spacious and well equipped i even had a nice bathtub nice complimentary services such as a nespresso like machine with free coffee capsules it is located in the marais which is a great spot to be in lots of nice bars restaurants and boutiques staff was extremely friendly and managed well and professionally a big disservice the first night they had to relocate me to a different close by hotel because they realized they didn t have a room for me while this was quite upsetting they indulged in taking care of my case and offered an upgrade and a few other benefits for the remaining days of my stay
