the location was great but our check in was a bit chaotic we ended up needing to move rooms and they upgraded us which was really nice but the front desk was not very responsive i ended up having to walk back downstairs after we waited minutes for someone to bring us the new key the breakfast was also terrific and well worth the price also the hotel was quiet and tucked away which i also really liked
