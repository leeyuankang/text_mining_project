it was our trip to paris and this is the best place we have stayed in the staff were exceptional and helped us in any way they could on arrival we were shown to our room which smelt of cigarette smoke and when we spoke to the receptionist she agreed and moved us to another room no questions asked there is air conditioning and a fridge which is a great thing to have if we go back to paris we will stay here again oh and they looked after my bicycle as well
