had a boutique hotel feel rather than part of a large anonymous chain and a very nice bar breakfast area breakfast was a good selection for the reasonable price staff very attentive and helpful location was very convenient about walk into the centre of the marais district and the place de vosge and close to a number of restaurants cannot comment on the evening meal in room service because we did not use it
