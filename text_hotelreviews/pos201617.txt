it is right off of a main street near two large metro lines two minute walk to one and five minute walk or less to another but it is tucked away on a small quiet side street it is a ten minute walk or two stops from the closest station to the bastille where you can take the metro basically anywhere the staff was very friendly and accommodating the building is well kept for an old historical building and decorated beautifully there are lots of good restaurants in the area
