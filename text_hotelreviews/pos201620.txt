good location close to metros and in a thriving historic and creative district lots of small bistros specialist shops boutiques and galleries within five minutes walk with pleasant parks and gardens waiting to be discovered and prices are very reasonable for paris if you like exploring and wandering away from the usual tourist areas you will love le marais area staff at the hotel were always very cheery conversational and helpful and most speak very good english although do have a go at speaking french as it helps break the ice we can t comment on the food however as we never ate at the hotel preferring to skip breakfast and have an good lunch in a restaurant or bistro followed by a light dinner in the evening allied to all the walking that you inevitably do in paris this meant that not only did we have a great weeks holiday we actually lost weight bonus
