excellent location with easy bus connections recommended means of travel with a toddler and very quite neighborhood clean rooms with beautiful decor and comfortable beds very thoughtful hotel personnel they let us check in early set up a crib for our toddler even though we did not ask for it and removed it immediately when we clarified that we did not actually need one merci beaucoup definitely our favorite hotel in paris
