we arrived and got told we were upgraded our new room was massive and had a hot tub the staff were all friendly and spoke good english location wise it was just off a busy street however our room was nice and quiet as it overlooked a court yard the museums such as pompidou centre and louvre were walking distance with good transport links for montmartre and eiffel tower
