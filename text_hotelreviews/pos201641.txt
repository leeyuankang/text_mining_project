paris was in the grip of a very cold snap during my short stay when i arrived in my room i found out that the heating was not working i informed reception and they not only sent someone to check it immediately they offered me to change room or to bring me a powerful electric heater let s not forget profuse apologies and the kettle i had requested on booking form came with a large assortment of teas and biscuits on top i opted for the heater and my entire stay there was snug and warm also appreciated fast broadband and enjoyed the magazines newspapers left at guest disposal in the lobby and on every floor will definitely go back
