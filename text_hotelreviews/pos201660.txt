the bedroom was so peaceful and the windows opened out onto a quiet courtyard with green foliage climbing over the walls this was in stark contrast to the busy cosmopolitan buzz of the city it was fab to be so close to many great places in le marais and yet have a relaxing sanctuary to go back to all of the staff were polite welcoming and very helpful the breakfast was a great start to the day a large varied selection of buffet style together with a few hot items such as scrambled egg a good water pressure to the shower and piping hot water bliss best of all it felt like we were in a traditional parisian hotel loved it thank you
