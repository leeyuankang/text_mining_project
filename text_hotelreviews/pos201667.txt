the location is great and within easy walking distance to many fine places to eat and drink staff was very helpful friendly and accommodating the decor was a bit dated but we found it charming the bar downstairs was also nice and the bartender friendly and helpful we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and bath and we slept through the night and morning without troubles we will probably stay here the next time we are in town
