the staff from top to bottom is friendly helpful multilingual and welcoming the rooms on the floor are very quiet despite being in the center of paris and facing the street the location for touring many of the principal tourist sites is excellent you are a very short walk from the louvre palais royale comedie francaise place de la concorde jardins de tuilleries opera and just across the bridge from the musee d orsay there are three major metro stops nearby and a taxi stand on the corner this is a very comfortable smaller alternative to the much bigger chain hotels in the area like the westin or the much pricier ones like the ritz carlton a half a block away
