everything was quite fine with this hotel nothing to complain about the location is perfect this spot is a geometrical center of all sights of interest for tourists so you can easily reach all of them even by foot metro stations are also not far one drawback might be the lack of supermarkets in the neighbourhood so if you stronlgy need some during your stay this might be a problem the room i was in was relatively small but not smaller than it is usual in this kind of hotels in paris everything else was very good the room equipment is perfect cleanless is perfect and the breakfast is very good rich and of high wuality i especially liked the floor heating in the bathroom as well as the high quality of bathroom furniture equipment and showers all my recommendations except for the price that was rather high but still competitive to other similar hotels in paris
