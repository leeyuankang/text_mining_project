bed was very comfy just a tad small i booked a deluxe room and requested two singles as i was staying with my sister and request was met the decor cleanliness and set up was good very impressed overall toiletries were very generous and complimentary mini bar with soft drinks was a very nice touch staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble location was absolutely fantastic will comeback next year
