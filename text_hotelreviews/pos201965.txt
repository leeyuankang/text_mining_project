i stayed here with my dad for nights and i wouldn t recommend this area for first time visitors to paris the staff was very helpful with directions and other information needed but they seem to be either understaffed or have people who don t speak english at all because no one but the front desk pick up calls so you have to request all your house keeping and food information there they too sometimes don t pick up the rooms and bathrooms were well maintained and were very clean and tidy but are very small the location is good as the metro in a two minutes walk and there s a big bus stop near by too
