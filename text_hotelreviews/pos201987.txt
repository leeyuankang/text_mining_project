this is my stay at holiday inn gare de l est and i will continue to choose this hotel on my upcoming trips to paris the location is superb you are directly across from gare de l est so there is immediate access to the metro regional and high speed trains as well as bus lines gare du nord is within walking distance if you need to catch the eurostar gare de l est also has some shopping within the station and places to grab food if needed among which include two starbucks a market a book store a cafe one of the paris tourism offices and many souvenir kiosks if you need to buy gifts the staff in the hotel is always friendly welcoming and helpful as a native english speaker trying to learn french the staff is patient and polite as i sometimes struggle to communicate the hotel is very accommodating on many levels i typically request a specific room because i like the view and they always attempt to meet my request additionally if you have a late train or bus but need to meet the noon checkout time the hotel will gladly store your luggage until you are ready to depart the city or if you arrive early before check in the front desk is always quick to assist with maps and directions as needed and it appears many on staff are multi lingual the rooms are very clean modern and the hotel feels very secure the view from my floor room facing the train station was amazing with a gorgeous view at night of the illuminated sacre coeur the wifi is very good the showers are roomy with a rain head and a removable spray and have good pressure the room temp is adjustable although some may think the rooms are small by some standards i find them to be perfect the rooms are also very quiet the insulation must be very good i did not hear the street noises below when my windows were shut and locked
