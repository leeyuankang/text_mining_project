room well equipped and clean other reviews say rooms are small but i found the room no smaller than any other i have stayed in liked the modern decor metro outside door eurostar station within easy reach staff helpful breakfast seemed pricey but actually considering what was available and the fact it is unlimited it was around euros more than a croissant and hot drink available nearby hotel held luggage after checkout
