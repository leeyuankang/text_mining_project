the hotel was just as described the staff were all charming helpful and multilingual even after i messed up the in room safe twice in minutes breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice of good quality food the baguettes were especially good the area around the hotel has a large number of pleasant restaurants and bars within walking distance some are expensive others are not so something for everyone
