bed was comfortable with soft sheets and not too hard or thin pillows bathroom was very clean which is really important to me hotel was directly across from train station making in and out throughout paris easy no train noise we left our bags after checkout and were able to easily pick up just before getting on train out of paris i saw they also had an airport shuttle service but we didn t need it
