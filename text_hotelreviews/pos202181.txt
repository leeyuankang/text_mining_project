this hotel is situated directly across the road from gare de l est train station we had a front room with views of the train station which was surprisingly quiet minute walk from here to gare de nord with suitcases of stairs to negotiate on the way to catch train to airport metro accessible via gare de l est and train staff very helpful when purchasing tickets
