i left a hotel that i d booked online with another company because it was very uncomfortable nothing like what it looked like online and i found it dirty and unsafe i scrambled to find another hotel last minute and booked the holiday inn in paris wow it was amazing such a beautifully modern hotel friendly staff and an amazingly comfortable and clean room the room had a huge tv with tons of movie options a waterfall show and was spotless i was so impressed and immediately felt comfortable there i wish i could have stayed longer
