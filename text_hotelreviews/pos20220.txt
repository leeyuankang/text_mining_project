we drove to the hotel and paid the extra to park at the hotel s recommended carpark this was simple although i would suggest making sure you call the hotel minutes or so before arrival as the wardens waiting in the road along side the hotel are very quick to pounce the initial greet and at first sight the hotel is lovely a great location for people wanting to explore what london has to offer the tube station and kensington itself is only minutes walk and the natural history museum is also only minutes walk away the room size was good and very clean not much of a view but we had london to explore so not too worried about that
