great location for fi at time tourist to paris room was exceptionally small for us with my partner being and medium build we did what we call the paris shuffle around the room breakfast was very basic and ran out of things quickly quality of the food was a little hit miss staff were great and very helpful with information on tour busses and transport around the city i would recommend this as a great hotel for a single traveller
