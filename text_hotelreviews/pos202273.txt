we traveled as a young couple and we must say the hotel was very lovely the staff was very helpful and friendly and the room was clean and modern the train station is right in front of the hotel but it didn t bring any noise or other complains with it we stayed on the floor and had a beautiful view from our balcony the metro entrance is extremely close to the hotel so we could travel all over town and come back to our hotel in no time the wifi is working perfectly and the breakfast was really good we had al lovely stay and recommend this hotel to all our friends and family
