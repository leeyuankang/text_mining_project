i loved the comfort of my room and the super fast wi fi it was great to know that after a full day of tiring sight seeing i had a clean safe and comfy room to look forward to the heating was excellent and the bathroom was clean which is always a critical factor for me the staff at the hotel were very friendly putting in extra effort for example printing out tour tickets for me at reception a special mention to the kind man who took my baggage out of storage and still guarded it while i went to the bathroom these incidents may not seem important but it made a huge difference to me the location is okay i did not explore the nearby area much but it seemed lively and was within walking distance of place de la republique otherwise the stairs to the metro station gare de l est are literally outside the hotel entrance which makes it so convenient to get around overall i had a great stay and would definitely recommend this place
