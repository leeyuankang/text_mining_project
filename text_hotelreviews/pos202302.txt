perfect location right outside the gare de lest metro the staff maria was super nice and helped us check in early she is extremely courteous and went out of our way to make us comfortable the are is central to most locations and since it is at the doorstep to a metro station it is easy acess everywhere gare de lest has amazing stores and restarurants coffee shops for breakfast right at the station itself i had a lovely time the neighborhood is peaceful and calm the room was ideal for a couple
