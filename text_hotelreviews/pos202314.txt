located not far from main attractions such as notre damme etc mins walk or mins by metro about the same or shorter distance to montmartre can go from and to cdg airport by rer train just per person that arrives in gare du nord train station that s just a mins walk the hotel itself is modern and very clean inside rooms are relatively spacious by paris standards overall very good value for the money that we paid which was a temporary discount rate
