bed very comfortable rooms completely silent my duplex was unexpected and a lot of fun to have stairs in the room the staff are very helpful polite and discreet breakfast is excellent but pricey if you only want coffee and a croissant if it s included in your rate it s a bargain basically the hotel is big and smart enough to look after you properly but small enough to feel intimate and personal
