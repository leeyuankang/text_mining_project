this hotel was amazing it was my first trip away with my new partner and i wanted to make sure it was special the location is spot on minute walk from the eiffel tower and with uber being so cheap in paris the most expensive cab we got was to gare du nord generally it was between to get anywhere we had a duplex room which i would suggest to anybody the room has apple airplay compatability on both tvs so you can stream your own movies or music to the tv s a nespresso machine that is complimentary and a well stocked mini bar that s fairly priced for a paris hotel the staff were all fabulous and extremely attentive and we came away saying that the next time we re in paris we cannot stay anywhere but at le cinq codet it s of course more expensive than plenty of the other nice hotels around but i still think it s a bargain for the experience we had i scored huge brownie points with my new girlfriend and this place really impresses for a young couple this ticked every single box thank you so much
