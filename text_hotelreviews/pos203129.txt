i enjoyed my stay tremendously but i would like to point out that the staff were as impressive as the hotel and that is important as you can have a top hotel with poor staff and it ruins the whole experience i stayed in the duplex suite and it was simply magical the hotel goes above and beyond and i will be staying there again
