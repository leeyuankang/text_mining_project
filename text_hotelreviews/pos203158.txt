the hotel is rated star but it doesn t feel star at all it is like star hotel the staff is amazing but the hotel it self is expensive and is not worth that much deluxe rooms are very bad as it s very small and on two floors the shower was broken and after speaking to the manager he was able to upgrade our room but still the room was very small
