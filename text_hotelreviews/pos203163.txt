the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly the bed and pillows were super comfy we were given an upgrade to a superior room very quiet so we were able to get a rested nights sleep after a very active day the bathroom was a good size and had two sinks which was a nice touch metro was very close to the hotel so we were able to move around paris easily
