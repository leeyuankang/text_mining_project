lovely hotel near opera we walked down from gare du nord as it was a beautiful day and went through the old covered passageways verdeau jouffroy and panaramas which was an interesting stroll greeted at the hotel by stefano who immediately got us a drink and was very helpful with information we needed we had room which had a tiny courtyard seating area no view but a secluded place to sit and have a glass of wine didn t use the spa as we had lots of things booked and the heated pool wasn t needed when it was beautiful outside breakfast was good and had all usual things very close to metro station overall a very nice stay thank you
