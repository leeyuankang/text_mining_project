la madison favary is one of the nicest hotels i ve ever stayed i ve traveled abroad to many countries over many years i have stayed in the plaza hotel and the waldorf in new york city i would take the hotel favart over them both the staff is topnotch they truly treat you like family as soon as you walk into the door the decor is clean and modern and chic the breakfast was pricy but it was just enough for my daughters and i i plan to return whenever i can
