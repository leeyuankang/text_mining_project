loved the decor one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel the service was great friendly welcoming staff who did their best to please and to accommodate requests we had rooms on the floor and they had lovely high ceilings the breakfast is really good for a small hotel echire butter good jams cold cuts neatly cut and arranged good tea selection hot milk a different fresh tart each day all quite refined the complimentary tea coffee and tart in the afternoon was a real plus small details make the difference wifi is fast and no need to re sign in throughout the stay which is great
