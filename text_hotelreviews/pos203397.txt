gorgeous hotel near opera w stunning indoor pool and gym beautifully appointed and decent sized rooms we got a bedroom duplex petite maison fantastic breakfast and very kind and helpful staff location is just typical paris but close to metro lines and not too far walk from shopping air conditioned so really a gem interior and amenities high star would definitely recommend
