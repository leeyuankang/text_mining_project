location is amazing especially for paris first timers shoppers and museum lovers it s very central and you can walk all over paris from this location and i mean everywhere the toiletries from juliette has a gun is all sorts of amazing buy it if you can at the main store in malsherbes sorry if i misspelled tea from kusmi and nespresso were great but it s not in your room you have to go to the lounge design is great sheets are good and comfortable it was clean and cozy
