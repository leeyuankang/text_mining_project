we loved the location of le pradey it was so easy to walk everywhere we never took public transportation the staff was exceptional and very friendly the roads were blocked for a marathon and one of the staff was so nice to help roll our luggage to the nearest cross street to meet our taxi to the train station we will definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again on our next visit to paris
