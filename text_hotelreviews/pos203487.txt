amazing location in the heart of the louvre and close to so many restaurants including all the high end shopping we actually got an amazing price during the time we visited usually the price comes out to night canadian on other times bit we were able to get a standard bedroom for less then night canadian not included taxes and vat fees yet our hotel was super clean only downside is that it was small for people and i had no where to place my luggage as we had medium sized luggage the shower was a bit small as well when i turn my butt can touch the wall and the rain shower head was going everywhere and made the floors wet therefore i had to use the hand held shower instead to wash myself but then again this is still pretty good for europe size i come from canada where space in hotels are rather large and spacious and i understand europe size standards are different overall my experience in this hotel was excellent and the staff was so helpful especially one name dogan who helped me over email before my trip and even when i arrived oh and don t forget hot tea and coffee is free on the mezzanine level breakfast is extra charge but we never ate at the hotel restaurant since there were so many great places to eat surrounding our hotel
