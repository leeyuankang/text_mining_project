firm mattress really helped my dodgy back complaint room layout was good storage in the room was ok they had a complimentary mobile phone including both local and international calls for use throughout the stay allocated to your room at no additional cost the staff and particularly the gentlemen at the door were so welcoming and very helpful that would leave most hotels well behind
