we were greeted with a smile and a gentleman called cj took us to our room and explained how things worked and where everything was he arranged for an ironing board to be delivered and it arrived almost as soon as he left the room he was very helpful and friendly throughout our week long stay the location was perfect and we walked almost everywhere we wanted to get to we had breakfast in the restaurant which was delicious and spent time in the purple bar trying cocktails again the staff in the bar were really friendly our room was spacious and modern and was kept ultra clean the hotel is very central but we couldn t hear the traffic outside incredibly quiet so got a good nights sleep loved the pillows as well just right for me we will definitely be staying there again
