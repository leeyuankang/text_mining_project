someone has really taken the time to think about the little details with this hotel from the fragrance that hits you when you walk in that then links to the toiletries to the standard rooms feeling like suites i m very impressed the staff are warm and welcoming no matter who you are and the hotel design has been well put together we had a little service hiccup if you will while we were there and even that has been resolved swiftly and politely the staff have a genuine nature and really do seem to care about your stay and service which is something we really look for in hotel very happy customer
