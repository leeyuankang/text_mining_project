the staff were extremely friendly and very welcoming the rooms are lovely the rooms are always kept very clean and when i used to get back to my room in the evening i would find the bed covers turned and candles lit which is a lovely touch check in and check out were both very quick and easy they also allowed me to check in early at which is something i highly appreciated
