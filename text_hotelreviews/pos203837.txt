i always enjoy staying at the sanderson it is an extremely comfortable hotel the rooms are pristine clean i only had the breakfast during this visit but it was lovely freshly cooked and prepared food as usual all the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful the hotel is well located it s easily reachable from all the theatres shopping areas and it s just off oxford street right in the centre i can definitely recommend it
