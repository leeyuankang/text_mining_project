i booked a triple room the room is quiet large and has a balcony the location is really nice near the paddinton station just about minutes walk and hyde park the staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need i order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice i will definitely choose this hotel again when i go to london next time
