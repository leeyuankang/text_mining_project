a nice hotel in a very convenient location very clean people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference i also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries all this made up for the price which i initally thought a bit too much and i still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted a night for a compact room if i paid the full amount i would think it is overpriced but i guess that s london in the summer
