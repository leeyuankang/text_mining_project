this hotel is comprised of a variety of townhomes with an assortment of hotel rooms and apartments the rooms are period with old style dark wood brocade fabric victorian furniture but have modern bathrooms tvs wif etc the apartments are huge and appointed to a modern finish the hotel is on a quiet cul de sac and is set back from the main road bayswater it is very quiet and right next to hyde park lancaster gate tube station is currently closed but bayswater is a short walk and paddington is just minutes i really like this place
