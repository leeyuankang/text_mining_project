hotel is in an excellent and charming area of london very close to tube and bus stations one thing to note is the closest tube station lancaster gate is closed until july not a problem though as the buses run straight to the other stations otherwise it is a very short walk hotel staff were very accommodating with our requests directly across the street from a historic church and a two minute walk to hyde park minutes to albert memorial or kensington palace
