on our arrival we were rather impressed by the entrance but once inside our first thought was that the hotel could really do with some tlc checking in was a little difficult due to a little language barrier but we were very pleased as we had requested a room with some outside space and we got exactly that yes it was only a little terrace and you had to go through a large window to get there but we had asked for outside space and we got it our room was rather grand in fact it was huge and on two levels but it was very dated rather dusty and the mattress was so lumpy
