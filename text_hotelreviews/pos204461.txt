a quiet and peaceful hotel tucked away from the madness of london easy to access by bus the bed was big and very comfortable yes it could do with an update but all of the facilities were there and very serviceable what would this country do without the eu people who come to work here and provide us with such excellent customer service the receptionists were a credit to the hotel
