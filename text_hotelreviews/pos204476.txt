the hotel location is just a couple of minutes walk from hyde park and several bars and restaurants the hotel room we stayed in was bigger than i d anticipated townhouse and the decor was beautiful it was also very quiet inside and outside of the hotel which was great and unexpected due to the centrality of london the staff were really friendly polite and helpful the checkout time was also very useful great for a lie in such a lovely hotel to stay in
