this hotel was a welcome relief from a nightmare one night stay at a local airbnb we ended up canceling our airbnb in the middle of the night and booked here on a complete whim and thank goodness we did the location is perfect close to everything you would want to see in london close to all forms of public transportation and yet far enough away from noise and city bustle we were upgraded upon arrival and our room was wonderful very comfy bed and a terrace the staff were very sweet and though we didn t try any of the food there i m sure it s just as great
