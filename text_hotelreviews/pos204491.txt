great location we were a few minutes walk from hyde park and kensington palace which was the very reason for our stay and overall found it a very good hotel for anything more than we got i would have expected to pay more too so no complaints from me as i found it great value extra kudos to the lady who checked us in who i thought was absolutely lovely and welcoming very pleasant and would not hesitate to stay there again fantastic location if you re going to kensington palace like we were at good value too for the area
