the location is excellent right at the hyde park and within walking distance to paddington station lancaster gate bus stop is also nearby staff was very nice and polite and helpful we even got an better room than we have booked we loved the look of the lobby area very nice to come in after a long and cold day in the city and sitting in front of the fire
