the staff were very friendly and we were very privileged to receive an upgrade on our room which was unexpected but fantastic also due to a late departure time the hotel was very accommodating in allowing us to leave our luggage at the hotel until the following day the hotel is perfectly situated by hyde park and was easily accessible to most areas of central london i will definitely be making a return journey
