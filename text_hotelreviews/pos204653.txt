after a flight we showed up at the hotel looking all dishellevd and tired the staff could not have been more welcoming they let us freshen up downstairs and held our bags till checkin so we could wander around they gave us maps and heaps of info which really helped us get around hassle free every time we got home or left in the morning the staff made an effort to smile and see if we needed help and really made us feel comfortable even though it was absolutely freezing outside inside was so cosy and warm there is really nothing to fault perfect location literally minutes to walk to the nearest tube and right across from the park with a bike station almost at the front door plus lots of major attractions in walking distance the room was big and had a beautiful bathroom with good heating and wifi definitely good value for money and would stay here again next time we loved it
