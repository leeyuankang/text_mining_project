the hotel was in a great location close but not too close to town the staff were very helpful and friendly and we were upgraded to a suite which was an unexpected and welcome surprise the room was opulent in its day but needs a little tlc as wear is starting to show with that said it is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the bedroom is upstairs very grand the breakfast was good quality and well cooked all in all a great and very enjoyable stay
