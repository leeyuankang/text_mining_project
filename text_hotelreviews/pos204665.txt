staff were very friendly lovely bathrooms both in apartment and normal room but apartment shower looked amazing but water came out unevenly for the big head shower but there was also a smaller hand held one inside which was good even though the apartment floor had stains it still had the wow factor and a good main bed bit pricey but what you would expect for the location great for transport too taxi rank round the corner and bus stops minute away not at all far from the station either
