the staff were generally friendly and accommodating when it came time to leave they helped us by organising a taxi to take us to the airport which was much appreciated the room was kept clean and items like shampoo soaps and lotion were good quality and topped up regularly the bed was fairy comfortable and the room was a good size for the two of us
