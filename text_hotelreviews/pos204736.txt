customer service was very good and they kindly upgraded us as the first room they gave us was not what was in the pictures however it is quite tired and the decor is quite old fashioned it probably needs a makeover to be fair to the staff though they were very helpful and friendly and on the whole we had a lovely stay the location was fab for winter wonderland and the price was good
