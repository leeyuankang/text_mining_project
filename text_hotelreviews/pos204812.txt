the room was clean and very comfortable i had a great nights sleep i got a really quiet room too which was lovely location is great just on the edge of hyde park and the staff were really friendly and helpful giving me some recommendations on local places to eat the room had some gorgeous antique furniture in it which was in keeping with the building and made a nice change to the usual modern rooms very nice
