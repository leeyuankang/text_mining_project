loved loved loved our stay here yes it s a beautiful hotel with the most gorgeous textiles and facilities but the staff were what made this a truly awesome experience when we returned from our afternoon trip our yr old s toy owl was sleeping in a basket underneath a baby blanket it made us all chuckle and made our boy feel special every element from breakfast to room service the glorious beds to the impressive bathrooms was just that extra special will be returning again and again
