the rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in they ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward i ended up checking out after one night as i was there for days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me
