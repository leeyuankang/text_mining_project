very good location the staff is fantastic especially kais hope i spelt that correctly we had maps and directions to nice places there s a laundromat conveniently located across the street really nice eating places around le tambour food was delicious which was walking distance from the hotel there s a post office in the area the lighting in the room is dim so i guess it may sit well with some more than others there s two subways which are both walking distance
