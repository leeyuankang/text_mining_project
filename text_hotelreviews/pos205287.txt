great location for getting around town and seeing the sights paris has the best metro in the world but there s plenty to see within easy walking distance of this hotel the staff provided great recommendations for local eateries the wine bar restaurant just down the street would rate a return visit next trip shopping was varied and interesting ranging from french children s books for our grandchildren at euro each to a finely crafted hat for my wife from a local milliner
