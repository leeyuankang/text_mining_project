this was an outstanding experience in every way the room was actually larger than i anticipated decorated in quality period original or reproduction decor with a roomy bathroom very tastefully done and two small armoires the location is perfect in the heart of the latin quarter set back from a busy street in a charming cul de sac i enjoyed sipping my coffee on the tiny balcony each morning and the lobby is a joy to return to after wandering about paris the staff went out of its way to be helpful and responsive i would stay here again if i had the good fortune to return to paris at any time beware the tiny parision elevator of course only large enough for two people or one person plus one suitcase and three steps on each floor above from the elevator to the rooms i can t comment on breakfast because i only used my very tiny but completely adequate minibar fridge overstuffed with offerings of wine etc to buy microwave stovetop and sink i was even provided with two settings of plates wine glasses flatware wine opener and a large pot the only insignificant drawbacks were that the door to my room was such a tight fit that i almost needed help opening it and the somewhat shaky outlets are all near the floor so charging devices with my own adapters for european outlets was a challenge the cleaning service was a bit uneven but i didn t really mind any of these drawbacks because the overall advantages were so wonderful
