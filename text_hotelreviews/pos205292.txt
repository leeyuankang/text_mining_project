everything about our stay was better than we could have hoped this was our first trip to europe and we did not know what to expect we were delighted at every turn with the residence henri iv the staff every one of them went out of their way to make our stay wonderful the location was perfect on a quiet cul de sac in the latin quarter it was an easy walk to notre dame the pantheon the metro cafes restaurants parks etc the weather was a little warm when we were there so it was always nice to return from our walks to an air conditioned room we were on the floor nice view nice elevator too
