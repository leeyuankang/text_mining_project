this hotel was perfect the place is ideally located in the heart of historic paris yet secluded enough from the main streets to feel quiet and cosy our room was gorgeous large by european standards with a big comfortable bed roomy bathroom two lovely balconies and a kitchenette that had everything we needed for a couple meals in the room i loved the unique touches to the decor that felt both elegant but homey the breakfast was delicious held in a cute little room and hosted by an excellent and friendly server perhaps the best part of this wonderful hotel is the staff they are kind courteous and go the extra mile they remembered our names and room number offered terrific restaurant recommendations and helped with transportation questions when my husband unfortunately came down with a bad fever and cough we asked for assistance in finding a doctor not only did they get us help but they made an appointment for us with an physician right down the street that got him back to normal i ve stayed in a lot of cities in europe but this may be the best hotel i ve found yet it exceeded expectations at every level i wish we never had to leave
