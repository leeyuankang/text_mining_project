we actually stayed at grand royal hyde park as there was a problem with the boiler at paddington one to make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the hyde park it was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left london at breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want the room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe view wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise all manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner and hyde park metres away i would definitely recommend this to others
