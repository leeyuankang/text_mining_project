comfortable bed lots of room little extras like iron hairdrier came in handy we had a long snack in the purple bar on our last evening excellent food excellent service metro nearby walked to the arc de triomphe on the first evening the hotel is not cheap but we were spoiling ourselves and don t be afraid paris is wonderful
