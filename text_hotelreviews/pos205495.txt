the hotel lobby is exquisite and the grounds are impressive our double double room was the perfect size for women travelling together it provided every amenity including bathrobes and bathtub it even had english terrestrial tv channels the staff were friendly and assisted with recommendations and making a reservation in a paris nightclub on our behalf i would return to this hotel in a heartbeat ideally for a longer stay
