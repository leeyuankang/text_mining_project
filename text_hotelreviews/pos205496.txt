the room had an excellent price and they also gave us an upgrade to have free access to the executive lounge for unlimited food and drinks during all of our stay the hotel arranged a bottle of champagne plus cake and message for my friend since we were celebrating her birthday they let us stay a bit longer in the room and enjoy the spa which is definitely a big plus
