just blocks from victoria underground station and blocks from victoria rail station there are bus tours of london starting and ending near the station making this a pretty convenient location extra large rooms for a london hotel the staff is very friendly and helpful we highly recommend the hotel for this feature their tourism and dining recommendations were very helpful the rooms are the largest and nicest i have seen in many years of visiting london the room was very quiet and had good air conditioning
