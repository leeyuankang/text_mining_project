first and foremost the staff was extremely friendly attentive helpful and considerate for example when the team in the executive lounge discovered that my husband and daughter are gluten free they ensured that gf bread was available and did a specially prepared tray in the evenings the upgrade to the executive room with access to the lounge was a good investment and worth it the room was comfortable and well equipped the location was quite convenient
