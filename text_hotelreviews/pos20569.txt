we had a king room booked to attend a royal garden party the hotel is very convenient for the palace and a good location in all close to victoria and belgravia the room although not large had everything required for a comfortable stay the ghd hairdryer was a nice touch and a big improvement on most rubbish hotel hairdryers we did not use the mini kitchen other than for a couple of cups of tea but the water filter tap was appreciated i m always happy to see a solid loo door these days when new hotel style seems to be more important than practicality the hotel and room were very quiet great soundproofing the hotel staff were very professional very friendly and helpful we had an issue with the safe and tv when we arrived but help arrived immediately to resolve the problems so nice to stay somewhere where the employees are happy
