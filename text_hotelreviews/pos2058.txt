very comfortable room and excellent staff they welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions it was not expensive either i am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well overall an excellent and cozy experience
