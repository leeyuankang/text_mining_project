greaat location just a stroll to hyde park and easily walked to from paddington our room was great little kitchen facility lovely rainfall shower head modern interior decor and a fantastically comfy bed i wanted to take the pillows home with me the staff were efficient and friendly and our room was ready earlier than expected fortunately we had air conditioning as it was hot in london during our stay often air conditioners can be noisy but i had no problem sleeping through this one
