the whole hotel is extremely relaxed staff are welcoming friendly and professional the room was much larger than expected there was an excellent shower and an extremely comfortable firm bed with good quality bedding and pillows i was particularly pleased when they replaced the quilt for a sheet as it was extremely hot the kitchen area with fitted fridge and tea coffee facilities was an added bonus
