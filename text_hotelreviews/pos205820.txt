great location that was super easy to get to we picked this spot because of its closeness to paddington station where the express heathrow shuttle arrives but the location is a great launching point to reach hyde park kensington palace royal albert hall etc and a short distance by cab to parliament westminster abbey or buckingham palace paddington is also a subway line right to piccadilly circus so it was a nice clean boutique hotel but we weren t interested in the amenities we were interested in it being a good launch pad at a reasonable price it fit the bill
