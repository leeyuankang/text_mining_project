a friendly and knowledgeable reception is particularly welcome after a long trip on learning that i had not requested a room at street level without a second thought reception immediately offered me another room upstairs when i asked for directions to a particular restaurant close by reception pointed me in the right direction without needing to search on line for the location nothing beats friendly and well informed staff
