this hotel was fantastic i loved the personalize greeting on the tv when we came in the beds were incredibly comfortable i could have slept all day if i wasn t so excited about seeing the city the decor was chic and modern the shower was awesome the staff was very friendly it was also very nice to have a little mini kitchen and hairdryer i will absolutely recommend this to anyone i know travelling to london
