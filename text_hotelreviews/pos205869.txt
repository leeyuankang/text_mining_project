our stay here was simply perfect the location is very comfortable to travel around using the tubes being close to hyde park we loved going for short walks and lots of good restaurants were also easily accessible the staff were very friendly and the hospitality was very good facilities were just enough and the rooms very clean and neatly maintained overall we would love to come back and stay there we only had a trouble with the wifi being very slow rest all was perfect
