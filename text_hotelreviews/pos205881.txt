a fantastic room for the price we had a suite with separate seating and kitchenette everything looked new and beautifully done hotel is in a great location although this is paddington so not a terribly glamorous look out the window and easy walking distance to hyde park and paddington station a few minutes walk to facilities such as the mitre pub where we had dinner and coffee shops near paddington station would definitely recommend and i would stay here again
