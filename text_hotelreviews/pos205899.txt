the room was quite small but apparently new the double bed was very comfortable and the room in a basement but with a window was very quiet for london we wanted an hotel close to paddington station for a night stay at reasonable cost and this hotel i thought gave good value for money the room had a small kitchen area complete with hot plates m wave fridge toaster etc as well as a nespresso coffee machine the bathroom was well equipped with toiletries the shower was great and lighting very good the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and the location just to the north of hyde park was ideal for us
