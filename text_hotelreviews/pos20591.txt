we had a really lovely stay in the nadler victoria the staff was friendly and genuinely helpful at first we were a bit doubtful since our room was on the lower ground but after the first night we realized it was actually a good thing we could not hear traffic or nearby construction works at all and slept like babies during our vacation we will definitely choose the nadler again if we re coming to london
