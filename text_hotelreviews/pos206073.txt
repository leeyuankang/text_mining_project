the hotel is located in a central convenient location to metro stops oberkampff walk around the corner from hotel and republique walk from hotel and larger metro stop with more interchange lines the highlight of this hotel is the great bed which was the most comfortable i ve ever slept in during my travel and gave good rest after a long day touring i must also mention the team of arnaud gilles and jonathan who looked after us during our stay with the most helpful friendly service they also recommended wonderful local restaurants for dinner which we were not disappointed with i had requested a high floor with juliette balcony for our wedding anniversary and this was provided to us on our check in highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris as the location is the best in my opinion with restaurants cafes boulangeries and a laundromat small supermarket just around the corner from the hotel
