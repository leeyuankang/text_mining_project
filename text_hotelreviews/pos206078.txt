the rooms were spacious clean and airy very quiet location and staff were super helpful without being too in your face as soon as we arrived they personally showed us to our room and explained where everything was equipped us with a map and even an umbrella as it was raining heavily we will definitely be staying here again and are already planning our next trip later this year
