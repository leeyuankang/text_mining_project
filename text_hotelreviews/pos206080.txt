a great location within a short walk to the metro or indeed not a long walk to many beautiful places to see eat and shop the staff were friendly and helpful making you feel comfortable from prior check in with an email days before right through to check out great little fitness room and hammam spa add to your escape we had a standard room and it was cosy but for the price it was perfectly good value and we would highly recommend for a couple travelling
