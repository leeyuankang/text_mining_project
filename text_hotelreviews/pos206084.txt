as soon as i arrived i was made to feel like a valued customer the staff were friendly and helpful from the front desk to room service anything i requested such as breakfast in my room an iron a taxi was all swiftly dealt with the breakfast was great and for paris the price a very reasonable as a solo female traveller i felt safe inside the cocoon of my beautiful and very comfortable room and though outside on the street i did feel vulnerable see additional comment the hotel makes it s guests feel very welcome and secure oberkampf metro is a stones throw from the hotel i managed to run it in heels when late for a wedding so it must be close and is perfect for eurostar travellers such as me as it is only a few stops direct on line to gare du nord thank you to the hotel for giving me a very good experience of comfort and luxury on my fairly limited budget i hope to stay again and will recommend the hotel to everyone
