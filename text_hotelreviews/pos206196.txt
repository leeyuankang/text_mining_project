first of all we had never been to paris this hotel is a diamond in the rough our concierge lisa and the manager could not have been more helpful from showing on a map the exact way to take the subway or tube to all the historic places and to good places to eat i lost my phone and the manager showed us exactly how to use the computer for guests breakfasts could be ordered in different factions the subway is blocks away so you can get anywhere easily there is a flea market about blocks and it was fun who goes to paris for a flea market just never know what is around the corner
