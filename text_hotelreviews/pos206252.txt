the hotel is situated in a good location fairly quiet and close to tube station and amenities we arrived on a scorching hot day and the staff were very pleasant and considerate providing iced lemon water while we waited for our room to be available the room was fine very clean clothing storage was adequate bedding and towels were spotless
