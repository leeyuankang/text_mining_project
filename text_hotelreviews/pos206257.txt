staff were very polite upon arrival our room although smaller than i anticipated was extremely clean which automatically makes me feel relaxed in a hotel the onsite bar restaurant is fab and i really liked the overall feel and decor of the hotel would definitely recommend it i also liked that as a genius member i got the perk of having a late checkout free of charge without the late checkout fee
