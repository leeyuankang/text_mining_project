great service warm welcome and a free upgrade to a small studio suite the whole place was clean well maintained parking on site and a district line tube station just a minute walk away the area seemed lovely and friendly even when returning after midnight lots of shops cafe s and quiet bars close to the hotel if you want an alternative to the super facilities offered by the hotel
