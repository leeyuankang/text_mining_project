the location was of prime importance direct short journey time rail connection into central london very pleasant location near riverside walks bars and excellent restaurants although the property is located on a busy road the south circular our room was very quiet and overlooked a garden with trees we found the hotel very tranquil and relaxing to return to after our action packed days in town would stay here again
