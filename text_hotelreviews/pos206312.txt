i stay at this hotel on a regular basis as it s a minute walk from my daughter s flat and provides free parking putney has lots to offer bars restaurants and shops it s so very easy to get the train into the centre of london or out to wimbledon the hotel s garden rooms are quiet modern and immaculately clean
