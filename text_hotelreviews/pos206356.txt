room was well equipped and laid out even had bottled water in the fridge which is a big plus so many hotels charge for it which is a real rip off we didn t use the bar or have breakfast as we were meeting friends for the evening and also for brunch the next morning we stayed in the newer rooms though so this could make a difference worth asking for also a rear view room as it was very quiet
