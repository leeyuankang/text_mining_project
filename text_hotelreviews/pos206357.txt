party of six for daughters birthday cooked breakfast could be larger otherwise the lodge was pretty much perfect free parking attractive exterior leading in to a very stylish hotel but it was the staff more than anything that shined brightest friendly professional and really personable had a great experience and would definitely return many thanks
