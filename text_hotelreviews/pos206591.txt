the staff were amazing so friendly and helpful i loved that i was given a fruit juice at check in after a huge long haul flight and that i was able to check in right away it was early morning the room was small but perfectly adequate for a solo traveller and there were so many extras fruit biscuits truffles a small bottle of wine bottled water this is a feel good hotel they really know how to look after their guests
