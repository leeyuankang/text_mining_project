the staff was very friendly and always made sure that everything was ok with our stay the small details such as a birthday treat and bottled water in the room on arrival made all our experience even better even though the room wasn t very big it had enough space for people to spend the night the bed was comfortable and both the room and bathroom were clean and airy
