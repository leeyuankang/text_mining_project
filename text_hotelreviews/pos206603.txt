the room is as expected not big but enough with a normal double bed closet a bigger then normal hotel flat tv and a big toilet and shower room the hotel s location is superb from kensington gardens hyde park and about from bayswater underground from queensway underground they both are on different lines so more travel options for you also the hotel is in a neighberhood which is lively at night the restaurants shops are open after the average closing time in london which can be nice when you come back after a long day looking for something to eat
