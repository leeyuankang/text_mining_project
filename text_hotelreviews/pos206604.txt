the location is great it s just a few minutes away from the beautiful hyde park the bayswater underground station is almost just outside the queensway station is not faraway either we walked through hyde park towards the oxford street one sunny afternoon it was just perfekt notting hill is close by also walking distance very very nice area the street where the hotel is is very quiet with elegant white houses but just turn around the corner and get into the next street you can find all kinds of restaurant and shop the staff is great giving you a very pleasant feeling the room is clean and comfortable
