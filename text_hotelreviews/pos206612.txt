the bed was super comfortable the bathroom was large with a very long and deep bath the staff were super helpful and very friendly you receive a drink upon check in the hotel also provides you with a smart phone you can take with you around the city with unlimited data and local calls this was super helpful as we could quickly look up a place to visit restaurant and use google maps to find how to get there and back to hotel wifi was great no issues at all hotel is close just a couple minutes walk to two tube stations with different lines meaning it is very easy to get around plenty of places to eat offering a wide variety of cuisine all within walking distance would definitely go back
