staff couldn t be more friendly helpful and welcoming the hotel was spotlessly clean the location is very good on a quiet street but just a street away from shops restaurants and tube station a short walk to the bus stop too despite the room being a little on the small side it was very well appointed and decorated to a high standard it had everything you could want just bijou the bathroom was not cramped often a problem when space is limited nice big shower cubicle and very well laid out
