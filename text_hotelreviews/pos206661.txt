the facilities were very nice and the room had a nice sized bed big television and a closet to store coats i liked that little toiletries were provided as when traveling europe those things are usually not provided great location as well the tube is right down the road and very close to kensington palace it was quiet at night as well good breakfast spread but there is a cute cafe right up the road that provides a great breakfast for less
