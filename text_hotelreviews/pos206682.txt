the accommodation was fresh clean and comfortable but rather on the small side but it did not bother us as we were out most of the time as long as we could move around safely and put our stuff away this was fine the bathroom with shower was just right for us as we are bathroom the disabled category lovely and friendly helpful staff cannot fault anything we would certainly go back there
