we had a great stay at the nadler victoria and would definitely book again the room was lovely and the kitchenette was a fab bonus especially as we had a young baby with us the hotel was able to provide us with a travel cot there were lots of little touches that showed great attention to detail ghd hairdryers connection cables micro usb etc staff were nice and location was perfect
