the hotel is a short walk to two different underground stops and the kensington gardens portion of hyde park with simple access to the bayswater circle line underground stop we had the rest of london within easy reach the staff were quite friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable the room was very well appointed and the bed was comfortable compared to american hotels the room was very tiny sq ft sq m but on par with some of the other hotels we ve stayed in london paris and amsterdam at the small coffee valet they had a uk plug eu plug and us plug in the wall and they provided a single universal power adapter to use near the bed if desired this was a nice touch
