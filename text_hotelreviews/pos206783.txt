the hotel was very clean and the staff helpful it was useful to be able to check in and leave the luggage in the morning and then return in the evening collect the bags and go straight to the room the fresh flowers around the hotel were also appreciated and the ones on the breakfast table filled my girlfriend s heart with joy unfortunately the cost of the breakfast did not have the same effect on mine but this was the only slight downside to a very enjoyable experience
