we had a lovely stay here for four days the location as great and easily got around the city from here lots of restaurants and cafes by victoria station as well the room was a little tight but not unusual for london everything was well designed and was pleasantly surprised to find a microwave in the little pantry as well on top of it all staff was always super friendly and dealt well to respond to any requests we made
