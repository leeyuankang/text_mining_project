really down to the helpfulness of lina the manager and her staff i booked at the last minute on valentine s day and i could see that the hotel was busy but despite this i got excellent service and upgraded to a room with a bath tub without any fuss as my arm was in a plaster cast at the time also new mattresses and carpets in rooms and minute walk to the tube station
