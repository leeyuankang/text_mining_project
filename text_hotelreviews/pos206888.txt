the hotel has a lovely london style atmosphere the room was exactly like on the pictures if not a little more spacious very comfortable clean and had excellent wifi the staff is extremely friendly and helpful they packed me some breakfast since i left the hotel early the location is perfect next to hyde park and a few minutes walk from the metro station bayswater
