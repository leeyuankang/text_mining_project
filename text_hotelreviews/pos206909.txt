i paid for the night which in london is cheap tea and coffee facilities in the room and a fridge which was handy if you re staying more than one night then probably not for you as the rooms are small we stayed for one night as we were seeing a show and having the saturday and sunday day time sight seeing so the room was fit for purpose in that respect just somewhere to lay your head
