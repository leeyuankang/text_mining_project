nothing to like we was not give the chance to see the room as we were informed by a very unfriendly receptionist they had double booked our room and we was put in thier sister hotel on the otherside of the road this was not a star hotel the room we changed as soon as we saw it as it was not fit to stay in the second room we had was not a lot better the room was about square with steep steps into the room as this was supposed to have been a special occasion for us and we were also assured this room was an upgrade the whole event was laughable sadly and we felt very let down by shaftesbury hyde park hotel
