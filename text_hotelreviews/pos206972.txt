the location is excellent as a solo traveler being able to walk to sites or take the tube from either stop was amazing the london sights are so much more spread out than i thought so even if you aren t staying right in the city center it s convenient the room was small but clean and comfortable for one person a couple might want to get a larger room but if you re on a tight budget it s manageable if you re there to just sleep after a long day of sightseeing then it s great the bathroom is also modern which is nice
