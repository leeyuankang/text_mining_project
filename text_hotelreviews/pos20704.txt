all the staff were friendly and efficient without exception the room small double was small but well equipped comfortable and stylish i loved the fur throw and the slightly surreal illuminated book spines the recharging points and extra cables were a nice touch the bathroom was pristine and the shower was enormous the teeny kitchenette was just what we needed and i wish my sink at home looked as shiny though a dishcloth might have helped me leave it tidier we asked for a quiet room and it really was quiet no disturbances at all honestly the most peaceful night s sleep i have ever had at a hotel this was an exploratory visit we were sizing the place up for a possible return to a nadler with our child and dog and it certainly convinced us to do this
