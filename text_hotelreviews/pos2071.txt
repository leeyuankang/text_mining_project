really good location very friendly staff and very helpful we were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles we asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar excellent
