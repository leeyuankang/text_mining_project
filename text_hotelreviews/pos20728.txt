the nadler victoria just became our favorite hotel anywhere in the world what an amazing experience the staff was beyond professional and so helpful they exhibited the kind of customer service in the hospitality business a frequent traveler only dreams of in fact we didn t know it still existed so good on them shout out to sophie who was amazing and really helped make our short stay in london memorable the location couldn t be better close to buckingham palace walking distance to so many things and the tube is right there it s also super easy access to the train station at victoria station to get to the airport gatwick direct heathrow a couple stop overs but easy the room was huge and so comfortable they had a little kitchenette that was extremely helpful the beds are more comfortable then my own bed at home big bathroom with lovely amenities the hotel does not have a restaurant which some folks list as a negative but i gotta say it really didn t matter it s very boutique style there are so many places close by to eat and also little bodega type mini marts so not having a bar or restaurant or that kind of full service hotel really didn t matter the location the rooms themselves and the staff won us over i ll never stay anywhere else in london again fantastic value for the money
