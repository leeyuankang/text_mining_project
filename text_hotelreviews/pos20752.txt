the hotel is new and really great value for money while i was on business and alone i would also recommend the hotel for couples and leisure trip while rooms are quite small they are fine and in london most of the day is spent out touring the facilities are good with basic kitchen in each room and staff were helpful and friendly while the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar this is not an issue as there are plenty within meters and cafes within meters for breakfast also the hotel will order in for you or you can do yourself all in all a great choice and value
