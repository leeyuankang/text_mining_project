myself and my girlfriend had a wonderful overnight stay it was a special occasion and the staff went the extra mile to ensure we were extremely well looked after the bedroom suite was luxurious and the hotel itself was perfect from the decor to the amenities we could not fault it the adjoining pub serves great beer and food we enjoyed lunch there the following day before departing i have stayed in other london hotels which are pricier but did not match the level of service we received here excellent value for money highly recommended
