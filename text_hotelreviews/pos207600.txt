the friendly staff who were really helpful the wow factor suite that we were upgraded to was outstanding the bed was so comfy i didn t want to get out of it it was our wedding anniversary weekend and they certainly knew how to spoil us bubbles chocolate and strawberries on arrival and our bed turned back with towels as swans and rose petals was a lovely gesture we were truly delighted with all the surprises and will definitely be returning outstanding
