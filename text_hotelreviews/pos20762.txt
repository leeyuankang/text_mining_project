everything this place is the most technologically advanced hotel we ve stayed in the staff were really nice the location was awesome and the room was really well looked after there was a nice kitchenette with nespresso machine and kettle and overall the price was much cheaper that other hotels in the area also we just got engaged and they gave us a bottle of wine to celebrate
