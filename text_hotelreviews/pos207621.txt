it was my wife s birthday which i mentioned to the hotel prior to arriving on arrival we were treated to a very warm welcome an upgrade and some treats in the room the staff couldn t have done any more for us on our stay in particular gemma who was great the room was spacious club room clean and comfortable with no outside noise location is excellent just a short walk to the nearest tube station the pub next door has a lot of character and sells a nice selection of beers
