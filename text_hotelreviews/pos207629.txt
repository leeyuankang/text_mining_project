stay there all the time when in london one of the best beds i have slept in staff always on their game and very helpful long queue at check in due some convention that weekend but apologies given straight away and was shown to room if not stayed there before it is a bit of maze but you get your bearings quickly continental breakfast in the club room was quite good in the package apart from dirty coffee cups in the room which was quickly attended to i would add i cannot fault our stay will definitely be back
