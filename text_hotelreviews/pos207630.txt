liked everything would stay here again and would recommend to everyone the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was lovely and everything we needed was in there including a spare umbrella for the typical english weather luckily not needed it is a little out the way from the centre of london if you are being a tourist however we got taxis to and from which was fine and no problem
