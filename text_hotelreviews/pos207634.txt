the hotel was beautiful and immaculate the staff impeccably professional and friendly there wasn t a single staff member we walked passed that didn t say hello or good day the room was as well equipped as any hotel i ve stayed in and to think it was cheaper than most other options available amazing value for money couldn t recommended highly enough
