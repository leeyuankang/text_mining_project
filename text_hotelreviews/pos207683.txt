the bed was ridiculously comfortable spent the night in the montcalm club room recommended and would choose this room again myself staff are brilliant i was greeted on arrival but a couple of members of staff whilst i waited to check in they were polite and cracked on with conversation like they knew me whilst telling me a little about the history of the hotel and how they can be of help during my stay the location is pretty good and convenient shops are within a couple of minutes walking and moorgate underground station a minute walk away
