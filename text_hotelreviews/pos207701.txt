the property itself was beautiful but the staff really made this hotel come to life they could not be nicer or more helpful they tailored our stay to suit us perfectly and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable as it was for a special occasion also in a great location a minute walk to the closest underground station and a minute walk to liverpool street station
