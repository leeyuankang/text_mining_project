hotel was in a great location close to several tube stops so it was easy to get around the hotel itself was really well decorated with nice furnishings as the hotel is an old brewery it was quite a maze to get around and rhe ceiling was quite low in our room but i think it just added to the charm the staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay
