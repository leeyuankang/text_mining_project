the hotel is beautiful and the staff was very helpful the room was not very big but it had everything one needs and the bathroom has lovely amenities the bed was super comfortable we only stayed one night but i would recommend it for even more although it is not in the heart of london the neighborhood is very nice and the tube station is on foot
