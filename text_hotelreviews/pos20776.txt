the hotel is brand new very modern and stylish and decorated to a high standard i was very comfortable in my american style room which had a small fridge microwave kettle and coffee machine as well as functioning wifi and new tech lighting system and security however the most important thing was the staff who are very welcoming friendly and helpful but also they are excited and happy to be working here which makes a huge difference not only that but i left my nightdress behind and emailed the following day asking them to keep it until i was back in london weeks later which they did so i am very impressed
