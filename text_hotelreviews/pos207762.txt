the hospitality i received from the staff was absolutely first rate because it was my birthday weekend i was upgraded to a beautiful room with a complimentary bottle of red wine and some chocolate truffles and finally if that wasn t generous enough we were also given a complimentary breakfast we were truely amazed by the generosity of the hotel and we will definitely be staying there again and not only because of the lovely extras but because the hotel is beautiful the location is fantastic and the food at the jugged hare was just delicious i would highly recommend this hotel
