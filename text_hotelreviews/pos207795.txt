full place was excellent and the club room was well worth the extra nice continental breakfast and girl in club room very good staff in the hotel were all very good and room was great great idea having the free mobile in the room for use even though we didn t need the jugged hare was great for a drink at night and had very good sunday lunch there we stayed over a weekend friday to monday and got an excellent deal due to the area being very quiet at weekends having stayed in area before though we know the links around london are excellent and easy to anywhere from the hotel
