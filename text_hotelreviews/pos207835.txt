we have just left this hotel after a fantastic city break from the moment you walk through the doors you are greeted with a warm welcome from the porters to reception which was a quick and easy process the porter then took us to our room yes the hotel is split into all different levels but that gives the place some character we stayed in a montecalm club room which was very spacious breakfast is served at the gastro bar attached to the hotel called the jugged hare breakfast was good with a good selection the only warning i would say is that it gets very busy and cramped on a monday morning due to all the city workers having breakfast so get there after i am finding it difficult to rate this as star due to the issues that we incurred it sits between and stars it just lacks the final polish and finesse
