i stay in a lot of hotels in london from the moment i got there to the mimute we left the staff were exceptional the service is second to none the price does not reflect the standard or the facilities very pleased and i will definitely be staying again no where competes very cost effective if your looking for a quality hotel great facilities at a great price
