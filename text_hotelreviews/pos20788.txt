staff were extremely considerate friendly and helpful we had the standard double room and it was small but really well designed and set up and even had mini kitchen facilities sink fridge microwave kettle and nespresso machine hotel is mins walk from victoria tube train stations so very convenient if you are coming from heathrow or gatwick the hotel is brand new and is basically just the reception and rooms no restaurant etc but there are plenty of places to eat around and it was perfect for what we needed
