reception staff were beyond star couldn t fault anything about our stay i had emailed ahead to mention it was my husband s birthday to our amazement we were upgraded as were the other two rooms for our offspring and their partners and there was even a bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived we would have no hesitation whatsoever in staying at this hotel again
