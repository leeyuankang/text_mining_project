the montcalm at the brewery is as the name would suggest in the old whitbread brewery right beside the barbican the building reflects its history and is quirky and stylish our room was smallish but had most everything you would need including slippers and robe though there was only one robe when we checked in it was on the top floor with only two other rooms in the wing and had a small window overlooking the courtyrard and the gilded weathervane and clock from the brewery days the rooms comes with a smart phone that can be used for touring the city and making free phone calls i didn t use this but it is a nice touch overall it is good value for london convenient to the underground and a well appointed and pleasant place to stay and i would certainly return
