the staff couldn t possibly have been more accommodating given that my husband and i were travelling with our newborn baby we were offered help getting our daughter s pram in and out i never had to battle opening doors because the staff were totally on the ball and everyone greeted us with smiles we were upgraded to a suite in their apartments over the road from the main hotel because it would be a quieter room for us and the baby which was lovely of them the room was superb i wanted to take the bed home with me everything was immaculately clean the shower was great and we wanted for nothing in the room regarding facilities a fantastic stay for a very reasonable price by london standards and i would go back should i be working in or visiting the area again
