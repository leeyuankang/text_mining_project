we stayed room only which was very comfortable quiet with excellent en suite facilities we liked the location close to barbican and moorgate tube stations we also enjoyed the fact that it is in the financial district at the weekend and found it amazingly quiet the jugged hare restaurant was very good if a little expensive all the staff were excellent
