we had at first a room which was directing to the courtyard it was a bit dark and noisy due to the ac ventilators and you couldn t open the windows i like to sleep with open windows we asked if it would be possible to change the room and the very friendly lady at the reception checked with the manager and gave us another one which was bright calm and friendly before we left the hotel the manager enquired about the problems we had with the other room very delightful experience would definetely come again
