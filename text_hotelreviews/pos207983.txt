very welcoming and attentive staff clean comfortable room on ground floor some slight traffic noise as a result as expected in central london i really cannot fault the service i was travelling with my sister niece we had two adjacent rooms we spent our time exploring london so i cannot comment on any of the facilities or even breakfast but given what we did experience of the hotel i would expect them to be impressive
