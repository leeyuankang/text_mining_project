very comfortable quiet room excellent breakfast excellent situation excellent bathroom partitioned off from room by glass screen so you have to know who you are sharing with quite well though there is a screen to pull down however this means you can watch tv from the bath or loo uniformly charming staff just to note you have to set the little light with the picture of the maid by the door if you want the room done we should have read the room notes quirky layout memorise the route to your room
