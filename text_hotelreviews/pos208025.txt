it was my wife s birthday so we d booked in for the weekend at a hotel that we d normally consider to be several points above our usual level it was well worth it despite the fact that the staff were dealing with three different wedding parties and a particularly moody bridezilla at the time we booked in they found the time to make us feel welcome and surprise us with a bottle of champagne and a divine chocolate brownie later that night we returned to our room after seeing a show to find the staff has covered the bed with rose petals and arranged them to make a the room was very nice luxurious without being showy the beds were perfect and the ritual of working out how the bathroom shower worked was made easy by the simple instructions next to the plumbing the hotel is in a converted brewery hidden behind the barbican on the fringes of the city during the weekend it s a quiet oasis in the middle of the town
