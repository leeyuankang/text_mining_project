the staff were unfailingly polite and helpful our club room was very acceptable with some nice luxury touches we really appreciated the canapes and drinks in the club lounge which set us up nicely for our barbican theatre trip just one minute s walk away the hotel is very well placed for sight seeing in the city of london and is an interesting historic building in its own right if you don t fancy the dining opportunities within the hotel there is plenty of choice in whitecross street just across the road all in all a very nice place to stay at a decent online price we recommend it
