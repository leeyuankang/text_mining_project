we absolutely loved our stay from start to finish the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was amazing we stayed in the montcalm club room which was beautiful and very clean we arrived back to our room later that evening to find a bottle of wine and cupcakes complimentry as it was a special occasion and also the travel cot had been set up with a duck for the bath and a grooming set for our child would highly recommend and we will definitely be returning
