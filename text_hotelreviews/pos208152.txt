hotel staff is very friendly courteous and professional i enjoyed my stay hotel does have a bit of retro touch in its exterior primarily the entire building block which i liked but interiors and the rooms are no less than any state of the art modern hotels the hotel is at a great location a minute walk to tube stations and a minute tube ride to all the major attractions
