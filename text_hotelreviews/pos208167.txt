there are not enough superlatives to describe how amazing this hotel is me and my partner celebrated my birthday here and when my partner emailed them they helped to make our celebrations even better we had an extremely warm welcome and the staff were second to none i would highly recommend the montcalm club room as this is excellent value for money and well worth the extra expense as you get access to the lounge with complimentary snacks and alcohol the breakfast in the jugged hare is also worth the extra expense overall an excellent hotel and we will be returning in the future
