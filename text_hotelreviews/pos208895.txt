the reception team were friendly and helpful the room was airy and light with some lovely period features and the balcony overlooked an attractive road with the eiffel tower just visible above the buildings opposite the bed was extremely comfortable we loved the proximity to the champs elysees with its shops and restaurants and charles de gaulle etoile was within minutes walk we thoroughly enjoyed our stay
