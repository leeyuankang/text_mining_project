cute little boutique hotel one block off of the champs lys es i m sure we had the smallest room but it was clean with a new small bathroom and we were in paris in an old building so did not expect or want a modern north american hotel walking distance to louvre mins walked to the eiffel tower mins many many restaurants close by and shops every which way you turned great for just window shopping in the evenings too never felt unsafe in the area front staff were courteous and helpful with all our questions always a taxi or waiting just across the street from the entrance to the hotel we did not have the breakfast offered i would return to this hotel and recommend it
