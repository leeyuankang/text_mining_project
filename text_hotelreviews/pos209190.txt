there are not many bad things i can say about this hotel overall excellent stay the rooms although small are clean with a large flat screen tv nespresso machine dressing gowns and slippers etc all included the pool and jacuzzi was open early until late in the evening we were only a min walk to the metro station the staff were all helpful and you could leave your baggage in the hotel after you ve checked out and collect them whenever you re ready to leave
