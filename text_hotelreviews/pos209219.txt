perfect location close to metro stations and had some fantastic restaurants and caf s close by of particular note is caf d eugene opposite the porte de versailles tram stop where i had the nicest burger at a reasonable price for paris and au plaisir du pain pastry stop right next the balard metro station the most beautiful croissants and pain au chocolat i have ever tasted also a quiet and calm area which was very relaxing
