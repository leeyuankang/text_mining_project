a nice hotel with underground parking which is why we picked the hotel the pool was a bonus as it was a nice size clean and warm the room was a bit on the small size and the toilet was very small but it was clean and well equipped with a coffee machine we also had a dressing gown slippers and plenty of towels a bit on the outskirts but very clean and comfortable
