the location for the hotel is great easy walking distance to the metro making sightseeing around paris a doddle the hotel was nice and clean breakfast was lovely with a good selection and the parking facility albeit a bit of a tight squeeze if you have a bigger sized car was convenient staff generally very friendly and knowledgeable
