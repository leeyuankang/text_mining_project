nice comfy bed nice big shower room glass walls so privacy is limited decent sized tv with some english channels to keep kids entertained great location minutes walk from the metro took us minutes to get to the eiffel tower nice pool spent most of our evenings here great selection of food for breakfast if a little expensive parking we specifically needed parking as we finished our road trip here parking is a day but is located directly underneath the hotel parking leads directly into the hotel lobby no need to drag your luggage around
