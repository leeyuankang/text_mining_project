the hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of london and was very comfortable i believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it works the staff were friendly its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted
