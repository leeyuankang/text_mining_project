room executive king room was cramped walls dirty toilet roll holder coming away from wall and what we thought was a bit of cake left behind by previous occupants because it was dry and exposed to elements was actually a complimentary cake the bed was comfortable enough i paid extra for a full english breakfast which turned out to be turkey rashers with a chicken sausage and beans which were sour because they had gone off serving staff were nice and very apologetic though all in all a poor experience we won t be returning to that hotel and since it was our first experience at a best western hotel we are a bit dubious about trying another one
