the king size room was clean and tidy and the en suite was a nice size however we didn t like the shower and set up of the bathroom because there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom and when in the shower due to the size and where the shower was the water went everywhere and everywhere was left wet once you had showered needs a short screen or curtain to stop this from happening the bed wasn t the most comfortable and the walls are thin to the point i could hear the man upstairs conversation when he woke me up at the staff were lovely and friendly and did all they could to make the stay enjoyable
