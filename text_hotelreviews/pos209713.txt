this is a good best western hotel when you consider the problems of running a hotel in a fairly old london building breakfast was very good with a wide choice of fruit cereals and hot buffet the rates which include breakfast are fairly good value compared with the rather steep breakfast charge if paid on the day the staff were excellent overall very friendly and helpful particularly in the breakfast dining room generally fairly good and good value considering london hotel prices
