the hotel is in a great location with easy access to buses and tubes the rooms were of good size if a little dark the back of the hotel bed comfortable and the bathroom was very nice with a lovely size bath sadly we had a problem with lights and air conditioning the main lights above the tv were not working we logged a call a maintenance man came within minutes and they were fixed but he legged it without fixing the air conditioning later the lights wouldn t go off something we didn t notice until we came back late we had to sleep with these lights on however this was addressed in the final bill breakfast was continental style good and adequate staff friendly helpful and smiley i would use this hotel again
