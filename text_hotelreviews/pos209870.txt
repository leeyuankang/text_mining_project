the staff was friendly the rooms were clean the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was modern and even had a towel warmer our first room had a large window which faced the street breakfast in the attached restaurant was wonderful it wasn t far from the tube station and there was a bus stop a few steps away and a train station a block away there was a tesco just across the street which was very convenient
