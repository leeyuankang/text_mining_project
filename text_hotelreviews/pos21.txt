the breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet we did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional we had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location
