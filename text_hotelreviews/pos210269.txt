the bed was comfy and the space within the room is sufficient for our family the design is modern and it s clean the bathroom has a good space and my kid loved the bath tub of course the location is great we could go on foot to tower bridge etc it s next to the mind boggling borough market despite the unfortunate incident the underground is near and we could travel further conveniently staff were helpful
