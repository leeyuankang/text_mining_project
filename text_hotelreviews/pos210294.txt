the location of this hotel was just perfect for our trip and we were able to combine business with pleasure because of it we were given an executive room which was extremely comfortable a really good size working area and a great bathroom an excellant quality bed black out curtains made for a refreshing sleep and the self service breakfast was great value with a good selection of hot and cold foods available this was our first trip to a novotel hotel but it definitely won t be our last
