location was great a minute walk to the tube station and just beside borough market and the shard the hotel room was extremely clean and the bathroom was extremely modern the room contained bluetooth speakers which was a nice touch also staff members were extremely friendly and attentive i couldn t recommend the hotel enough for value for money
