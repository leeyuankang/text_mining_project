we stayed at the dorchester for my sisters wedding the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a comfortable stay before our travel we were worried about little things that might ruin our stay especially as we were traveling with our month twins when we got to the hotel the staff we ever so polite amicable and most importantly approachable we managed to have a comfortable stay and little things like sterilizing babies bottles making their milk and ensuring they had comfortable naps became least of out worries as the hotel offered a complimentary extension to our check out time which was after the wedding ceremony had finished this allowed us to enjoy the wedding and plan our babies needs accordingly thanks to all the staff at the dorchester including the doormen who were extremely polite and welcoming we certainly will come back again
