we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel me and my partner stopped here for nights and found the staff very helpful the bed was comfortable and the room was very spacious the metro station is right outside the hotel so access to the centre of paris is easy despite being in a busy part of the city you could not really hear any noise from outside when you were inside the hotel room this hotel provides good value for money
