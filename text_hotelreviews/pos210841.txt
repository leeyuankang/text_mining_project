did not sample the food since there were so many restaurants within five minute walk room initial night was very cramped but was upgraded to a very comfortable larger room for next several nights front desk staff especially rita marques went above and beyond chose this hotel since it is about two minute walk from my son who lives on islington green over all my wife and i were very pleased
