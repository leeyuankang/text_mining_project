breakfast was delicious i found the porridge on the second day everywhere was spotlessly clean and i m very fussy so that is a deal breaker for me i liked that the staff greet guests and take care to learn what you like and need bathroom was roomy and modern and everything worked properly my room was super quiet which was brilliant and the lighting was good lots of hotels forget that we need reading lights but the hilton s led lamps are very good and in the right place very nice quality linen and towels
