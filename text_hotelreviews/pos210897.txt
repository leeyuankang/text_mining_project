excellent location a few minutes walk from angel underground the hotel is set back from the main street so it is very quiet but with a huge choice of restaurants and bars virtually on the doorstep we had a fantastic view of the city skyline from our room upon arrival only one of the rooms was ready and after heading out for a walk and returning at it still wasn t ready the receptionist gave us access to the executive lounge so we could wait there and extended the access for the whole of our stay even though we didn t have a chance to use the lounge again it was a very nice gesture and immediately turned an unhappy client into a happy one
