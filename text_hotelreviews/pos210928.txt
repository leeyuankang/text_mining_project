very good location with shops and restaurants just outside the hotel very modern room with everything you need and spacious and clean bed was comfy bathroom nice it was overall a very nice stay with lovely staff requested to check in early when booking and the room was all ready for us when we checked in hours before normal check in time staff were kind and allowed us to keep our luggage with them after we checked out so we could have a relaxing lunch and final walk around london before leaving would definitely stay again
