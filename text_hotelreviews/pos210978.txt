room service was prompt and tasty for a late late supper bed was very comfortable as was the shower which just makes the difference in the morning staff were friendly and helpful but i didn t ask much of them apart from an early ceck in request that was helpfully accommodated nd i called ahead for that carpark below is also very convenient and ok for price when using hilton discount for staying
