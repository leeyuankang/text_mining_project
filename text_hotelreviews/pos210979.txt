comfortable hotel and perfect location for st pancras international and an early morning eurostar close to tube and bus stops for visiting london sights and great choice of restaurants nearby first time we ve been to islington and would definitely go there again as it s a relatively quiet area and much more pleasant than kings cross didn t have breakfast as we had to leave before but there were facilities for making tea and coffee in room
