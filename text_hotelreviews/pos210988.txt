liliana in reception was incredibly helpful we checked in before setting off for the wedding and on our return the cot was set up in our daughter s room and all our luggage was there we had three rooms and she made sure they were all together nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were friendly and extremely willing to make our stay enjoyable
