the staff were outstanding we had an overnight flight so were very early and tired to say the least when we arrived they had the room ready for us within the hour just time to grab a quick coffee at least hours earlier than expected check in time and were so friendly and helpful regarding details of the surrounding area i would highly recommend this hotel for staff cleanliness location and price
