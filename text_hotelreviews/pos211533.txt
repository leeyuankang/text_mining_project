the location is beautiful the entire area is surrounded by museums both hyde park and the royal albert hall are minutes away just up the street the hotel is clean and the staff are helpful and very friendly because the hotel is pretty small nestled in an old london house this makes it very quiet with a strong feeling of privacy compared to larger hotels nothing in particular stands out to be praised the rooms are what one would expect bedding is clean and soft the beds are comfortable
