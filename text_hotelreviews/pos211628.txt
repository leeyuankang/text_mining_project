so close to everything kensington has to offer right across the street from the natural history museum and the v a kensington palace is a minute walk as is all the shopping in kensington there are tube stations within minutes of the hotel as well friendly staff comfortable albeit tiny room i didn t wake up in time for breakfast but it smelled delicious free wifi is a nice bonus
