the location was excellent and the staff was attentive every time we entered and left the hotel the room was really comfortable for two of us to stay in and i loved the bathroom everything looked brand new i extended to spend some time with family on the weekend and they went out of their way to make the transition into two rooms easy they upgraded my accommodations that i had booked online this was a nice surprise check out was a breeze
