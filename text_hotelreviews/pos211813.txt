the beds were unbelievably comfortable all premises were clean the location is great and the lobby and bar d cor is very inviting oh and the staff are very accommodating because of its location you will pay a bit extra here it s great for a first or second visit to paris but if you re familiar with the city i would suggest staying farther from the champs elysees merely based price value i would recommend this hotel to others
