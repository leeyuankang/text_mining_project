amazing location one block from the middle of the champs elysees and a mere minute walk to the eiffel the concierges were ok but one was outstanding william he helped us with all our booking requests and even followed up with us to confirm them the bed and room were very modern and comfortable great space in the room perfect for longer stays close to several metro stops
