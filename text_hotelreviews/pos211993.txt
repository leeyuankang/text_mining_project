the interior of this hotel is i would say unique the building is lovely and they have done an amazing job of redeveloping it into a stylish and extremely comfortable hotel our room was lovely as well as quiet the hotel is in a fabulous location the street is vibrant during the day and quieter at night the ile saint louis generally is the perfect place to stay to explore the centre of paris there are plenty of places to eat nearby and it is a minute walk to notre dame and the siene highly recommend in every way we also fell in love with the hotel dog even though we only saw it once all too briefly
