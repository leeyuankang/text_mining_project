the location of this hotel on ile st louis is absolutely fabulous easy walk to notre dame st chappelle nearby museums and great eateries general manager natalie and her staff were very friendly and helpful and you re just a few steps from the best ice cream and gelato in all of paris amarino bertillion although the rooms are somewhat small the hotel has a wonderful lobby relaxing area downstairs while we were in paris there were lots of concerts special events going on around the area but our hotel on ile st louis remained nice quiet
