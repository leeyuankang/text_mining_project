location is great just a few short blocks from marble arch and the central line the breakfast room is bright and cheerful and the food selection is varied and good there are a dozen restaurants within a block or two many reasonably priced the staff were very helpful and friendly the rooms are reasonably sized for an old london hotel but don t expect american sized rooms
