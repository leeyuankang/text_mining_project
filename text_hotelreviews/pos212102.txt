the hotel was in a convenient location with easy access to the underground the hotel is very nice from the street and throughout the public areas with a very bright comfortable lounge i didn t have much interaction with staff other than check in check out so can t really comment on that aspect but from what i experienced they were quite pleasant the bed and pillows were comfortable but the duvet was strangely on the small side there were usb chargers in the room and for foreigner travellers adapters the towels were soft and fluffy breakfast was adequate usual b b fair they did serve a selection of different types of milk and as someone who doesn t drink cows milk it was very nice to see
