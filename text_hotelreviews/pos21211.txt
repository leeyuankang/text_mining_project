great fairly quiet location near tower bridge and the tower of london but close to underground station so less than mins to most attractions including shops ideal for exploring the locality and history of the city keepers restaurant within hotel was excellent and good value for money rooms have everything we wanted liked the free safety deposit box and hot shower staff very pleasant and always pleased to help second time we have stayed here so that in itself is a good recommendation
