lovely hotel room was a good size with a large comfy bed although near the road it was very quiet fridge in room but no kettle to make a hot drink but the staff are happy to supply you with complimentary hot drinks brought to your room complete with a biscuit the buffet breakfast was delicious and set you up for a days exploring spent nights at the hotel for my husbands birthday and it was ideally situated to do lots of sight seeing and within walking distance to many would definately return and recommend
