the sumner is in a great location marylebone neighborhood near hyde park and oxford street i stayed here for a days and was able to get around without any issues the marble arch underground station is a minute walk away there are also plenty of restaurants nearby as well the hotel itself is cozy and quaint and you ll literally wake up to the smell of bacon from the breakfast room downstairs with a good selection to start your day and super friendly staff the room isn t huge but has plenty of space for solo travelers or couples i stayed on the third floor at the rear of the building and the noise level outside and within the hotel was practically non existent after so you ll absolutely get the sleep you need the bathroom has all the amenities you d expect and the shower is one of the best i ve used in europe so far only small downside was no iron ironing board provided in the room i also have to mention that the hotel staff is exceptional in their service i had a minor dispute on my check out folio and they gladly corrected the issue while being back in the states i highly recommend this hotel for any first time travelers to london
