great location min to the hyde park airport bus stop and underground station it s a good base point for shopping on the oxford street and for london sightseeing at all the room was cosy and clean a breakfast was very tasty and with a large selection of food the hotel s staff is very helpful and pleasant as for me hotel despite being quite expensive was totally worth the money
