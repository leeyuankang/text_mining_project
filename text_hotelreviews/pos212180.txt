the staff were friendly and helpful i had booked a twin room but the room was set up as a double this was reorganised very quickly the room was large and comfortable tea is not provided in the room but a simple call and you have a fresh pot with real milk in no time at all in the lounge or your room the breakfast buffet was wholesome and filing everything you could wish for the front rooms were slightly noisy on the road the venue is perfect for shopping
