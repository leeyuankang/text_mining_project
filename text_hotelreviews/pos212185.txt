the staff was excellent my partner had a headache and they even provided us with paracetamol got complementary coffee in the rooom too we were allowed to stay until the next day and have a late check out this was very kind as we had gone to a ball the evening before the breakfast was also fantastic so much choice and really delicious the hotel is beautiful clean and very comfortable and in an amazing location near hyde park at the same time it was amazingly quiet we didnt hear anything from the streets we were in the top floor absolutely loved it we give our highest recommendations for this place and would love to come back to this hotel next time we re in london
