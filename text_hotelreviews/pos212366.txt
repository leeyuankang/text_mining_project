beautifully decorated very clean and comfy bed brilliant location just next to shepherds bush tube station the staff extremely helpful and polite along time since our luggage has been taken to our room for us and looked after after we had checked out so we could browse westfield shopping complex without having to drag our luggage around with us we would certainly stay at this little gem of a hotel again
