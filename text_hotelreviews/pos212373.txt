the bed was fantastic with crisp bedlinen and comfy pillows and the tv was great with fast guide the room is pretty small but good value for central london fantastic location right beside a tube stop and near a more major one on bus routes handy for portobello rd market and next to a lovely green perfect for the fabric shops of goldhawk road staff were warm and welcoming and helped with bags very useful as there s no lift and i was on the third floor it s on a busy road so take earplugs if that will be a problem for you there was an aircon in the room keeping it nice and cool in the london summer two minor niggles the shower temperature control was a bit hard to manage and a couple more coffee sachets might have been nice but overall near perfect i would definitely stay there again
