this is a simple room only affair no food or larger hotel type facilities but they do rooms very very well i ve stayed in most room types singles both doubles and all are very clean comfortable and quiet good sized bathroom tea coffee in the room along with a safe and good solid wifi too perfect for business and good for solo travellers too i ve stayed several times and the staff are very helpful and accommodating and the location is great next to shepherds bush underground highly recommended
