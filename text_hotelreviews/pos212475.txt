i liked everything about rooms other than the lack of an elevator very attentive and friendly staff shepherd s bush is west of central london but the hotel is a short walk to the underground and bus terminal and still zone underground all supplies were full bath towels large amenities nicely presented nothing i didn t like other than what i noted room has a classy feel with updated bath my wife and i felt that it was an excellent hotel and a good value we would stay here again and we ll recommend it to friends
