we stayed here to attend a concert in the empire theatre the location was fantastic for both the venue and the underground and overground train stations the staff were extremely helpful and courteous the room was beutifully decorated very clean and well equipped with all the necessities we also managed to squeeze in a bit of shopping due to the location beside westfield shopping centre i would highly recommend and will stay here again
