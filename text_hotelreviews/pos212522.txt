the hotel was quite deceiving from outside due to its small door entrance what welcomed me initially was a staircase however the walls going up were tastefully decorated and had a cozy clean warm colour the reception was right in front of the first landing a staff welcomed me straight away there was no lift but a staff helped carry my luggage after the very check in the room was small but had a fridge flat screen clothes rack and safe box it was very clean and had a welcoming fresh fragrance i really loved the toilet had a contemporary shower and the temperature of water can easily be set the room ovorlooked the vue and shopping mall on the left side was the shepherds bush tube station and behind it literally just a few steps away was the westfield shopping centre in spite of its proximity to the said landmarks and other ameneties as eating areas and tourist attractions the noise from outside did not wake me up from sleep the staff were friendly and accomodating the main hotel door was locked at late night and only the guests could enter using their room cards for all these positives i felt it was a good priced stay
