the room was small however perfect for what we needed our trip was to visit shepherd bush empire which was only a few minutes away perfect if you are going to a concert the staff were very helpful and always had a smile the room was clean free tea coffee and fresh bottles of water a good size bathroom and clean a small fridge and a working hairdryer
