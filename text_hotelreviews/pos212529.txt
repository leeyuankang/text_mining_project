efficient friendly and fast check in the room was very clean and everything was in perfect working order great hairdryer which is unusual in hotels although on a busy road it was well sound proofed so i slept very well and heard no traffic it is right next to shepherd s bush tube and close to the westfield shopping centre so great location staff were very friendly and i felt very secure in the room too
