this hotel gave me everything i wanted for my two night stay and its location next door to shepherds bush tube station is so convenient the staff are very charming and helpful my room was spacious i booked a superior double for single occupancy very attractively decorated and effectively sound proofed the hotel doesn t do breakfast but is surrounded by eating places i will certainly be back
