the hotel decor was very tasteful it was exceptionally well laid out rooms were very clean and bed was comfortable with crisp clean bedding shower room was luxurious i would recommend anybody travelling to london to give this a visit it is right next to shepherds bush underground and has many eateries with various price ranges on the door step and there is an excellent designer shopping centre behind the accommodation i could not rate this highly enough
