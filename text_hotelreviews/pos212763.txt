i wish i can remember my room number it was excellent it was located in an adjusted building facing the court yard i received it as a courtesy upgrade from the hotel because they had a messed up booking information from booking com in the hotel system my booking was one day ahead from my actual arrival i had a stressful flight the plain landed after the second attempt and on the way from the airport our taxi nearly missed the car crash at the tunnel so when i arrived to the hotel i was pretty much grumpy the reception staff was very patient during the messed check in multiplied by my emotions for which i am extremely greatful
