the breakfasts were delicious and the scrambled eggs were light and fluffy i travelled with my sister and we shared a club twin room for days the staff were excellent and offered us an upgrade owing to a maintenance issue with our booked room and also complimentary breakfast for our stay the bedroom was a good size on the floor and was lovely and clean and the bed linen of good quality the bathroom although small was refurbished with a good size soaking tub and a well fitting shower screen the bathroom towels were also of good quality although a little bit small there is plenty of hot water and the central air can be well controlled the location is excellent as it is only a short walk from paddington station so ideal for tourists catching the heathrow express and the tube connections from paddington are ideal we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and when i travel back to london with my husband and children we will definitely stay here again as you definitely get value for money
