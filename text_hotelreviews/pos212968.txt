the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful we were given and upgraded room which was well appointed but a bit dark it was very quiet and an ideal location for paddington station as it is only a few minutes to walk reception is a very small area but having negotiated a slightly later check out we were able to sit there and read the papers before we left for our function
