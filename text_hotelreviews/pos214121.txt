staff were good to help with directions etc polite friendly to me room was sparkling but shower dirty plenty of every day needs i e hairdryer toiletries tissues etc d cor good but room too small wasn t pleased but didn t have time to request changing room plus all staff were dealing with other guests complaints it would have been lovely if it had been the room which should have been allocated to me
