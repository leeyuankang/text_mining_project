very close once you find the exit from paddington station unpretentious outside but inside small lobby rooms were small its london but not too tiny but pretty nice classic dark mahogani style wood beds were soft bit still surprisingly comfortable we slept well breakfast had a good selection and thought its worth it clean rooms and friendly staff
