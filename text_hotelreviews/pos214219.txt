the staff were great and the rooms were very comfortable i was a solo traveller so in a single room the first visit was only one night and my room was quite small but very comfortable the second stay was for two nights and my room was bigger it is such a lovely area to be in in london so close to everything and only blocks from paddington station which runs the heathrow express making it an easy run to and from this airport
