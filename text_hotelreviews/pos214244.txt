as an extremely last minute booking i wasn t expecting much as for a london paddington hotel the room was an extremely good price but as soon as i was welcomed i felt right at home i had a double room with an en suite which was so cosey and look lovely the room had two large and small towels available as well as all the little luxury bathroom items it also had tea of coffee i the room and i safe which was available if you wanted to use it the staff were always on hand to help and nothing was ever too much for them i will definitely be returning to this hotel for both business and leisure trips i only wish i d had time for breakfast trip for me
