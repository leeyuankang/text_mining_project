the hotel is extremely clean quiet and in an excellent location if you like a good nights sleep but there are still excellent restaurants and bars on the doorstep the staff were very efficient and professional the room was a delight with a great design bathroom was the best we have ever seen with lovely toiletries good selection at breakfast and we liked the complementary tea and coffee throughout the day and then the honesty bar after would highly recommend
