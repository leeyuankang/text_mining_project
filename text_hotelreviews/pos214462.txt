lovely boutique hotel great location about minutes to notre dame and only a few minutes walk to a number of metro stations interior is very fresh a stylish fusion of traditional and contemporary decor beds and bedding are high quality and although you can sometimes hear the metro nearby it is not intrusive nice view over the amphitheatre at the back i believe there is a sauna for use by guests but we didn t find this out until we got there plenty of great bistros nearby worth a little walk up to place de la contrescarpe minutes west of the hotel nice bars and restaurants the museum of natural history and zoo m nagerie le zoo du jardin des plantes are about minutes east and worth a visit
