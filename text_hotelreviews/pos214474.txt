one of the best hotel experiences i ve ever had the service is extraordinary lukas and natalia went above and beyond to make sure that everything was taken care of they arranged show tickets and dinner reservations throughout the trip my luggage was lost by my airline when i arrived into paris the staff at the hotel helped me follow up with the airlines each day to see if they could help locate my luggage the location is absolutely perfect as well on a quite street but close to all of the attractions i highly recommend this hotel
