staff was very friendly and helpful room was very very clean and the size matched what was advertised coffe and tea in hotel were nice location is excellent because it takes walk to pantheon or to notre dame etc if one wants to use metro there are stations nearby hotel one just behind first corner from hotel second one and third is from hotel neighbourhood is quiet with some restaurants and caffes close to hotel there is also supermarket on the other side of the street
