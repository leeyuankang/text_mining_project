i love the location and the way that the place is designed and decorated the mattress was very comfortable and the size was excellent the tv was fab very big and a huge choice of channels the wifi is free too which is a nice bonus the molten brown items in the bathroom are a nice touch and the scent used in the hallways is beautiful i loved that the staff were very amenable too
