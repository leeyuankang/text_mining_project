despite the central london location the hotel was very quiet and perfectly situated for anyone like me who requires somewhere decent to stay the night after attending the late show and the late late show at ronnie scott s which is just a few yards away although a little small the single room in which i stayed was spotlessly clean had an extremely comfortable bed a large television on the wall at the foot of it which i didn t have time to use and a small adjoining washroom shower that can only be described as luxurious i didn t arrive at the hotel until and after having a quick drink at the bar i left for ronnie scott s at and didn t return until just after when i crawled into bed and slept like a log until my pre arranged wake up call at a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one i will be repeating in a couple of weeks when i m staying there again to attend a further late show and late late show at ronnie scott s i have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel to anyone who proposes to stay in this part of london either as a tourist or like me as someone whose function doesn t end until long after their last train has departed
