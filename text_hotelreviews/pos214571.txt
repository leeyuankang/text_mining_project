worst place in london unacceptable don t be misled to go there it has no star and is worse than a hostel you are charged to a deluxe double room which is sq m and not complains are not taken as the manager is always busy off course you are duly charged in advance so that you cannot opt out without waiting for a refund again never go there unless you are looking for a bed and not for a room
