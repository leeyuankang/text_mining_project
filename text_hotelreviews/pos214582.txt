what an absolute gem of a hotel smack in the centre of london we had a suite thank you mimi s which was perfect in every way this quirky boutique style hotel oozes character and style the staff are fabulous and the room was great from the d cor to the comfy mattress to the dimmable mood lights the bathroom was well equipped even had underfloor heating and heated mirror we were a little worried why they supplied earplugs on the bedside tables nice touch btw but we didn t need them we didn t eat or drink here just didn t have time but we re sure it would have been great i believe some of the rooms are a little compact but how much time do you really spend in the room when in london we can guarantee they are all spotlessly clean and well appointed besides look at the price then look at the location you couldn t get any better
