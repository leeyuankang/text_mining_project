great location surrounded by loads of restaurants and bars and very friendly staff the power shower was fantastic and free molton brown shower gels an added bonus initially i worried about the street noise greeted by what i thought was free mints but turned out to be free earplugs in the room although actually most street noise died down by or so i had a room with a window but in rooms this tiny with no window think i might have felt a bit claustrophobic
