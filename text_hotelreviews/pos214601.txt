they didn t charge me extra for finding me an alternative room after giving someone else me the room i had originally booked apparently the room i ended up with was larger than the one originally booked though given the size of the room i was given i find that virtually impossible to believe i did eventually get to sleep the bed was reasonably comfortable the bathroom had hot and cold water available
