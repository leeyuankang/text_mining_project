the bedroom we stayed in was perfect it was a suite room which really is a small standard sized bedroom but totally adequate i thankfully chose this room after reading many comments about how small the other rooms are thank god i did it was only about pounds more well worth it as the price for staying at this hotel is a real bargain compared to others in london the communal areas of the hotel were beautifully decorated with luxurious marble flooring throughout i cannot emphasise how much we loved our bathroom amazing they provided plenty high end toiletries and towels you really couldn t believe you were getting all this luxury for the price you were paying we will definitely be staying here again as it is in the heart of soho the staff were very polite and friendly
