rooms are small very small but opulent in terms of style quality and comfort think miniature boudoir bathrooms are a masterpiece of design with molton brown toiletries a nice bonus free water and earplugs a welcome touch the staff were friendly helpful and welcoming on check in and check out breakfast was really good just fresh coffee and a pastry but in lovely surroundings watching soho come to life the location is amazing bang in the heart of all that soho has to offer looking forward to staying again
