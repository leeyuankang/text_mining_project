i appreciated how they kept the dress i left in the room at the front desk until i was able to have a friend pick it up for me the evening staff were superb wish i could say the same about when i checked in the bar attendee was wonderful and the cleaning ladies were so sweet the room itself was okay just small the tv was a good addition location was ideal as it was in the middle of soho
