this has become my hotel of choice for doing business in london the staff are amazing the location is as good as you can possibly get right in the heart of soho and minutes from theatre land and fantastic bars and restaurants despite the central location the rooms are incredibly quiet and the beds among the most comfortable i have found anywhere to top it off the bar on the ground level is an absolute gem really cosy particularly if you get seated next to the fire with a great drinks list highly recommended
