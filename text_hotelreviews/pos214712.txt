loved the molton brown toiletries the room is a cute size some may describe it as small but great comfy bed and quality linen all details from hairdryer controllable air con tv phone to complimentary water but disappointedly no tea or coffee perhaps for h s reasons despite the size the finish of the room feels luxurious with lots of wooden panels very heavy doors marble and wood finish great rain forest shower the room was quiet and comfortable staff were welcoming and greeted us with a smile and a warm welcome
