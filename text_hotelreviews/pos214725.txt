this hotel delivers exactly what it says the rooms are compact read small but this is central london and it makes that clear in the hotel advertising so shouldn t be a surprise to anyone the fixtures and fittings are very high quality and everything in the room worked the layout of the room was functional and although comfortable for a one night stay i wouldn t want to be spending a huge length of time in the room but who would with soho on your doorstep the tv was a good quality samsung with all the channels free films and excellent free wifi available so even a bit of netflix was possible using a phone tablet or laptop the staff were very polite and the barman took great pride in his job with his quirky outfit and all up north we take our flat caps off indoors the bathroom was spotless with lovely molton brown products and the rain shower had plenty of pressure and hot water finally i ve gotta say this hotel was quiet the corridor doors are thick sound proofed affairs and the rooms appear to be heavily insulated temperature was comfortable and i got a great nights sleep even though the bustle of soho was right outside i will be doing this same trip every fortnight for the foreseeable future and i will be using mimi s again for my nighters
