i loved it there because of the hotel and the staff for starters and it is so convenient for oxford street and all around i have been there before but my husband hadn t and he kept on how lovely it was it was also great to get back after we had seen a show in the evening and to be able to get a meal it was also very quiet at night so able to sleep peacefully
