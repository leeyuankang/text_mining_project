we had a meal at the bar while waiting room to be made ready it was very ordinary indeed the room was not very comfortable two beds shoved together with only one small table between couldn t watch tv from the bed curtain difficult to close due to a shelf abutting window bathroom door stuck and had to be slammed to shut bath tub needs replacing with a shower bath narrow and too high a safety risk no bath cosmetics available either which is usually a standard these days
