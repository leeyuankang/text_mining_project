the hotel may be a bit far from the city center but it is very near subway stations different lines and there are bus stops right outside the hotel making it very easy to get around the hotel lobby is big and impressive the staff was friendly check in was fast and smooth our room was nice and comfortable with a view of shepherds bush park although we were on a main street our room on the floor was quiet by day and by night
