it was my stay at the hotel and once again i had a great time there staff is very friendly the room very nicely equipped with modern appliances and devices i had a really nice and clean room with a plenty of light and a nice small bathroom just big enough and i m not a small person i like this hotel also for its location there are multiple tube and bus stations around and even if there s a problem on any of the lines you can get there also there are so many places to shop and get some food around that there is absolutely nothing to worry about
