we booked this hotel as we used to live in the area and were very interested to see what they had done with the building the location is excellent and we decided to pay a bit more money for a four star hotel to treat ourselves to a nice weekend in london it started off well reception staff were courteous and we were able to access our room earlier than official check in the communal areas of the building were attractive and nicely laid out
