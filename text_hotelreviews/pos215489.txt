dorsett shepherd bush is not all that close to the city center however it has everything around it that you could need when you get back from the city center there are pubs a shopping center multiple fast food normal restaurants and a small grocery store nearby the hotel itself is of the trendy variety the staff is quite helpful if you need directions to from a locale the breakfast has a tremendous selection even though it was quite a bit reduced from our first visit to the hotel as many sites say it is a minute walk to the shepherds bush underground station this is true in front of the shepherds bush station there is a bus station that will take you to almost any part of london
