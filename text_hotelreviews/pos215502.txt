the hotel is in a good location it was only a couple of minutes to the westfield centre and a few more to the tube the room was a good size with a comfortable bed the receptionists were very polite and helpful i was on the sixth floor and the lift was really speedy i could not use my phone for some reason despite the free wifi but the guy on reception managed to get the internet for me
