the location of the hotel was great we walked for a lot of our trip and the surrounding area was lovely we were able to check in early and had an option of whether we wanted the front or back view we decided to go for the front and had a great view of the square it was lively buzzing during the weekend that said it wasn t terribly loud and during the evening it was fine
