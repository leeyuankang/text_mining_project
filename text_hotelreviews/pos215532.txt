the hotel has an interesting design and although it is not in the centre is very well connected with main attractions by bus the bus stop is just in front of the hotel bus runs to piccadilly in about minutes or underground lines it is just minutes walk from westfield shopping mall where you can find everything you need from food to clothes we had a deluxe dr facing the houses behind the hotel which was very quiet with comfortable bed and pillows the staff from the reception was very helpful we asked to change the room and they immediately provided another one
