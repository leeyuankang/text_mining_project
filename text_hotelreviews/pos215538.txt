the hotel foyer and public areas are particularly impressive on arrival and the overall impression was further boosted by the gentleman at reception who gave us an unexpected upgrade to a suite as the next day was our wedding anniversary and also mother s day this was inspired timing the suite was commodious beautifully decorated and very well equipped i particularly enjoyed the lavazzo coffee maker the tastefully appointed tea making facilities and the elegant bathroom with both shower and bath the toiletries were also of a very high standard i couldn t say enough good things about it the hotel is very well located about minutes walk from the westfield shopping centre with it marvellous selection of retail shopping and restaurants it is also convenient for both the shepherd s bush and the shepherd bush market tube station
