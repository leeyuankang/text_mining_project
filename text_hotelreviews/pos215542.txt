this hotel is really amazing our room and bathroom were super clean quiet and comfortable the staff is always smiling being helpful and always checking if you re ok or if you need something else wifi was always working and a plus for this hotel is that they offer a phone with connection so you can use while outside in the city yes you save money our experience staying in dorsett was the best it could possibly be and in the future if i return to london i would definitely stay there again it is interesting to highlight that the bedroom and bathroom are really equipped with solutions for disability and emergency
