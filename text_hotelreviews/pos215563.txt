the staff were so helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble even when helping us to understand the underground we were made to feel special from the moment we arrived we received a complimentary upgrade and a nice welcome card with some chocolate brownies in the room there is also a complimentary phone to use that has while travelling around london which is great as you then don t eat into your own data allowance there is also a handy underground guide on there which was helpful the cocktails were lovely from the bar make sure you take advantage of happy hour
