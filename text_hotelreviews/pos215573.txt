i think this is the best hotel i have stayed at in london at this price category so far the room was bright modern clean and big especially for london it had a small fridge coffee and tea to prepare if wanted a safe a proper work desk fast wifi and a real very good hair dryer as well and the usual ironing equipment which i did not use the bed was big and very comfortable the staff was friendly and helped me out with documents i needed printed within a wink of an eye i booked it to attend an event at the next door shepherd s bush empire and it was ideal for that the city center oxford circus is easy and quick to reach with the near by central line there are also bus stops all round the hotel but i did not use a bus i would book it again any time
