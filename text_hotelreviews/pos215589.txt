wow what a beautiful stay i had at this hotel recently i ve been traveling so much and stayed in different star hotels and i can easily say that this hotel deserves more than starting from check in to the check out very nice and clean room very comfortable bed room service and breakfast good selection tasty food yummy breakfast great coffee haven t tried the restaurant as its a lot of choice out of the hotel but i m sure it s good too in my opinion the gym could be slightly bigger but still better than nothing shame i haven t had time to try their spa hopefully next time if i m staying with them i will definitely try it out i also liked the little decor on the door little birds it s really cool makes the hotel design look special nice and well trained staff especially the management very friendly and professional big thank you to sabir tahir he made my stay even better as he was able to sort out a little issue i had with room service delivery great job guys keep doing what you doing the best
