i was going to a gig at the empire so the location was perfect on arrival they didn t have the room i wanted so offered me free breakfast to make up for it it was a nice offer but the breakfast queue was out of the door so i didn t bother it was all comfortable enough and the staff were very friendly the toiletries were nice
