the hotel is very smart and oozes quality on first impressions the bed was sumptuous and the linen crisp and clean the reception and bar area are very attractive the staff on reception were reasonably courteous complimentary coffee in the bar area was a nice touch surely a coffee dispenser in the restaurant would be better than every table having to ask for hot drinks at breakfast
