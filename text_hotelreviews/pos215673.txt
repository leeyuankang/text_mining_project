it was such an fabulous stay the rooms was super clean and comfy and the pillows are soft and the settings in the bedroom was nice and cozy and give you a warm feeling we have also used the facilities of the spa in the hotel it was nice but i would recommend to have your appointment in the afternoon as when you ve finished your session you could lay down and see over the view and relax whereas at night it was kind of dark out there nothing much the reception helped us a lot as we need to print out our flight schedules but the printer was not working properly at the business centre and therefore they are really kind to help us to print them out the lobby was nice with cozy chairs and it give you an artistic feeling the staff remembers who you are as we left some baggages and flew off to elsewhere for a short trip the staff are super nice
