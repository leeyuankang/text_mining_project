we absolutely loved staying at this place and actually cancelled another accommodation that we booked in london to come back to stay at dorsett the beds are super comfortable the rooms are clean and nicely decorated the staff are professional and friendly and the tv has all the channels you need to stay entertained a giant shopping mall is literally around the corner from the hotel so it s heaven if you re into shopping i d highly recommend this place and we wouldn t stay anywhere else next time we re in london
