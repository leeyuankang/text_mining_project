booked a double room for nights asked for a twin room at check in and they obliged yayy the location is near different tube lines with many cafes restaurants and even grocery shops nearby the westfield shopping mall will have everything that you would need the room is snug but large enough to lay out suitcases air conditioned kettle cups fridge hair dryer provided wifi was good the bathroom was excellent one of my pet peeves are shower areas that do not contain water well with the floor ending up wet and slippery no matter how you contort in the shower the shower stall was well thought out and constructed and i absolutely loved not having the floor wet when my friend have used it the beds were ok but the pillows were a bit soft
