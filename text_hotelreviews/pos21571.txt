excellent hotel well located metro outside the door and only mins walk from notre dame if you prefer indeed walkers will find it good for many sites we had a quiet room and really pleased we included breakfast as it was excellent with nice fresh croissant and great cooked options concierge very helpful ask for their recommendations of where to have dinner locally
