i was able to request a room with an accessible shower this was ideal for my specific needs with a firmly anchored seat that could be folded down when needed and did not get in the way when not the staff were always helpful when i had a problem or request i have had to make several stays in this area recently while my wife was in hammersmith hospital and this is the hotel i liked best among those i tried pricier than some but i was able to get some good discounts by booking ahead
