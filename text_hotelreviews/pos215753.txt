the staff were excellent polite and informative the concierge helped me with some onward travel questions and organised storage and called maintenance to help fix a bag of ours damaged from our flight the maintenance guy andy was a real gentleman and helped us fix the bag up before our next flight the room was well appointed and very comfortable and quiet the staff really made the experience worthwhile i think that with so many hotels around the details make a difference thank you to everyone at the dorsett
