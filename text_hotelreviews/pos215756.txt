a superb hotel the staff were delightful the room was wonderful the bed comfortable the shower outstanding and it was so quiet we stayed two nights breakfast provided a huge choice in both cooked and continental and the dinner menu was extensive we have never strayed far from central london when booking accommodation but the dorsett hotel was well worth the easy journey and was so much better value for money
