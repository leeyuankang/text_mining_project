just around the corner from the tube station so access to everywhere used this hotel as a base for london film comic con at the olympia but just used taxis to commute there back very helpful staff who arranged a twin room for us even though that option wasn t there when booking after a flight delay late arrival to the hotel reception arranged room service for us which was very welcome as we were just there to use it as a base for two nights i can t offer much opinion on the hotel facilities but our room was very clean comfortable beautiful ensuite
