when we arrived we were met with a big smile and a very friendly welcome our room was out of this world very plush and very large beautiful decoration every comfort you could wish for the bathroom was well appointed with two towel bathrobes which were very handy the bed was a dream on which to dream on the staff were more than helpful and were only too willing to help book tickets for shows and for sight seeing trips which we loved the area in which the hotel was situated was lovely and there was a bus stop right outside which took you right into piccadilly which we used more than once getting a wonderful tour of london all they way there is also a tube station right round the corner which is very handy for anyone planning a trip to london i would highly recommend this hotel it is a little bit outside the center but london has so many centers but its value comfort and excellent staff make it a very worthwhile choice and really your only around ten minutes by tube from anywhere you want to go go ahead try it you will not be dissapointed
