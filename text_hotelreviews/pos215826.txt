every staff member had a smile and were very friendly and approachable our room appeared a little small as we were on the floor overlooking the green great view but this was due to the curved windows of the front which reduces head height in our opinion it improved an otherwise standard square box room and would request it again the breakfast was amazing as was the fast wifi and sky tv too
