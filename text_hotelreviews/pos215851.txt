the hotel is gorgeous and very quiet while in the heart of the city the room was comfortable and the bed was honestly the best bed in which i ve ever slept in a hotel the hotel restaurant is also well worth the visit chinese gastronomy is rare in the city the hotel staff was very helpful and welcoming i would go again
