we were very lucky to find this hotel it is just perfect for holidays in london the staff was very kind and very professional since the first moments after the experiences i had before in london i didn t expect the room to be much but to our surprise the room was absolutely beautiful very clean very nice bright colours white and gold with a great view from the sixth floor also a kettle is there tea hot chocolate coffee maker bathrobe even the bathroom was fully equipped so in case you would but hopefully not lose a bag or forget to pack something everything is there ready for you they definitely do deserve those four stars very modern and luxury also shepherd s bush is a great location you have everything you need there a plenty of shops three underground stations nearby to get into centre or wherever you need to go also westfield is just behind a corner couldn t be better very recommended
