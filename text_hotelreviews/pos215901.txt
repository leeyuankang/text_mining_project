hotel is lovely the decor is very nicely done the room was very clean the bed was extremely comfy i didn t want to get out of it and the shower was great we were on floor and it was very quiet we didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurants excellent location mins from tube station stones throw from westfields shopping centre which was great
