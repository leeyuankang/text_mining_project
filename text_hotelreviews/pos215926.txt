very good location for transport with car parking looks as though has been completely refurbished and rooms and main areas very bright and clean with good shower and toiletries has on site bar and restaurant plus a corridor to an attached chinese has some rooms that face internally into a floor to ceiling atrium which means that no road noise at night very good value overall and would definitely recommend
