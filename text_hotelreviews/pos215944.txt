hotel seemed brand new one staff member told me hotel is years old but it seemed like it was opened only yesterday every part of hotel is classy very spacious in lobby with several armchairs scattered mostly at sides you can sit here and yet be in privacy due to such large lobby when everybody walks past they are far from you that you still have privacy separate bar area and plush comfortable armchairs here which is in central atrium that opens up through central core of building some room windows look directly out into this atrium note when you get to your room look out window and see if you can see glass roof at top of building then you ll know where your room is and not looking out onto street the peoples voices murmer you hear at night is this bar area below and not street but bar closes around midnight so this area is quiet during the night when your room heavy curtains are open you must realise that the others rooms opposite are looking directly at you too there are net curtains on window so you re not completely exposed very fast lifts take about seconds to go from ground floor to floor you hold room plastic key in front of sensor of lift controls and then press lift floor button to get lift moving instruction on stand in several languages outside lift doors on ground floor i have to mention that all the staff i met throughout hotel are very pleasant polite helpful and efficient its does make the stay more comfortable great selection of food at breakfast which was buffet when breakfast time was over waiting staff came around and suggested we take extra food as they were clearing away dinner was presented as any star restaurant bed was very comfortable and very soft pillows too radio with ipod dock on bedside table spotless and new bathroom small bottle of toiletries shampoo etc
