the room was modern and a good size lift access to the rooms was good and you don t have to wait long which is just as well as we couldn t find any stairs the location is fab the huge westfield shopping centre is just round the corner with lots of places to eat and drink on the doorsetp it is also very close to the train station and the buses stop outside the front door of the hotel i would stay here again
