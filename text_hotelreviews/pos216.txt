the hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on oosterpark which is awesome the location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and mins to poi convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city you can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about very clean room made and towels changed everyday almost perfect
