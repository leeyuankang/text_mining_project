i decided to stay at the dorsett due to attending a concert in the shepherd s bush and was absolutely amazed and so impressed at the hotel it is basically the building right next to the academy which was extremely handy for after the show when we were all tired and just wanted to relax took no longer than a minute to walk back room service was amazing the quality of the food is spot on and the service staff are exceptional beds were extremely comfy not a single complaint and will be coming back would definitely recommend staying here if visiting london especially attending a concert at the shepherd s bush
