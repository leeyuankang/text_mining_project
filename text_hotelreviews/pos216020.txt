i chose the dorsett because of its proximity to shepherds bush empire and was as such very happy with the location it didn t even take a minute to reach the venue very convenient for when the concert had ended the staff was very professional and welcoming although there was some confusion about the screening of my card at check in facilities and rooms were impeccably clean and nicely furnished
