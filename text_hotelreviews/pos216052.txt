the staff were absolutely amazing myself and my sister have a nut allergy which i had informed them of before our stay when we went to eat in the restaurant they brought out the allergy booklet and went through each of our dishes individually to make sure that we were safe spa was great after a massage the relaxation room with complimentary tea topped it off nicely their dim sum is to die for and again they checked for nuts with each dish for us i can t wait to stay again
