the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was quite small there was a third bed in the room which was quite unnecessary and made it very cramped our double bed was pushed up against the wall in one side which was also difficult the bathroom was okay but there was no bath mat or shower curtain so the floor got quite wet and was very slippery continental breakfast was good the hotel is in a quiet street so we could have the window open and sleep
