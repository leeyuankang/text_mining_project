everything was great the staff was really nice the breakfast was good and our room and hotel was really clean yes as expected the room was a bit small but we went to explore london not just stay in our room so we were okay with that good location with nearby stops for buses big bus tours restaurants and caf s also if needed i recommend booking airport service with the hotel
