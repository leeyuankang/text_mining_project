for the average london price quality offer it is a good place the room is small but clean if they would remove the huge tea set from the table it would actually give space to put things on the table equally unnecessary the beauty blanket on bed noone needs it and there is nowhere to put it away the staff is kind and friendly check in fast and easy breakfast for the fact that it is included a good one enough choice to eat there during a city trip coffee though could be better read stronger and have coffee taste sry for a short stay i would book it again as i refuse to pay the ridiculous prices london hotels ask
