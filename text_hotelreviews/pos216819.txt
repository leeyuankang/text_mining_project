we enjoyed the new linden the lowest price room was very cramped as with so many similar london hotels we asked to upgrade for the rest of our stay and were given an excellent room staff transferred our clothes while we were out and were generally very helpful close by were several good restaurants so we could have a pre theatre meal there before heading for theatre land much less stressful and better quality than the west end would recommend this plan to anybody in l london for a show
