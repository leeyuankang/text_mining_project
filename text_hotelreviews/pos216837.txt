loved this hotel we booked mainly on price as just wanted a cheap cheerful getaway but seem to have uncovered an absolute gem of a place we loved it so much that we actually extended our stay by an extra night the staff were absolutely lovely and so helpful and the location was perfect for us we will definitely be booking again for our next trip to town
