great location for exploring this part of london the hotel is situated in a quiet square within walking distance of public transport and many attractions all was tastefully decorated clean and the staff were friendly and accommodating whilst our room was not overly spacious it was very comfortable and had everything that we needed the facility to leave our luggage after checking out meant that we could make the most of our time in the area we would definitely consider staying here again
