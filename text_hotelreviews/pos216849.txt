i stayed here during an workaction in the end of january i stayed in a suite on the ground floor and the room was very spacious i would recommend to choose a suite instead of a standard room if you want more space there was a kettle so one could make tea coffee in the room the staff was very friendly the breakfast was ok not very much to choose from but there was bread ham cheese eggs yogurt etc the location is perfect and the neighborhood is lovely different subways nearby bayswater notting hill gate and queensway which gives you access to almost all lines with maximum one change very easy to get there from victoria station and paddington walking distance to portobello road and kensington gardens nice restaurants in the area and a sainsbury close by i will definitely consider this hotel for future stays and i also recommended it to friends with a few changes it will be perfect
