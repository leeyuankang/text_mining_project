i love the location for the new linden its easy to walk to really good restaurants both right near the hotel and a tiny bit further on westbourne grove it is also close to portobello road and notting hill i think the staff is great and the management does its best to accommodate all good the rooms and bathrooms are clean and downstairs the breakfast is well managed a pretty good the first time i stayed in the new linden now i have stayed there times i found the air a bit stuffy and smelled of some kind of air freshener but didn t notice this in my most recent stay
