it is close to bayswater underground station so it is easy to get to anywhere in the city the room was small but enough for a three night stay and it was cleaned every day properly they did not skimp the heating so much so we had to turn it down in the middle of the night breakfast was better than expected the neigbourhood is very nice and tidied
