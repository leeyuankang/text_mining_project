the location was perfect for us the room a little small but spotlessly clean and had all the required amenities all the staff were helpful and polite and we will definitely stay there again close to portobello rd market bayswater tube station and great pubs and restaurants and if you get the chance eat in a little pizza place called mullberry st pizza on moscow rd vfm
