we stayed in two different rooms because we we had another person join us later in our trip the first room was a basic room with two twin beds put together it was small as expected in europe the second room was a family suite room and it was amazing i loved it spacious and beautiful i wanted to stay there much longer just to enjoy the room staff was very friendly and so helpful with all kinds of information to make our stay in london wonderful
