the hotel is situated in a quiet area but only a few streets away there is an array of public houses restaurants and shops and close to a tube station the hotel maintains a high standard of cleanliness and my husband and i enjoyed the continental breakfast on offer the only down side was we did not get chance to chill out on the lovely decking area at the rear of the hotel perhaps next time
