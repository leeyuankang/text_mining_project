we booked this hotel for carnival but had booked the room accidentally for the day ahead the receptionist was very helpful and changed the dates for us as we checked in she even upgraded the room and put us in the honeymoon suite for no additional cost room was very nice had a jacuzzi bath with sexy lightening and a balcony large variety of food for breakfast it is a continental breakfast though bed felt like heaven i would definitely come back if i am back in london again
