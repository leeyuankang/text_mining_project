the courtesy of the hotel staff were great when we arrrived at the hotel we were told that our room was unavailable due to a boiler failure which was a bit of a disappointment but the hotel staff were great and we were told we would be upgraded and receive complimentary breakfast great customer service on the hotels behalf i would definitely stay again the next time we were to visit london
