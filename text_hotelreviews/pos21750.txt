rooms very clean the staff was very nice i didn t like that when i got there the price was completely different than what booking com told me it would be it was considerably more to be fair the management agreed to charge me only what the booking com price was but i don t understand the initial discrepancy it is nice they give you cell phones for free to use while you are there
