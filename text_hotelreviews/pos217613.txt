we loved everything the property the location the attentive service the breakfast the hotel was super friendly for our toddler who loved walking around and saying hello to everyone the staff was super patient and kind and you could see the star training in the way they helped with everything including getting a doctor to come to see the baby in our room and charging the cost to the room since we did not yet have euros in hand and you can t beat the location in the arrondisement this is surely our new favorite
