i have stayed here three times in the last two years this hotel has a fabulous boutique feel and is close to prime shopping it is very easy to walk to most attractions in central paris the design is sleek and clean yet not stuffy breakfast is excellent the staff is very friendly and accommodating i particularly love all the doormen i will return here many times
