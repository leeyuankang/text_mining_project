i am rearly writhing a review but this hotel worth it i ve stayed before in other stars paris hotels and some was great but crazily expensive others just good with acceptable prices but this one combines both i guess that manager of this hotel should be a perfectionist everything is on a place everything created with a thought of beauty and comfort truly star hotel totally recommend
