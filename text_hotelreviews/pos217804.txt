my husband and i stayed at the hotel for nights we arrived on a early morning flight n were at the hotel at am and were welcomed with a fantastic junior suite the normal check in time is the staff was extremely gracious kept our room ready for us the location is top notch for people looking to shop all brands r on the same street just a few mins walk away the eiffel tower is a min walk the hotel is small clean and service is very quick the lobby area is more like a lounge with comfortable couches and a cozy fireplace the housekeeping was great they also have a limited room service menu i would recommend the club sandwich and nothing else really but if ur hungry and it s outdoor the food is more than decent we didn t have a coffee machine in our room but we could order coffee as many times a day as we pleased free of charge there are also a few cafe s around the area however these are quite pricy l avenue is a must try remember to reserve before you go for the simpler days we chose to go to a carrefour express that was a min walk away fresh yogurt and croissants were available we had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back
