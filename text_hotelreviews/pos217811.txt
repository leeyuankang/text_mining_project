the best location for shopping most designerbrands are in walking distance on the same street of the hotel also the famouse champs elys es is in minutes walk if you stand on avenue montaigne you can see the eiffel tower the hotel staff are very helpful although the hotel is not classic french decorations style but it is modern clean and simple the price is very reasonable in this location
