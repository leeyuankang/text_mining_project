the location is great this is a main advantage of this hotel we have been guests of this hotel several times already due this reason this time due to our request for the room on the silent side we have been located in very small and dark room when we wanted to open the window all the restaurants smell enter to us in the bathroom we had very noisy wentilator the restaurant recommendation from concierge was a disaster to summary i m not sure if we will back again
