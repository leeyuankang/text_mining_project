the staff made it amazing they were accommodating when we arrived giving a welcoming that is to be desired the staff were patient and helpful with all our questions even helping us understand the maps and marking down our plans on them there was no feelings of being rushed through any of the process from check in that left everyone approachable which is important and as one was busy another person would hop out take take of others and another would hop out of the office to as though they are just ready to help people the impression did not wane even to the day of check out they were helpful as the first impression to paris they set the tone right
