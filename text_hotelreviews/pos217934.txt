everything was superb from the premium room with added comforts and amazing soundproofing to the delicious choice of breakfast being able to park the car undergound in a secure car park was incredibly helpful all the staff were very friendly and and our special request to be able to leave our car in the car park for more than the hours we paid for at no extra charge just added that extra care which made our stay just perfect
