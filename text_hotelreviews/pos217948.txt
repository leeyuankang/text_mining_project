the receptionists were really nice and helpful rooms were quiet they have double windows so when the windows are closed you don t hear any noise from the traffic and the bed was very comfortable and big for us the location was perfect as it was very close to the train stations gare de lyon and austerlitz around mins walk they don t have a restaurant but the restaurant next door serves really good food
