the staff were wonderful very helpful they were very patient and were fluent in english i could not find fault i would love to go back we forgot our plug adaptors and they were more than happy to lend us some they have a lock on their front door to make the hotel safe and so not just anybody can walk in i feel extremely safe here the rooms are clean and very comfortable
