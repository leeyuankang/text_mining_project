the staff was extremely accommodating my travel plans changed and i arrived two days early the web site said it was fully booked but when i contacted them directly a room was available from that moment on the service was just top notch my first room was extremely comfortable in the old english manor style and i can t say enough about the beds super comfortable my second room was the teresa suite omg was it fantastic i felt like the lord of the manor i could not have been happier with my choice of hotel close to everything
