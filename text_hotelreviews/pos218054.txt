the charm of this place along with the delightful staff make it hard to beat i design houses so the spirit of this former private residence speaks to my aesthetic sensibilities i have stayed in two types of rooms and i would recommend booking larger rooms if you want more space though both were charming the morning breakfast of smoked salmon and tea was a great start to the day i would say choose a room on the back side as the street while quiet by day is a bit loud at night due to the many pubs and theaters nearby
