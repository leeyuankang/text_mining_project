we stayed here for two nights in the madam kennedy room floor celebrating our anniversary it is a very special hotel steeped in history which we both loved the huge bed was really comfortable even though it was very high to get up on to i m a shorter person would find it a big problem it had a firm mattress which was great as i suffer with a bad back the shower and bath were great very powerful shower over the bath friendly helpful staff who were always on hand if needed we were offered complimentary tea coffee and beautiful tasty florentin biscuits when we arrived and were seated in the cosy lounge room very atmospheric as is the whole hotel thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone who needs a great place to stay in this fab location
