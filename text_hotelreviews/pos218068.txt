from start to finish each person i had the opportunity of meeting at hazlitt s was exceptionally friendly and helpful even the workers that were doing a bit of remodeling during the day could not have been more polite i was allowed to check into my room a bit earlier than expected but while i waited for that confirmation i was treated to the most delicious cappuccino and biscuits i feel the necessity of mentioning my housekeeping maid mary by name she was absolutely delightful to chat with and kept my room in an impeccable state upon my checkout she was so thorough that before i had even left the property she had opened a drawer next to the bed and discovered that i had left one of my phones behind scurrying downstairs she made sure i had it in my hands before my taxi even had time to arrive i couldn t be more grateful and i had the feeling from everyone else working at hazlitt s that i would have received the exact courtesy no matter what my need the front desk staff in particular were absolutely lovely in every instance particularly kind to my friends who had the good fortune to visit me at the hotel during my stay everything about my recent stay exceeded my expectations and i will be sure to return hopefully much more soon than later my most sincere thanks to all who were so friendly and welcoming
