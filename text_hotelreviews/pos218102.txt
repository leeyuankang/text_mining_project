the staff were extremely helpful and were able to fulfill each request we had each room was unique and we loved the quirkiness of the room and the hotel as a whole it was a fairly easy walk to many of the places we wanted to see located in a lively neighborhood plenty of good restaurants within walking distance the hotel was secure our room was small but well appointed if you like big and impersonal hotels this is not for you but if you prefer unique and personal we highly recommend
