stayed for my husband s birthday excellent location as we spent the evening and the following day in soho and covent garden we had a buck fizz breakfast and the complimentary birthday cupcake was lovely we loved the fact that hotel has a very long interesting history behind it and it felt like we were sleeping in a room of a museum
