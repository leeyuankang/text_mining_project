i booked this hotel to celebrate my mum s birthday and booked months in advance with a very small request i e a little surprise in the room on arrival and also i booked a twin room i made my request through booking com and i reconfirmed by reservation with the hotel days before and they said everything was noted and would be accomadated for on arrival the staff were friendly and the hotel entrance was impressive but when i was talking to the checking staff i was then told that the little surprise for my mum would not be ready in the room when we arrived in the room it was lovley but unfortuntley it was not the room we had booked as this was a double bed and not a twin bed so i went back down to check in and they said they would get housing keeping to sort this out the maid who came didn t understand what to do and looked extremley exhausted and tired so i helped her to split the bed and make the bed up as twin beds as i felt quite sorry for her also the bathroom there was a sliding door you had to move to go into the toilet and shower this was extremely heavy to move i did ask the maid how to move it and she demonstated at holding one end of the door and just push very difficult especially for my mum by now i couldn t be bothered to go back downstairs and complain as this was for my mum birthday the little suprise that should of been in the room was delivered later in the day while we were in the room so the surprise was not really as i planned it i would like to say the breakfast staff were excellent especially jennifer who was so friendly and knowing it was my mum s birthday organised something with the chef for my mum this was so sweet of her great customer service excellent memeber of staff should be awarded a reward and recognition for her hard work and great customer service overall the hotel was lovley the pool and sauna was clean and the gym was well equipped with up to date equipment
