i liked that even though we couldn t check in until and we had arrived at we were allowed to use the pool and spa facilities until our room was ready the staff were lovely and the hotel was imaculately clean we chose to walk from kings cross to the hotel so we could take in the sights not once did we use a tube or bus or taxi really close to london eye which we had tickets for and also not a bad walking distance from the theatre at the savoy where went to see a show breakfast was great lovely and fresh and plenty of choice we went down at nearly expecting it to be really busy with nothing left but we were seated atraight away and there was staff filling up the buffett breakfast all the time overall we really enjoyed our stay and would deffinately book this hotel again
