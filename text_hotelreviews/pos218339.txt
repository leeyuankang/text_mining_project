i m a reasonably seasoned traveler but this hotel gave me several very pleasant surprises when i checked in at the end of a somewhat stressful day it was a great surprise to get a free upgrade to a king studio room the room was superbly appointed right down to wine glasses slippers and a bathroom scale and the in room technology surpassed anything i ve ever experienced everything operating from very intuitive touch pads make sure you try the mood lighting and enjoy the electronic blinds the service at very single point front desk restaurant concierge was exceptional the restaurant food was great and the location is great i highly recommend this hotel
