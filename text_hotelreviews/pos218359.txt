eventhough i thought it was quiet expensive to stay at this hotel i was very impressed with it from a hotel point of view and also it s location the hotel was spotless stayed in a similar priced hotel in brighton after this stay and it was a totally different experience sadly i would definitely stay here again the next time i am in london and would definitely recommend it to anyone
