this hotel is new and very modern and comfortable the location so near to waterloo station was a bit of a worry but the hotel is very quiet and we never heard a train it is across a crossroads from north lambeth tube station and on several major bus lines so it was very easy to get around london you can also easily walk to the thames near westminster bridge and the london eye the staff was professional pleasant and helpful and the buffet breakfast is terrific there is a very nice pool and spa
