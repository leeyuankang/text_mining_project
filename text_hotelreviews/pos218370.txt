the property is walking distance from big ben westminster london eye and the tate britain and tate modern so we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and do in london the rooms are modern and very clean with very comfy beds and pillows much better than other hotels we stayed on our trip highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something in central london as it is close to most tourist attractions and the tube station is just across the road
