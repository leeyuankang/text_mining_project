we loved the view we got a lucky room at the floor the room has big windows so you can enjoy the scenery it s very close to the tube and bus station but you can also get to the westminster bridge in minutes by foot we also got lunch one time it was very good it s not expensive and the staff were nice the best part of the room were the touch controls for the window shutter air conditioning and lights you did not have to hang a do not disturb clean the room sign you had a special button to signal those needs however they cleaned the room daily so you should not worry about it breakfast is very good lots of options but it is the same every day it could use some variation from time to time
