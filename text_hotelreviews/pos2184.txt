as extensive travelers this was by far the best experience we have ever had as a family the jr suite was so comfortable with two kids in europe it is almost impossible to find comfort for a reasonable price they provided great wifi along with a complimentary cell phone to use while we were there the breakfast was hearty and delicious the staff was super courteous the rooms were modern and clean we could walk to hyde park in minutes along with some great pubs within walking distance i cannot say enough great things
