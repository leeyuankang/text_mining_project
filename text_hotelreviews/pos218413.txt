the hotel was brand new with a quite modern design rooms were nice and clean although a bit small but considering we were in the downtown it was ok all the same the position of the hotel is excellent minutes walking from westminster bridge and from lambeth north underground station break fast is very well served with international dishes of a good level although with a bit cahotic organization anyway the waiters are super kind and compensate that
