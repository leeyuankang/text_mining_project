we travelled with our two children the hotel is just fantastic the rooms look great very modern no curtain but a button to pull down a black out blind which worked a treat our super king bed was very comfy the kids shared the sofa bed which i would say is not comfortable for an adult to use but the kids were happy with it staff were fantastic with the kids goodie bags on arrival plaza dollars to get treats into he cafe the best bit is breakfast in a family friendly area with kids tv and games breakfast was so calm it was great literally out of the hotel and min walk to lambert north just be careful there is another park plaza just around the corner our taxi took us there first for adults minus kids the walk to the london eye southbank will be minutes
