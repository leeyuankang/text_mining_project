the location was perfect minutes from lambeth north underground which gives great access for getting all over london the room was great with lots of mod cons and a fancy control panel to work them all at check in the lady on reception asked why we were travelling i explained it was our anniversary weekend and when we arrived back at the room after being out for the day we recieved a knock at the door and they had brought us a bottle of prosecco a dessert platter and a card wishing us a happy anniversary which was a lovely personal touch the prosecco was lovely
