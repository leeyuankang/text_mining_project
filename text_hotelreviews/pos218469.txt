the hotel upgraded us to another room for free because it was my partners birthday they also came to our room with a free bottle of wine the atmosphere and the staff were amazing they were so helpful and so friendly the location was great everything was walking distance i would definitely recommend this hotel and i would definitely return here i would also suggest getting breakfast included in your stay as we did perfect hotel for couples too
