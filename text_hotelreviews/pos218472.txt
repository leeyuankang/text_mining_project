extremely modern and comfortable hotel staff were eager to please with good attention to detail our tv remote was out of batteries but that was resolved within minutes even though it was late at night great breakfast and very cool bar made for a great stay super close to the tube from lambeth north on the bakerloo line made trips into the centre a breeze
