everything about this hotel was on point the staff were so welcoming even before i got to the door it was valentines day and i was offered a cookie and a mini bottle of prosecco on arrival everything was explained to me perfectly the hotel is beautiful the room was fantastic and i have nothing that i think could be better i am not used to the posh life so this was a definite treat and i can t wait to come back
