bed was very comfy staff in the bar were extremely helpful the hotel has a very nice vibe relaxed and family friendly the lounge space was very well laid out around the bar and enabled my group of six to chat easily the bathrooms were very cleverly designed and the room was great despite being less than metres from the waterloo train tracks i heard no rail noise at all nice thick windows remote controls for everything in the room and the electric blind were nice features the breakfast was a really good buffet style and the dining room was very relaxed and well laid out even when busy it didn t seem cramped
