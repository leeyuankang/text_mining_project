enjoyed a lovely meal couldn t fault it ox cheek with truffles the meat was beautiful so tender and the truffles added that extra flavour as well as a luxurious feel to the dish to top it off i also had the chocolate moose with pecans and caramel sauce which complimented the main course the staff at the park plaza have been courteous and welcoming informing me of their brand new facilities only opened months ago impeccable service would definitely recommend it to friends family and my followers just when you need that break enjoy the spa and pool which i did or even if it s a business trip or a romantic getaway
