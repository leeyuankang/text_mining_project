the location is very good because you can walk to the westminister embankment to take pictures of the big ben and the london eye the distance is around minutes it is not long as you get carried away looking the views whilst you walk when arrived to the big ben area you can then proceed walk the whole london such as the piccaddly circus where the m ms and lego shop is and then soho chinatown for food etc the hotel inside is very pretty and the rooms too have funky lighting such as full light where the room is bright moody lighting which is a little romantic with a blue neon lighting wall or just go pitch black to sleep also have a tv too that we listened to music everynight until we fell asleep have basic needs like towels soaps robes shower cap has a gym and a spa but i didn t go because no time also a bar and a resturant the price for nights roughly pounds for people so per night it is london and it was near central so it was an appropiate price free wifi too
