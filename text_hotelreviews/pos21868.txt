loved the connecting rooms we had our own door with our own private hallway and then our rooms were off the hallway each bedroom had enough room with their own bathroom coffee machine tv and own bathroom beds were super comfortable decor lovely our rooms had usb plug in s so no need for adaptors and for people coming from the uk they had uk plugs in the wall s so need for a travel adaptor staff were helpful and super friendly great location with lots of good cafes and restaurants nearby also great for shopping a most stay couldn t recommend more
