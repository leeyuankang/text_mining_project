had never stayed at a citizen m hotel before and though very contemporary and certainly different to hilton it was nonetheless very refreshing with a good outdoor space to watch the world and drink wine or coffee the best thing about the hotel was the staff extremely friendly and helpful and plentiful such nice people also our room despite being opposite the lift always a worry was ultra quiet we never heard anyone above or next door so superior was the sound proofing i know the room is full of the huge bed but my gosh it was comfy one of the best hotel beds i have slept on possibly not for everyone but we loved it and we wil definitely stay again a converted citizen
