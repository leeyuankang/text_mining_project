this is an amazing hotel if you are into something a little different it reminds me of something you d find in japan small rooms but they are super smart and for us who had large suitcases and golf clubs we made it work we love shoreditch area for food and really easy access to the trains staff were really friendly we stayed for nights and it was great the bar is open just be aware the rooms are small
