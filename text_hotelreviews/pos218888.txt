we got a last minute deal so the price was discounted and i would say i was happy to pay that however the price i have seen quoted for the same room at other times seems way over the top it s in a fantastic location if you like shoreditch i used to live there so i know the area well but you don t have to know the area to just walk out the hotel and enjoy it some of the design features were fun maybe a little over the top for my taste at times
