we were going to stay at the hoxton but they have a no cancellation policy and frankly i couldn t afford to lose nearly if our plans changed who can instead we booked into the citizenm on holywell lane and i must say we had a fabulous stay the aesthetic of the hotel is brilliant part boutique hotel part modern art gallery with a very relaxed vibe the staff are friendly and happy to help in any way they can the rooms whilst small had virtually everything we needed for stay free wi fi big tele fridge hairdryer and a king sized bed every room has an ipad which is used to change the mood lighting adjust the temperature open and close the blinds and control the tv there isn t a separate bathroom as such more a shower loo pod in the room sounds odd but it works in a streamlined kind of a way there are even copies of classic penguin books and free movies
