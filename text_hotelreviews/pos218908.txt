superb location in a very trendy area with a wide variation of great restaurants and bars the hotel is very clean and has a great vibe the room is quite small however i loved it it was a perfect cosy size with enough room to move about the bed was massive and extremely comfy the added touch of being able to control everything in the room with an ipad was excellent and meant you never had to leave the bed to change the ac or lights would definitely stay here again
