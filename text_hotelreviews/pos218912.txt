quirky modern boutique hotel in trendy location very comfortable king size bed didnt feel cramped despite the small room area mood lighting in the bathroom was a nice feature cleanliness excellent would definitely recommend this hotel there was a glitch with the it which meant you couldnt watch a film on the tv without any prompting we were given complimentary drinks and breakfast as an apology which was very generous considering i hadnt even complained
