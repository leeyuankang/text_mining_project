the location is excellent and the nearby old street metro station allows you to reach all london s sights also the hotel is close to liverpool street station and it s a great choice if you need to reach one of london s airports this is a very modern hotel with an interesting interior design great facilities and helpful staff the room is quite small but you probably won t be spending much time there anyway you can control everything with an ipad lighting blinds music movies alarm clock etc amazing
