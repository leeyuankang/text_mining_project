love the design of this hotel the room is very modern and design very innovative my room had a big window with a blackout shade that went up and down remotely and the bed was tucked under it liked the bar area and selection of snacks staff was super helpful and friendly seems very youth oriented but i was very comfortable even though i don t fit that age category
