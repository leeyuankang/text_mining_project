the staff was personable and not too over the top with the always on customer service meaning they were all very clearly individuals and they treated me the same there wasn t a customer service script like i hear at other chain hotels and i was able to have quite a few interesting conversations with the staff as a result i also really liked the open work concierge bar area it was a good place to mix with other guests
