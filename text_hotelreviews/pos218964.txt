citizenm in shoreditch is a great place to stay and good value for money the staff were all very friendly the room was clean and modern and had everything that was needed i liked the young and modern atmosphere in the lobby bar lounge areas it s a cool place to have a drink or two and or to plan your next steps in london the world check in as well as check out worked well and was quick it s made more efficient by using screen displays comparable to the airport check in screens whether that s good or bad i leave to one self i would especially mention the good location it s very close to shoreditch high street station and centrally located to explore hip shoreditch s bars restaurants etc i would def go again
