great hotel is fantastic location the rooms are quite small but you probably won t be spending much time there anyway i loved the hi tech nature of the room where you control everything with an ipad they also have a really cool area to hang out downstairs which we would ve liked to enjoy more but there s just so many other other things to do in london
