the bed was amazing it s huge had a big window and tv the staff was really friendly and understandable we had to change rooms the one they gave us was a handicap room and a bit uncomfortable they were so reasonable and understanding the shower and mood lighting is hilarious and amazing it s a great location for going out in shoreditch tons of bars and restaurants around the area and very easy to get to any of the sights
