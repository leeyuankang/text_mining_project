first of all shoreditch is a great area love staying here when i travel second citizenm was a very pleasant surprise the hotel itself is very artsy lots of inspiration for the artistically inclined the bar and lounge on the main level is awesome everyone super friendly and easy place to meet other travelers if you re alone the room itself is small but bed is huge and tv has a lot of channels if you just want to relax in the lobby they even have computers for you to browse the web or print documents out
