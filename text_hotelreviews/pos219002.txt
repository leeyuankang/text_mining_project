the hotel is well communicated by public transport as it is located besides shoreditch train station and within short walking distance minutes max to liverpool street i found the neighbourhood very charming with a hipster vibe and full of trendy small beautiful shops and restos at the high street i had been in another citizen m in london before and did not disappoint me at all on the contrary the comfort and quality standards are very high great bed and shower strong wifi and free a la carte movies menu and the ratio quality price is one of the best in london i have been in stinky b b slightly cheaper staff is super nice and makes your stay very easy and pleasant they are friendly and professional at the same time my friend is italian and she felt like at home as many of them are italians and they included piadina in the buffet i am a happy guest and will keep loyal to citizen m and certainly repeat in this or another one next time i am in london
