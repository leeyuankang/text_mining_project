the lights in our room stopped working and we told staff and went out for the day the lights still did not work when we came back so we called on the phone and natalie was at our room in minutes to trouble shoot on the ipad what controls the lights and everything in the room which is very cool so we got a new room right next door which a quick and convenient fix
