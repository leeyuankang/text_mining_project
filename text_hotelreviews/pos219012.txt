great location rooms are small and podlike but they re well designed so this is fine bar is well stocked and open until a huge bonus in the uk hotel is super hip and i never saw a staff member over feels a little like children of the corn however they re all super happy and friendly so it works maybe the tattooed bar tender needs to read up on what pisco is kind of like tequila is just wrong but this is a small thing great location too super interesting area great t shirt store called we admire a few meters away and a great whisky bar bull in a china shop around the corner
