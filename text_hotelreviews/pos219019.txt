great location in the middle of shoreditch very close to nice restaurants and shops away from mainstream shops but in the middle of a cool area of london the staff was very helpful the drinks at the bar were amazing and the rooms super fancy i would definitely recommend this hotel to any tourist that does not necessarily need to be close to the main tourist attractions
