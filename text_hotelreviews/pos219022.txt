staff was nice the team behind the bar made a nice cappuccinos and were upbeat but not overly friendly or fake the rooms are small but cozy style is great there are lighting presets which sounds weird but is fun reminded me of a yotel for the city as opposed to an airport enjoyed the lobby atmosphere and the proximity to liverpool st station and brick lane is great
