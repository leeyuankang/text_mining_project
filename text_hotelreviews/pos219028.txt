loved it here great location for wandering around shoreditch and all it offers the modern pod like rooms are bigger than we expected and having an ipad to control everything in the room including allowing netflix streaming etc was a real bonus we had great fun with the mood settings in the room it s a sociable hotel with the lounge dining area having loads of quirky space to sit and relax we actually spent more time in the hotel than we expected as we really enjoyed the atmosphere in here the drinks at the bar were reasonably priced too what really makes this a good hotel is the staff we thought with electronic check in etc that there wouldn t be many staff we were wrong they re still there helping you check in advising places to go ringing you a cab etc and they were all happy relaxed fun and helpful just like the vibe of this hotel
