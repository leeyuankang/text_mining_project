the design os amazing stuff really nice had a problem when we checked out even though we ve payed when we checked in the bill on the check out was as if we didnt we told the stuff that we ve already payed and the guy didnt check it and said that we should pay and if the money debits from our credit card we would get a refund luckily we found the invoice and the guy managed to talk to someone who found out that we have already payed this inconvenience left us with a little bit of a bad taste but we really did enjoy the hotel another thing is if you re travelling with suitcases there s not enough space to unpack
