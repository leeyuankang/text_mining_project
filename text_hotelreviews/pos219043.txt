first time staying at a citizenm and absolutely loved it great funky and modern decor really clean and comfortable there was an issue the first night with a loud extractor fan and they moved me into another room with no issues the room itself is the best use of space especially for london and the bed was so huge you can lay diagonally best nights sleep in ages couldn t recommend them enough
