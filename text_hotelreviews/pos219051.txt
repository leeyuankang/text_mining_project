the extra large bed was awesome upon checking in the hotel felt a little too automated and trendy for its own good but i really liked all the extra touches like the personalized welcome on the tv and the ipad that controlled everything in the room from the curtains to the hue lights i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will return great value for the trendiness good alternative to ace hotel
