i had several other hotels booked for that night but i am so glad i chose the citizenm in the end everything about the room and the hotel itself was beautiful the d cor is amazing everyone was so friendly and the vibe of the hotel itself was such a relaxed and chilled atmosphere the bed was the best bed i have ever slept in and the free movies was the cherry on top of a wonderfully iced cake both myself and my partner will be looking out for citizenms wherever we go now as it s definitely our preferred hotel
