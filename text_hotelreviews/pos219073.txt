brilliant location really in the centre of where you want to be in shoreditch the check in process was good and the bed was soo comfy and the room had a great view over east london compact but very cool room loved the mood lighting and free films little tip we signed up on line as members and both got free drinks at the bar anything you wanted from the menu
