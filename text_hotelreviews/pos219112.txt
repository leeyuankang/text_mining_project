small but very stylish rooms with a great view of london and a massive king size bed if possible choose for a room on one of the upper floors for a better view each room comes with a tablet to control the lighting and tv which is pretty cool location is excellent in the middle of shoreditch so lots of hip bars and restaurants within walking distance
