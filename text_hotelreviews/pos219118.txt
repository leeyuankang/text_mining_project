huge bed with a panoramic view of the sky line a quick bolt hole before and after a late gig in dalston clean quiet and spacious and so light and an ironing room at the end of the corridor excellent for people like me who can t pack without creasing clothes hopelessly i go to gigs where i can t get back home in time for any sort of public transport to be running i m more than happy to stay in citizen m instead of racing against time to get the last train home
