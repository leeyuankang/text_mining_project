really friendly staff who made you feel at home nice chilled out vibe at the social area could have sat at the bar all night bright modern room with plenty of storage despite being fairly small room fully controlled by an ipad which is a nice fun touch excellent choice of entertainments in the room good location near transport and restaurants perfect for a young couple
