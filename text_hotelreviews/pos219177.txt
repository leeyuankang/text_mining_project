a great hotel great location you can tell it s designed by people who stay in hotels as there really is everything you d ever need and none of the annoying nonsense that you don t need process was super slick and staff were so helpful breakfast was delicious and had so many veggie options i d have rated but there was a bit of confusion around whether breakfast was included for my party of us had it and of us didn t for some reason i got different advice from different staff members which was a little frustrating when i was in a rush however everyone was really friendly
