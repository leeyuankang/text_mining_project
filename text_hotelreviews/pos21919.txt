the hotel is fantastic in design i love the curtains the wall and every other decorations they are all exquisite and exotic for me also the hotel is near to the eurostar station mins car so it is convenient to move luggages there are lots of nice restaurants near the hotel with a wide range of food types to choose from most importantly the hotel staff cleans the room frequently so i give a definite five star for the cleaness of the room
