attention to detail made all the difference the room was small but perfectly appointed very comfortable and quiet the staff were amazing spoke excellent english and were charming the breakfast was simple but delicious croissants scrambled eggs fruit salad orange juice and the best tea outside of sri lanka i have had the location is ideal minutes from the metro near all sorts of eating places quiet but central there is a rather seedy area round the corner but being so near to the moulin rouge its what you would expect
