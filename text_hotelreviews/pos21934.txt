the hotel is beautiful it oozes character it has a strong theme it s quiet the service is friendly disarming and discreet the cocktail bar is beautiful and the cocktails are absolutely excellent the spa which you hire solely for your own use rather than sharing with other guests is incredibly peaceful and private nice location too a great hotel
