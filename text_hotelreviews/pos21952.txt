we have travelled quite a lot through europe asia and america coming from australia and the service and experience here at maison souquet was at a very high standard we enjoyed the banter with alex our butler and alexandre the concierge very knowledgeable and friendly team and great location with easy access to subway station blanche to get around paris highly recommend you stay here
