we stayed here for our honeymoon in a wonderful junior suite and were greeted by rose petals over the bedding and a bottle of champagne we stayed for nights and as a thank you from the owners for a long stay they offered us another bottle of champagne towards the end of our stay beautifully decorated warm and welcoming staff rooms attended to twice daily so always super clean and tidy hermes bath products were a welcome addition and the overall scent in the hotel was incredible location excellent just opposite the moulin rouge and blanche metro station for access to the rest of paris loved the hotel and would definitely come back here again
