the location was excellent it was off the champs elysees and a minute walk from the arc de triomphe the staff at the reception was extremely friendly and helpful i was travelling with my pregnant wife and the reception staff did their best to ensure that she got the biggest room possible so that she would not feel claustrophobic and had space to walk around the room had beautiful french furniture and the bathroom was great
