the staff is incredible and the location is everything you re steps away from the literal heart of paris the area is very safe during the night as well i had no issue walking from the tower to the hotel after midnight ordered room service twice food was excellent and portions were very large my room had a nice view of the streets below and even though it wasn t a walk out balcony you could still sit on it a bit the only issue i had were in some minor details i had some issues with the room phone one of my lights didn t work and the tub wouldn t fill however i was out a majority of the day so i didn t really care the other issue i had was room services letting a door slam repeatedly while cleaning the room next to mine at i actually had to get out of bed to tell them to stop so i could sleep it promptly subsided taxi service is quick and easy and bike rentals are legit right outside of the hotel doors tons of restaurants near by the bed will suck you in tons of fluffy pillows and soft bedding
