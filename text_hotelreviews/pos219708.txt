booked this hotel for a romantic getaway and was pleasantly surprised in a few areas firstly the location is outstanding genuinely only a few moments away from the arc de triomphe end of the champs elysee makes sightseeing and coordinating extremely easy our room had a view of the eiffel tower which was a wonderful addition to wake up to the room decor is classy and comfortable staff generally pleasant and helpful breakfast was usual european affair good selection but for a residence i d recommend a wider variety or a daily special to add a bit of glamour and excitement otherwise a really lovely stay and would thoroughly recommend for a quick romantic getaway due to the luxury ease and proximity to the sights
