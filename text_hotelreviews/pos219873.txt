the rooms are very unusual and the hotel is in a great location closest metro is le peletier about mins away it is in a typical parisian street so lovely views out of the front rooms onto other side of terrace with beautiful ironwork railings bed very comfy rooms were cleaned each day to a good standard day staff were friendly and gave us a map of the area and offered to research musical shows for us as we were unsure which to see
