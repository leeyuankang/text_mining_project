the hotel is ideally situated le peltier and grand boulevard stations are very close and have great links all around paris we had a superior room and by parisian standards it was a decent size the bed was huge albeit a little too firm for me we loved the boutique feel about the hotel and the staff were so helpful i d like to thank victoria in particular she was always happy to help and always so patient in finding the best metro routes to the destinations i required there are countless bistro s bars and cafe s within walking distance if you are looking to shop there is the galerries lafayette which has every high end brand you can imagine as well as shops like topshop etc there are also supermarkets and lots of local bakeries to pick up some breakfast from if you are looking for a non parisian lunch check out fonzarelli pizza it is outstanding bar m has fantastic tapas with a great local vibe at all times of the day sitting in their covered outside area watching paris pass you by if we were to return to paris we would defintely look to stay in the opera district again and would recommend eugene to any couple looking for a quaint boutique hotel
