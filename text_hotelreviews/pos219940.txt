we checked in with no problems and were shown to our room we booked the superior double room via booking com once in our room we received a phone call from reception to say there had been a mix up and we d been given the wrong room we were then shown to our new room which was even better i wouldn t have known the first room was not the room that we booked the rooms are of good size and nicely decorated the bed and the pillows were very comfortable and there were full black out curtains which created a great nights sleep after long days of sight seeing the bathroom was big enough with a huge shower head there was also a proper hairdryer provided so no need to bring your own not like other hair dryers provided in a hotel a selection of shower gels soaps and shampoos were also available as well as lovely white bath towels all staff were very friendly and did a lot to answer questions and help they even arranged a shuttle bus for our return trip to the airport which would cost only a few euros more than getting the rer train from cdg airport we had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back to this hotel for a return visit it s in a convenient location and metro stops are near by for getting around with a lot of sights within walking distance as well
