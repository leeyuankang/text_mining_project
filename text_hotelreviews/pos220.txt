i loved the hotel design and decoration staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling that is something you really appreciate when you are on a hour business trip breakfast was way better than i expected although coffee was quite bad that is something most hotels fail to nail and i think most guests find it important rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable
