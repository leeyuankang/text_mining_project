you would have to try very hard to find a hotel as nice as this in central paris not exactly cheap but few stars are in large cities our room was in the back so nice and quiet but quite big well appointed and tastefully decorated the bed was comfy and the air conditioning was fairly quiet we were in paris for the tennis and this hotel was near madeleine an easy one interchange ride on the metro
