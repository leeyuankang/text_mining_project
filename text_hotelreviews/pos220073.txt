a small hotel but excellently refurbished we were upgraded which was nice the restaurant served good french food but unfortunately the bottle of wine was pretty poor breakfast was adequate with some cooked food but bread croisons weren t great staff were very helpful and spoke basic english and helped with my french the location was relatively close to all major tourist attractions within a good walk anyway we would definitely stay there again if coming back to the area
