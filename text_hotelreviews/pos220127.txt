the location couldn t have been better for seeing the key sites in paris the staff were absolutely lovely they even complimented my husband and me on our french even though it wasn t nearly as good as when we lived there and the rooms were well appointed very clean and extremely comfortable a perfect stay to finish off a wonderful vacation in france
