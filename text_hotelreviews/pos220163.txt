the hotel is awesome it is strategically located on the small nice street right at the corner of madleine square so that you could easily walk either to champs lys es or to grand boulevards opera area there is an underground parking on the same street very convenient for anyone arriving by car normally you do not need car in paris it is much nicer to walk here so it is worth to park the car during your stay hotel provide discount for the parking you have to bring and stamp your parking ticket at the reception to validate the discount parking price is euro night the room is really big especially according to paris standards it is a little bit too dark and too grey at my taste but at the same time i must admire that it is really stylish the lobby is perfectly furnished and decorated so you could spend some minutes just sitting and relaxing there to feel the atmosphere staff is enough friendly and trained wi fi connection is stable enough bathroom needs some things to be fixed and i would add that comfort and convenience were sacrificed here in from of designers ideas anyway it is just my small remark and i would not say it is a kind of minor point spoil yourself with hermes shower gel and shampoo i would expect better housekeeping here cleaning was not enough i can surely recommend this hotel for everyone visiting paris and i would say that it is worth to pay the room price even if i consider the value as a little bit too high
