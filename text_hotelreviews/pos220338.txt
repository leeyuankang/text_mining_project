the bed was comfortable and the room bathroom very clean staff made you feel welcome location in montmartre is excellent we liked montmartre so much during our three night stay we only went into paris once lots of bars and bistros around easy to get to from gard du nord by metro from blanche metro the hotel is less than five minute walk off rue lepic
