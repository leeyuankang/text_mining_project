this is a boutique hotel with comfortable bed beautifully decorated and extremely helpful staff we had a classic room which was too small with luggage rather book a comfort room which costs a little more but is bigger we did not eat breakfast so cannot comment there are excellent restaurants nearby i recommend le petit parisien and le restaurant hotel will give you directions
