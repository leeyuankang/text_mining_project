loved this hotel for a number of reasons firstly the warm and friendly welcome from mauricio at reception throughout our stay secondly location location location as you are beside plenty of restaurants and bars thirdly beds the most comfortable i have ever stayed in any hotel and the place is spotless the rooms were fantastic with a minibar available with plenty of varied choice also the room comes with wifi speaker system which was great especially when we were getting ready to go to a concert and could listen to our tunes in prep i ve stayed in other hotels in this location but this was by far the best for both service and comfort hence i will stay again thanks to mauricio and the other staff for making our stay an enjoyable one
