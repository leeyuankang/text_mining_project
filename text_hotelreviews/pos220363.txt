the decor of our room was pinks and lime greens i do not know whether the other rooms are as cheerfully decorated but i enjoyed our room the staff was very helpful and willingly answered all our questions about the hotel and the area the hotel itself was not in the middle of the very touristy area so was quiet and relaxing but not far from the restaurants and attractions
