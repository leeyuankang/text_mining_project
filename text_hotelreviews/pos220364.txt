perfect location down a quiet side street close to restaurants and bars excellent base for visiting all the major attractions in paris being easy walking distance from metro stations hotel room was a good size with a comfortable bed twin beds pushed together but absolutely fine and lovely decor good size bathroom with excellent shower over the bath clean and quiet the staff were very friendly and helpful we would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we were visiting paris in the future
