the relais montmartre is in a great location the staff all so helpful pleasant from housekeeping to front desk breakfast was great in bed so filling great restaurants in area for lunch on corner le relais gascon has great price fixes lunch and there is a brilliant shoe repairer directly opposite to deal with any emergencies it s worth the extra to soak in a bath after a long day or an early flight we paid for early arrival the street is so quiet at night and not many hotels have tea and coffee facilities in room
