staff extremely helpful and friendly location great just a few minutes walk to sacr c ur and some lovely restaurants in the area the hotel is on a side road so although close to the bustle it s nice and quite at night i think the hotel has recently undergone a face lift our room was extremely comfortable and clean this was our second visit we will return again
