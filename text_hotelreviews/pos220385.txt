my sister and i were booked in however there was a problem with one of the rooms so they organised for me to stay at another hotel not far away my sister became ill on the morning we were meant to leave i was able to leave as she was not sick enough for a doctor but she could not travel for days the hotel was extremely helpful and very caring about the situation i would recommend this hotel to anyone
