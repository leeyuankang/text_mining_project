the location of this hotel is wonderful right by the jardin de luxumbourg our rooms were right at the top on the sixth floor which meant magical views over the rooftops of paris like being in the aristocats said our daughter we loved the rooms especially as we had a suite for my three teenage children my son had a sofa bed in a room with folded doors so not at all cramped and he could shut out his sisters we loved it and one of the loveliest hotels i have stayed in the coffees in the rooms were delicious
