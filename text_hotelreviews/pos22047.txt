the room was minute and the only way to switch off the light in the bathroom was to take out the central switch card this meant that during the night i almost fell twice and hurt myself although i asked for a hot cup of water in room service i was told i need to take it up from a kettle available to guests i have some dry cleaning the night i arrived for next day afternoon delivery and i had to keep checking until at least the night reception person at arrival was not very friendly and quite rude
