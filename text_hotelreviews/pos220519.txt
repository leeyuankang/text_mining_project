the rooms i booked were not twin separate beds as i requested i had my teenage children with me who wanted there own bed this was fixed the following day but stressful when we arrived i also requested no ground floor room as they are dark and noisy from previous experiance again we were allocated a ground floor room but we we were moved to an alternative better grade room at the same price i have stayed many times at this hotel on business trips its location is the no factor
