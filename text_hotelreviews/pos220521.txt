after seeing some negative reviews on tripadvisor we were skeptical but the price through booking com was unbeatable so we gave it a try it was perfect we had three adults for nights hard to accommodate in paris but they upgraded us to their largest suite and provided extra padding for the pull out bed and everything was very comfortable and clean the staff was extraordinarily friendly and housekeeping was attentive the wifi worked except for a couple of hours one night the ac was perfectly adequate though the weather was not particularly hot when we were there the minibar was stocked and we enjoyed the little wine bar in the lobby sitting area which is beautifully appointed with historic touches and is very lovely and pleasant the hotel could not be better located staying near the place de madeleine is a perfect choice for ease of sightseeing museums shopping dining gourmet foods and transport the metro is nearby and a taxi stand is just steps away from the hotel the taxis in paris by the way are terrific and very affordable many great sights including the madeleine church opera place de concord tuileries and louvre are also very walkable from this location we did not sign up for the breakfast preferring to venture out to the numerous nearby cafes but we did wind up spending about the same amount as we would have if we had ordered from the hotel i would highly recommend this lovely little hotel and would definitely stay there again
