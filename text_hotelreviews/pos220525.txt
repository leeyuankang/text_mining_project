we arrived after a flight to brussels then a train to paris and finally a taxi to the hotel they were able to store our bags while we walked around paris the staff was most friendly and ready with a recommendation for dinner at a nearby delicious restaurant the room had a great set up for a family as their was a low partition between the beds we could see our daughter but she wasn t directly next to us the beds were comfortable and the room was clean i wish we were able to stay longer than one night
