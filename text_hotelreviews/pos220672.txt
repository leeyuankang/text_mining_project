we had to book this at literally the last minute after we arrived in paris and found our rented apartment had been double booked the staff was very cosmopolitan and extremely friendly and helpful the free local smartphone they provide with every room was incredibly useful and an unexpected perk it saved us from needing to spend for an international data plan which are always ridiculously expensive
