the maison fl is a wonderful boutique hotel that ticks every box the rooms are superb the ambience is calm the restaurant serves excellent food this hotel is truly a home away from home the staff are genuinely friendly they even gave me a local phone to use which came in extremely handy i was able to take a lovely walk and navigate with google maps on the hotel phone with this i went all the way to the trocadero and on to the champs elys es i absolutely love this hotel i will certainly be back thanks
