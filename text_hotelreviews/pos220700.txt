the staff were exceptional very friendly especially the guy on the night desk who doubled up as the barman he was very happy chatty was a wanted bad influence by talking us into getting a bottle of champagne that he then put in an ice bucket with a tray so we could take upstairs even offering to add an extra hour after check out in case we had a hangover the room though small is very comfortable clean it s a shame that the weather was too cold to make use of the balcony also great location easy walk to the eiffel tower
