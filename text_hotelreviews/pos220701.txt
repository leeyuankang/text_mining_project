the staff were so nice they couldn t do enough for us we were only in paris for days and they helped us make the most of it by making reservations for shows providing us with tickets etc and arranging transport for us too really nice staff and the hotel was really clean too not to mention the hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing we would definitely book again
