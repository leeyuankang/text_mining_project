very clean hotel tastefully decorated excellent location min walk from a major metro stop min walk to the base of the arc de triomphe and a min walk to the champs lys es lots of places to eat around the hotel extremely courteous and helpful staff who solved every problem and issue for us if there were any rooms are big by paris and european standards absolutely no complaints and would repeat our stay here whenever we are in paris breakfast is good but could have been better but maybe since all other aspects of the hotel set such high standards we are being a bit harsh lovely property and amazing hospitality from the staff
