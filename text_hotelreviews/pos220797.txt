this hotel was nice very clean close proximity to the arc de triumphe and room was nicely decorated however we visited on our honeymoon which we advised the hotel of before arrival and this was never even acknowledged i wasn t expecting freebies but a congratulations on arrival would have been nice not a big issue but it did deflate our initial excitement at arriving in beautiful paris hotel is quiet so this is a good base if you plan on being out all day and want a nice hotel to come back to in the evenings to sleep all in all we did enjoy our stay but would perhaps avoid for a special occasion
