my girlfriend and i stayed at this hotel between decmber on check in the front desk staff were very helpful they spoke english and assisted us with our luggage the room was small typical for paris but very clean and practical the front desk staff printed off our tour vouchers for us and gave us some advice on nice places to eat around the local area the location of this hotel is perfect round the corner from the world famous champs elysee but yet still very quiet and peaceful there is a metro station about from the hotel entrance and a newsagents type shop away breakfast was good but i did expect a little more choice of hot food my girlfriend and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be returning
