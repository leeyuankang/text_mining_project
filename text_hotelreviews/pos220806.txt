its not my first time here staying in this hotel is the true paris experience the quite neighborhood even though the crowded champs lys es is a few steps away the parisien style the comfort its very worm feels home lovely staff very clean and simple and being rated as stars is an advantage making it a luxury place without arrogance its far from the noise and in the middle of the crowd i usually take the superior room of m square which offers an elegant and spacious bathroom which is quite important for us as young couple the charles de gaulle etoile metro station is just down stairs giving you an access to all paris the facilities in the room are so generous i strongly recommend this hotel specially for couples and of course it will be my choice each time visiting my beautiful paris
