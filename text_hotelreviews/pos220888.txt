very comfortable bed excellent shower heated towel rack sound proof double glazed windows on lower floor rooms quiet nicely decorated reception lounge and breakfast room security is good the staff is extremely helpful and patient with many questions coming at them my only complaint is the elevator which is completely inadequate for a hotel with that many bedrooms typical of many parisian hotels
