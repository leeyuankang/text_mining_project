i just have to commend emanuelle and isabelle they went above and betond to assist me and my son we were delayed by train from lyxembourg which would have prevented us from picking up our paris pass documents even though short staffed they went to the facility that distributes these passes and pick them up for us so we would be able to enjoy paris and not waste our investment i run customer experience for my company alriaource and i can honestly say that these two employees are two of the best service individuals o have ever encountered i would hire them in a heartbeat it is my hope that they are aptly rewarded and recognized for providing exemplary service thank you regards jennifer
