i liked everything was in there to start with receptionist named madisson i m not good with names and her colleague a girl they two were very friendly helpful and all smiles biggest bonus of our stay was the guy in the bar also catering mgr many thanks to him and respect to house keeping staff of the floor the hotel is surrounded by many cafes and restaurants barbershop cleaning services pharmacy and other clothing and gift shops across the street there are maillout shopping mall mega one metro station rental cars bars and prestigious restaurants everything you need is just steps away metro station takes wherever you want to be so you don t need a car in case you prefer rides uber drivers are driving around all the time hotel itself was up to the great expectations and the high review score
