hotel looks lovely with very attentive and friendly staff room wasn t the biggest but facilities and comfort made up for it bed was ever so comfortable and the bathroom was lovely choice on tv was limited but we weren t in enough to worry location was brilliant for the metro with some lovely walkable restaurants and bars as well as visits to moulin rouge and monmartre we had breakfast one morning and it was great overall we ll definitely be using again if ever in the area highly recommended
