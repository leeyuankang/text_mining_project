we were there for our honeymoon and they upgraded our room free of charge the staff were really helpful and great with suggestions for restaurants sights entertainment etc they were also helpful in arranging a bottle of champagne in our room as a surprise for my wife even though we were later than they expected they changed ice every mins to keep chilled
