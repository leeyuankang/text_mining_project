this hotel is in a great location in montmartre the hotel is very cosy we stayed in a bed room and though small was perfect the staff were very helpful and we used them to arrange a dinner in the area as well as a river cruise the breakfast was simple but exactly what we needed the garden would be lovely but the weather was about degrees to cool
