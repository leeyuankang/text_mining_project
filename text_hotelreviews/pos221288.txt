this was a great stay for us and our year old the rooms were spacious and clean the staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was good and the garden behind the property was a very nice place to relax and play with our child it s about minutes walking distance from the arc de triomphe which marks one end of champs elysees with all its shopping and dining options the hotel is also close to the metro though we were unable to utilize it as none of the metro entrances have disabled elevator access a bit shameful for paris so taking our stroller in wasn t an option
