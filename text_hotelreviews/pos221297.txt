the service was very good the front desk staff are ever so helpful and the staff manning the breakfast are very pleasant a special thanks to filip i also loved the room it was spacious really appreciated the fact that they provided complimentary soft drinks in the minibar everyday the garden was lovely and the location of the hotel is fantastic it is walkable from two metro stations the palais de congress and some nice restaurants too there is also a good bakery across the street as well as a supermarket the best part is that the hotel is located behind the main street which means that it is quiet what else can one ask for
