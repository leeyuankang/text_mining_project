we booked a mercure on purpose as we had been travelling for days and knew that there was a good chance of a decent bed we were right never slept in one that big before must have been wide the area is also great good cafes bakers and restaurants esp les trois garcons by the way also mins walk from the eifel tower and the metro is very close can t fault the place underground private parking was also a serious factor in choosing this hotel
