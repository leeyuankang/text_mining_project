stayed here for nights with my husband and teenage boys we absolutely loved le placide and it s very personalized service friendly and helpful staff who made sure they were able to help in whatever way they can i left my shopping bag in a cafe with an old scarf which i loved and i asked if they could call the cafe and just tell them to hold it for me and i would pass for it the next day to my delight one of the staff went to the store personally and i had my stuff in the hotel after i came back from a day of sightseeing i really appreciated the gesture we also left a few items behind after we checked out and they kept them for us until we could go back from provence to pick them up beds are definitely comfortable and bathrooms were clean room size was just right even for my boys who shared a room location is amazing and near bon march and many cafes and places to shop but the real gem of this hotel are the people managing it would definitely stay in le placide and recommend it to friends
