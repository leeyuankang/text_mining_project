the bed was super comfortable as were the pillows bathroom was like none other very spacious and had a spa feeling the staff made my experience well worth it they were very professional and helpful i commend them my outstanding experience started from i entered the hotel very beautiful and inviting to when i checked out minutes walk to china town the tram stop is right in front of the hotel on the main road while the underground station that appears to be new is a minute walk from linate airport i boarded the bus right outside the airport to the last stop duomo the duomo is uniquely beautiful from the duomo take tram or verify direction from hotel and arrive at the hotel in less than minutes this might not be the best route but it was an easy route that required just one ticket costing the hotel does provide pick up from hotel for or breakfast was good but not outstanding as is what i was expecting for the restaurant attached to the hotel is a must the food was good the owner very polite and since we sat at the kitchen bar and could see as they prepare every dish the cooks were pleasant and articulate in their detail to preparing each dish restaurant has a live dj too totally enjoyed my stay
