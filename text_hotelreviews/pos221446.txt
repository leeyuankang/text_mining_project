the beds were very comfortable because the hotel is new the bedding and rooms are very stylish and comfortable the rooms also had pretty decent sound proofing that kept the street and hallway noise out heavy curtains let you sleep in if you wanted as they kept the light from outside out they had breakfast on premises as well as restaurants if you didn t feel like venturing out
