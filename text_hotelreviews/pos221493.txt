great location to many points of interest in london staff was very helpful and attended to our needs very well the head concierge mr joe rodriguez was asked by one in our group if he could id the location of a picture of his father during time a large hotel was in the background but nothing more was known well he and a college found the hotel and it s location was not london as was thought but instead in brighton he quoted the name of the hotel and i fired up google earth on the cell phone and i couldn t believe it it was the hotel in the background of the picture taken in i was very impressed over and above the call of duty
