our holiday wasn t the greatest for us as my wife hurt herself badly and ended up the last couple of days between resting and attending the hospital i cannot praise your staff enough especially marie and oliver i asked but didn t really expect our time for vacating our room to be extended as our flight wasn t until late in the evening she done this twice for us and said if we needed longer or anything just to ask please make a point of letting your top management know this
