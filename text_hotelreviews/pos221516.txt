this is a wonderful oasis in a quiet place at the bottom of regent street just moments from piccadilly circus trafalgar square national gallery and theatres which could easily be missed most places you want to go are within minutes walk warm welcome from very friendly staff beautifully appointed hotel we were in a superior queen room which was very good bed was very comfortable air conditioning good and windows opened allowing fresh air we liked the bar downstairs where we got an excellent post theatre supper we ran out of time to use the decent sized gym which had a good range of equipment
