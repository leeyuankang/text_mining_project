the staff must first be commended they were very welcoming and nothing was to difficult try the bar the drink selection and service is excellent and the guys can sure make a cocktail nice thing about the rooms they had everything that you would need and in all my travels probably the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on definitely will be back
