we had a delightful stay at the sofitel we tried a couple hotels in the uk and the sofitel was definitely the best all the staff from the reception to the room service were always ready to help with a big smile the concierge was always available to give suggestions directions and tickets we checked in at a m and our rooms were ready for us they made sure that we had very close rooms since we were a big family we thank them alot and we gave them a perfect even though they actually deserve more than that
