the staff were all very curteous without exception check in was swift and my luggage delivered very quickly the room only lacked one thing a mirror over the dressing table to dry your hair with the hair dryer you had to use a long mirror in the wall too far away just a minor detail overall a good experience as a woman travelling alone i did not feel awkward or vulnerable there were no middle eastern men hanging around the lobby area always a relief and all too familiar in park lane hotels i would stay again
