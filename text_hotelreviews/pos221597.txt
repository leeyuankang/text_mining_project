besides being a gorgeous building in a great location the staff of this hotel were absolutely superior in every way i started getting emails the minute we made our reservation and before we left home we had restaurant reservations and lots of information for our stay from arrival to departure everyone was so helpful cheerful and accommodating we had a problem watching movies on demand and they offered us another room goodies left for us every night the location was stellar two blocks in either direction and your were in a main area piccadilly circus trafalgar square the mall theater district shopping we were in the center of it all the restaurant was excellent and room service was very fast we cannot say enough good things about this hotel we loved it and will stay there again for sure and try other sofitel hotels in other countries
