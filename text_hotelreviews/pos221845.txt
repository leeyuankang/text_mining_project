clean comfortable excellent location for kensington and albert hall the room was very good in all aspects but the staff are the crowning glory everyone spoke to us at all times and the reception door staff are first class probably one of the nicest hotel experiences we had in a long time particular mention to ricardo a very pleasant and professional receptionist
