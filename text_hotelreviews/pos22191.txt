if using the metro it s great if you are walking be good with directions street names weren t obviously visible the staff that checked us in were incredible checking in was a tad slow but we were told it s because they extended bookings for people from london who didn t feel safe returning to their country because of the london bridge attack i like that the hotel was so accommodating for them it shows they had a heart breakfast was a nice selection
