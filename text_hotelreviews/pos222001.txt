we have stayed at this hotel several times and the fact that we keep going back there shows that we find the hotel generally very good we will be booking there for our next visit also the rooms are very comfortable the staff excellent and we find the location to be very handy for what we want to do with bus and tube options for getting into central london just a short walk away there are numerous restaurants bars and shops should you not want to move far
