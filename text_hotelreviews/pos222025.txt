i loved the free cookie as you walked through the door and the staff were really helpful in helping me to park my car in the cheapest place possible the hotel was in an ideal location in that it was only a walk from angel tube station the room was lovely and cosy and when me and my girlfriend got back from our first day out even though i hadn t left the towels on the floor to be cleaned they still gave us fresh towels and gave the room a general tidy
