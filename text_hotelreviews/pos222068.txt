the hotel was not too far from the tube station it s great that you can leave your bags at the hotel before check in after check out we wish we had taken advantage of this instead we had to walk around london for a day with our suitcase we thought we d be able to leave it at kings cross we had a lovely meal in the restaurant very good food
