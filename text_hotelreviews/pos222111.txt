ricardo originally from portugal was the concierge who greeted us and helped us throughout the stay he made the experience so much better and welcomed he gave us recommendations on places to eat and visit and told us about how london compares to other cities every night we d get back to the hotel looking to see if ricardo was working the important aspect of it is that we d have honest two way communication it felt as if i was catching up with an old friend who wanted me to have the best experience while in london
