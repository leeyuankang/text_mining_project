we d been traveling around uk staying mostly in apartments and b b but in our last days we decided to stay in this hotel to rest and it was an excellent idea the staff is really really good very professional and polite and allow us to get a late check out we love islington angel location but but we know what we re looking for this is not the perfect location if this is your first time in london and want to be around main city attractions
