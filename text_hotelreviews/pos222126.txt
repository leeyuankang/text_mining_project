great location and facilities the hotel is around the corner from the angel tube station and there is a bus stop out side so getting around is so easy the room was really nice and clean free wifi and access to the fitness suite we had access to the executive lounge where drinks where available all day we had the option to have breakfast in there too would recommend this and would go again
