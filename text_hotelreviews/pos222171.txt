we stayed in a queen room which was very spacious for the two of us the bed was comfy and our bathroom was clean and tidy when we arrived it was nice to have the option of a bath or a shower hanging and ironing space in the room which made it convenient as we didn t have to iron everything before we set off the aesthetic of the hotel was beautiful and all the staff were pleasant
