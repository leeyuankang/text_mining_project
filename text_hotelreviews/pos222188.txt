the standard is more that of an inn than a dt by hilton there was an extremely long walk to the rooms through various corridors and no offer to help with luggage i had big bags arriving from a long haul international flight half of the toiletries were missing in the bathroom the duvet was very thin there was not extra blanket provided and i felt cold in the middle of the night although it was april london was experiencing winter temperatures i was extremely unimpressed with the payment procedure i was asked to both pay on check in and then again when checking out leaving it unclear if payment had been taken once or twice the offer to contact them again in case of double charging is not my idea of customer service procedures should be clear
