breakfast very good everything you could hope for and more overall a very smooth and comfortable stay very near to bus and tube stations difficult to understand the room rates which seems to change from day to day on booking com but ended up with a satisfactory cost for a good hotel in a good area with very good breakfast included there was no hard sell either so i didn t pressured to take extra services but they were available if you wanted them there were lots of notices saying to let them know if anything wasn t right with a promise they would put it right which was re assuring though i had no cause to complain at any time
