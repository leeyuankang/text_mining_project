we both found the staff very friendly helpful and welcoming on arrival the bed was really comfortable and the room was quiet and away from any traffic noise the late breakfast was a bonus too so we didn t have to get up too early the location was ideal for us and close enough to life but far enough away to be fairly quiet would highly recommend it
