whilst the room was very spacious and comfortable the bathroom although very clean was tiny especially as it was supposedly a superior twin room the breakfast was great with a lovely choice of juices and food the amenities were very good we stayed here to go to a concert at the royal albert hall and it was just a few minutes walk
