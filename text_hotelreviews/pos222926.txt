the croissants were poor as was the general breakfast experience but the hotel was ok in general i only say ok i wouldn t specifically book there again as there are other hotels in london where i have had a better overall experience it is mainly down to the staff again they were ok but for that type of hotel i would expect better i expect ok at a travelodge or a premier inn
