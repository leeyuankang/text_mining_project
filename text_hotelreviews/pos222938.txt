from the moment we arrived we knew we were going to have a fantastic weekend we arrived early to check in and our room wasn t ready but we were assured that it would be worth the wait as we had been given a complimentary upgrade later in the evening there was an issue with our room and so without question we were moved again to an even better room which was absolutely fantastic the staff couldn t have been any more helpful throughout our stay restaurant recommendations were great delicious breakfasts at the hotel we couldn t have wished for a better hotel stay location is fantastic for the museums the hop on hop off bus stops just outside and gloucester road tube station a minute walk away
