the room was spacious comfortable clean quiet the continental breakfast had a nice variety of foods and they catered for specific dietary requests the staff were friendly helpful no request seemed too much lovely bar to have a relaxing drink in hotel in the perfect location for museums royal albert hall and the area has a village kind of feel lots of eateries nearby to choose from tube station minute walk and bus stop right outside hotel will definitely be staying again
