welcoming helpful staff on reception when we had a problem with our air conditioning they tried their best to help and as they could not change our room or get anyone to have a look that night gave us a complimentary full english breakfast we also had an unexpected upgrade to an executive suite which was lovely and made our weekend the breakfast was delicious
