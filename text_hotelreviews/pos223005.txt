the room was massive everything in good condition and seemed quite new the bed was very comfortable we got a great discounted rate and were a little worried when we heard we had a lower ground floor room normally this means you get given a tiny and dark room in the basement ours was large and quite bright i would definitely recommend it fantastic location min walk to the museums and imperial college right next to gloucester road tube station to go a bit further also many restaurants and supermarkets next door
