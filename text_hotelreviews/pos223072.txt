the location of the hotel right on the piccadilly line and close to the gloucester road station could not be better the hotel is cosy and has its own pub and restaurant gloucester rod has a good variety of pubs restaurants and cafes and is lively but not noisy we would choose this hotel again and we highly recommend it
