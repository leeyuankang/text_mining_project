i stayed here with my other half for one night in december i put down a special request on my booking as we were celebrating our one year anniversary we arrived slightly early at the hotel at but check in was unfortunately the room wasn t ready yet but they held our bags for us and we went out as planned and checked in a bit later on once we arrived in our room later on it was beautifully decorated with swan towel s on the bed with real roses all round the bed little things like this go a very long way so thank you very much
