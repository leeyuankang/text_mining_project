great neighbourhood i did not know so glad to discover it esp rue des martyrs which has many lovely shops bakeries eateries and grocers and seemed quite family friendly there are three metro lines nearby one gets quickly to any part of the city and the gare du nord is a min walk away the hotel is super well equipped the wifi works very well and there is a nice honesty tea coffee bar and everything seems to be thought through for the enjoyment of guests air conditioning very good not loud at all and you can control it in the room
