the staff is super nice they ask you about your day if you are enjoying and give you tips about the city it was also a surprise for me but they provide almost everything you might need for free need shaving cream they give you a razor kit with razor blade need a bath robe you got it even in the last day when we went to get our bags in the end of the day they offered us a coffee or a drink from the bar if we wanted the room has a nice size and even with the bags you don t feel like you can t walk around the bathroom has an hairdryer and it s a nice one so you don t need to take one also they give you slippers the room has nice windows that block the sound from the street so unless you have someone yelling down there you won t be bothered by the passing cars also we didn t had any problems with neighbor s noise the room is cleaned everyday and they do a nice job at it the breakfast seems to be just a few things when you first look at the room in the morning but then you notice that you can find a nice variety of cheeses and croissants and yogurts etc all neatly tucked away in cupboards and baskets that make you feel quite at home the location for us was great you have a metro station literally away on foot if you take the metro there you can be in the louve in like minutes and in the eiffel tower in half an hour paris is a really big city so we felt very happy with the location after going to almost everything that is to see
