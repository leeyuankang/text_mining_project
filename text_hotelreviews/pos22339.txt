very nice staff perfect location love the bathroom and shower experience the bed was very comfortable and the food is amazing i changed from another hotel into this one because they seriously wanted me to hand out my keys in a tiny garage in paris without giving me any security for my car the parking is more expensive at this hotel but worth it as you have a safe public peking garage nearby and nobody wants you to hand over your keys which is almost crazy in paris if you aren t in a star hotel
