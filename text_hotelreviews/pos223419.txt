easy to get about with holborn underground so close i loved the ambience both of the public areas and the rooms i ve rarely had a room so well geared up for getting work done with a decent level of light a good range of power sockets a work area that actually lets you spread out and a comfortable work chair the wifi was fast and reliable and all the other room amenities just worked as you would want them to the staff were super friendly too
