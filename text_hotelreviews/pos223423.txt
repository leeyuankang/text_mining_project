we chose this hotel for its closeness to covent garden where we had planned to attend a concert the position is perfect just few minutes by foot from holborn underground station and a few more to reach the center the staff is polite and kind the room was wide clean and had a nice view on kingsway everything was as good as i expected it to be hope to have the chance to spend some days there again in the near future all my friends think alike viviana
