this hotel is in a perfect and quiet location for our recent theatre break we were able to walk everywhere as covent garden a min walk away and museums and oxford st only a little further only needed the tube to visit the shard will definitely visit again modern and clean and plenty of very helpful staff and excellent restaurant
