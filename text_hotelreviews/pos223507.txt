location right across the park which is great if you have young children coram play park was just minutes walk away as well great for business central but in a quiet little area staff friendly accommodating helpful approachable i breastfed and worked in one of the meeting rooms and it felt like a home away from home room moderate but good for london and price loved the free coffee as well
