easy access to metro from cadet easy to all other transport the staff anthony frank and girls at reception where just great to talk to and they just went out of the way to make you comfortable the rooms are just brilliant with the hotel theme running threw the whole hotel to corridors as well gives you that parisian feel and calming from the moment you walk in would go back in a heart beat thanks for the memories
