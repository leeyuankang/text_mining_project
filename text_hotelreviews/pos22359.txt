i really loved the theme of the decoration writers that was a real plus and the downstairs lounge with the honesty bar is chic and comfortable and it was extremely pleasant to have a drink on the small terrace the location is absolutely terrific if you want to go shopping it is very very close to the rue des martyrs which is a true gourmet gully our room was also wonderfully quiet
