great location convenient for cadet metro station and many restaurants etc just a short walk to monmatre and other tourist destinations the hotel felt safe and secure but relaxed staff were present and available to help if required but not intrusive great housekeeping essential for me to enjoy a stay rooms were well decorated and comfortable no problems at all staying here i would recommend and wish to return one day
