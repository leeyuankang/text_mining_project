great location just min from holborn station lots of bus and train options to anywhere in london very comfortable and good size room very quiet even though our room faced onto the main street even though breakfast is not included in the room rate there was still fruit and muesli bars available each morning and snacks biscuits in the afternoon also lots of great breakfast options just outside the hotel
