this is so rare to find a hotel this good in the uk you d never dream that service staff and facilities are this clean comfortable usable and pleasant to my biggest surprise food and coffee were great i stay in many hotels and uk hotels for the most part are squalid places which don t even compare to the worst east european hostel this one on the other hand ranks with the best star hotels in europe your staff bring in an exotic flair to the hotel and if anything you should treasure them give them a raise and praise them they make this place incredible and i will certainly return
