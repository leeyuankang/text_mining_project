we loved this place great location in the theatre district lovely staff a nice snack drink bar in the lobby a warm and inviting lobby bottles of water that were complementary in the lobby and on each floor we felt that the security was top notch since key cards were needed to get into to the building and to run the elevators clean and comfy room with a nice tv and free wifi every type of cuisine was right around the corner and we were close enough to our show to walk to the theatre
