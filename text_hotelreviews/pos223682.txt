we stayed for one night at this hotel to enable us to see an opera at covent garden and not have the hassle of travelling home immediately afterwards the hotel was quiet and perfectly located within a short walking distance of both the opera house and other theatres for that matter and the sir john soanes museum the room was relatively spacious the free coffee tea and wifi welcome and the breakfast menu good
