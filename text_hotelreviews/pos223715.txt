they have an unlimited supply of coffee for their guests fro proper coffee machines which is amazing they kept our bag for us for a charge of for days after departure this was helpful as we were going for a trip to scotland and carrying and extra suitcase would be strenuous although the receptionist had first told us that it was okay to keep the suitcase but at check out the other receptionist refused to keep it on requesting the manager we could keep suitcase in the hotel at the extra charge so there is poor communication between the staff
