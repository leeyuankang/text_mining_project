i tend to stay at clubquarters regularly on business trips and i have to assure you of the high quality at all their establishments in particular i find lincoln s inn fields as well as the st paul s to be the very best at lincoln s inn the graciousness and professionalism of all the staff especially at reception is very impressive usually in a hotel there are one or two people who make a special effort but at club quarters it seems everyone makes a special effort all the team are on the same page and this is so excellent i was made to feel relaxed at all times and everything was done with precision grace and kindness now this is the sign of a well managed team whomsoever is managing these two establishments should be very proud indeed of all their staff the hotels and facilities i cannot find fault and i have stayed in many hotels impressive
