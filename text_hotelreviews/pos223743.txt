perfectly located in a quiet area over looking the park and around the corner from holborn underground station staff friendly welcoming and helpful rooms clean and nicely decorated liked the dark patterned duvet covers rather than the usual hospital like white that is more the norm for hotels now great having plastic bottles and water machines on each floor as well as the complimentary hot drinks and biscuits at reception
