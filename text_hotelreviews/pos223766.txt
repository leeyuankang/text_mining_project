great location minutes walk to holborn tube station directly connected to the famous areas such as covent garden a few stops to oxford street stations the hotel itself is in a quiet area of lincoln s inn fields the rooms are quiet for a good rest i love the modernity the cleanliness the completeness of bedroom facility the beds i stayed in rooms on different days were firm enough but not hard and really comfortable small queen room is big enough for two maybe bigger than average rooms in london excellent wifi in the rooms they have free computer facility on the groundfloor to access internet print documents like tickets and maps free
