incredibly helpful staff particularly having arrived from australia after a hour trip and booking in earlier than check in time we were given the option of an interim room to rest and shower this really made all the difference to our outlook for the rest of the stay also the staff didn t know this but one of my children is epileptic episodes often triggered by tiredness sleep deprivation so being offered a room to eat within was a real luxury
