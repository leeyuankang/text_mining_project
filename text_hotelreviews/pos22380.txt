everything was very clean staff was extremely friendly and helpful and spoke english well a plus since my french is nonexistent two tips eat breakfast downstairs instead of getting room service more food for less this hotel is not close to the seine we walked over an hour to the eiffel tower this is nice because it is very quiet and inexpensive but be prepared to walk a lot or take taxis
