very close to a tube stop holborn queen superior room was huge lots of space to unload luggage and relax staff allowed us to checkin early and checkout late at instead of in room coffee was provided and restocked everyday first time getting to hotel was interesting because all the streets around the park are actually lincoln inn fields road rather than just one of them we walked around the whole park on accident before we found the hotel oops
