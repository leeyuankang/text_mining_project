the hotel is well appointed and in a great location for the london sights the double glazing is quite effective in keeping out the traffic noise but saying that if your on the front of the hotel this isn t an issue the hotel is a minute walk from the central line and a minute walk from covent garden the restaurant looks good if a little expensive but there are lots of places close by to suit most pockets
