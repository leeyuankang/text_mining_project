fantastic quiet location at the heart of london near the theatre district with fast and easy access from eurostar st pancras international train station just two metro stops away i had booked a twin room and it was very comfortable modern and clean with a separate corner sofa and table for london standards the room was wonderfully spacious the hotel amenities were also excellent there is a free high speed wi fi throughout the hotel work stations in the room and near the lobby and unlimited access to coffee tea and chilled bottled water i will definitely use this hotel in the future as well
