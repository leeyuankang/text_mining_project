i can t fault this hotel we had really a clean nice room and thank you for the upgrade with the same price because of valentines day staff are very approachable and helpful at reception bar and restaurant little touch like a refill of filter water with bottle next to the elevator and pantry full of free toiletries was very convenient location was very close to high street shops cafe pubs supermarket bars and restaurants and also holborn underground station definitely coming back to book this hotel again
