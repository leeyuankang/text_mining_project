my husband and i visited club quarters lincolns inn field to celebrate valentine s weekend and we were very impressed having been fortunate enough to stay in several and star hotels in our amazing capital city its great to find another hotel tucked away in a quiet spot which i would recommend we visited london to see motown the musical another must see if you are lucky enough to be in town which transports you to an era of great music stopping at one feel good song after another shaftesbury theatre is a minute walk from the hotel the hotel has a brilliant location away from the hustle and bustle but within walking distance of covent garden oxford street and bond street so fab for shopping all of the staff were very helpful and friendly and free tea coffee fruit and sweets in the lounge a nice little extra we had a queen room which over looked the pretty lincolns inn field green i am looking forward to returning to have a cocktail on the terrace in the summer
