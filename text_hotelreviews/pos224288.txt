great location excellent friendly staff and nice spacious clean rooms newly renovated with all the modern conveniences like usb ports and a large flat screen tv had two rooms on the club level which is below ground level therefore there were no windows the trade off is that the rooms were about larger than the standard room i personally prefer having more space than having a view another bonus was that there was a complimentary coffee tea water station right outside of the room very convenient i was able to grab my first cup of coffee without getting out of my pjs at the club level there is an elevator that takes you to the kingsway entrance to the hotel which is in the back of the building this saved us from having to walk all the way around to the the front entrance
