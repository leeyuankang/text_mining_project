excellent location in central london hotel is of excellent quality and a very easy check in and check out process room was modern and has some nice features like usb charging points staff were incredibly helpful and could not do enough to help having filtered water machines in the corridors with bottles provided to fill yourselves is a great touch free coffee and tea facilities in reception area as well as onsite resturant had problems ordering food late at night but the helpful guy on reception sorted that out for me with no complaints etc and food delivered direct to the room what excellent service
