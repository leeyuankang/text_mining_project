was very surprised i was allowed in my room when i arrived at just after that s got to be the earliest check in i ve ever had great for dropping off heavy luggage so i didn t have to drag them round london ideal for an over night stay and really nice to have seating outside especially in such lovely weather good walking distance to shops covent garden and theatres good little touch to have bottles ready to fill with water on tap instead of sitting in the rooms
