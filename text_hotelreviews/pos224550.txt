really enjoyed our stay at the novotel paris the staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly especially the concierge he went out of his way to help us and we didn t even buy any tickets off of him because we had them booked before hand not because we are mean lol the location is also a major plus as you can walk to the eiffel tower in mins but you have a metro less than mins away we would really recommend the novotel paris its fab and the beds are really comfortable
