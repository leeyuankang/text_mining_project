location was fantastic everyone on staff was super friendly and helpful ernesto in particular stood out we had a west facing room and the view was great i liked how bright and sunny the large windows made the room feel even though they didn t open the air conditioning worked well enough to keep the place comfortable plenty of space in the room for our family to have a small breakfast and get cozy at night to hang out and or watch some tv
