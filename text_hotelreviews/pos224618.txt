the staff were fantastic we asked to change room as my little one didn t like the floor and it was no problem at all john the housekeeper introduced himself and made sure we were all ok we arrived in the evening and by the time we had checked in it was dark so the eiffle tower was lit up the hotel looked out onto the river and just a minute or two to walk the base of the eiffle tower where music and street markets made it an amazing evening
