loved the location turn right for the eiffel tower left for the shopping restaurants trains etc great location minute walk to the eiffel tower the balcony to the front of the hotel you could sit with a drink and see the eiffel tower bonus when it twinkles with the lights very amazing also a brilliant sushi restaurant on the way to the eiffel tower highly recommend
