our twin room was very comfortable and quiet even though it was near the elevator we were on the floor facing west so we had a nice view of the sunset and the statue of liberty on the seine the hotel is well located near the bir hakeim and charles michel metro stops and is across the bridge from the bus which goes along the seine to most major sights it s not fancy but it was fine for our independent stay of two nights and three additional nights with our tour group
