best location very close to eiffel tower just minute walk closest metro is like minutes by walk hotel is very new rooms are huge very clean many cafe s and restaurants around there is a shopping centre just next to hotel rooms are quite and soundproof not with many kids of children internet speed is very good as well the view was amazing make sure to take a higher floor room from the river side some rooms will have both the city view and the river view
