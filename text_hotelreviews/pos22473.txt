location is perfect less than minute walk to the metro and the louvre front desk staff was very friendly and helpful rooms are probably average for paris which most americans would consider small but well appointed and comfortable very clean the air conditioning is a huge bonus in the summer breakfast is overpriced for what it is but very convenient
