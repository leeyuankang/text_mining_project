lovely room good size very clean with lovely view over the river seine staff very friendly slight issue when checking in with room not being ready despite arriving after the earliest check in time offered an alternative which was not suitable but issue resolved and we got the room we booked breakfast had sufficient choice for us but quite busy overall a pleasant stay location not far too walk to the eiffel tower would definitely stay here again
