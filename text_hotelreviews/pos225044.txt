the rooms are small and the corridor and lift very narrow infact the hotel is very very small unlike the pictures which give an illusion of grandeur the hotel is also not easy to locate near to metro which is a plus very modern and friendly staff we had a good stay just the size of hotel that was a little setback but great value for our money in paris i might return i recommend it if you want a good clean place to retire to each night
