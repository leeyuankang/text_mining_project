the room was very small ok for a couple without much luggage or a single person we upgraded to a family suite the bedroom was a little larger we had a cute living room with a tv and wind that looked out onto the street parking wasn t so easy but we managed metro is about minutes walk the line takes you directly to champs elysee very convienent for us the staff were very helpful we didnt have breakfast or eat in the hotel so can t comment lift is exceptionally tiny so had to do relays with our large suitcases yes we would stay there again
