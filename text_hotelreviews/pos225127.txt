we had a wonderful stay at hotel monsieur the location was so central and close to attractions yet removed enough to make you still feel like you re in a local area the rooms were incredibly spacious not at all what we were expecting given past stays in tiny european hotel rooms and the decor alternates from one room to another guaranteeing a truly boutique and artsy experience we loved the breakfast and the bespoke teas left in our room every evening definitely a fabulous spot to enjoy a parisian vacation felt super upscale an chic without breaking the bank
