the staff was wonderfully kind smiley and helpful comfy bed lovely terrace nice shower the room was small but you d expect that in paris nicely decorated and cosy perfect location very central and nice area but rooms are still very quiet breakfast was really good don t expect a massive choice of dishes very good quality products less is more in that case all in all very good value for money especially for paris
