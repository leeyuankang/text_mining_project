the bed was comfortable and no matter what time of day it was with the curtains closed it was pitch black best blackout curtains ever the complimentary cake and drinks each day was a lovely touch also the staff were ever so kind and went above and beyond the location was perfect we walked everywhere and it was super quiet for a city can t complain the maid cleaned up when we popped out briefly even after we had spent all afternoon in the room we didn t expect that at all we didn t require it but she still did it and the cleaning products they use make the bathroom sparkle it was super clean you can have the hammam to yourself too which is great for privacy
