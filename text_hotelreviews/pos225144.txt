we were able to check in early which we so appreciated since we flew all night and were anxious to freshen up the hotel was near the train station gare st lazare where we took a train ride to normandy our room was lovely and nicely air conditioned which was most appreciated as it was extremely hot during our stay in paris we had a lovely little balcony as well as a modern bathroom with a hair dryer and magnified mirror the neighborhood had everything we needed and was in a very safe neighborhood as we walked back from the train station after pm the ladies at the desk were most helpful
