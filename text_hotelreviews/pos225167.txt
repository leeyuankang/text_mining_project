very nice atmosphere super friendly staff clean fresh chic and quiet close to the opera and the department stores but also on a walking distance from rue saint honore and lots of good connections to the rest of the city loved my stay and would definitely recommend it to others i went to visit a friend and also to participate in the paris marathon which the hotel is perfectly situated for a min trip on the rer or a easy km warm up walk to the start line
