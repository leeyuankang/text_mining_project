my family and i booked the triple room at hotel monsieur and it was super comfortable the room was huge by parisian standards and was more of a suite including a terrace perfect for breakfast not that advantageous in winter though when we were there the bath is the best the shower head is strong we also had a nespresso machine the location is perfect for shoppers since haussmann and galeries lafayette are a close walk away saint augustin station is about meters away and includes a line that is well connected to almost all the main lines all in all the room and the hotel are very nice a fresh change from all the hotels around paris with the outdated styles and the rust highly recommended thanks to the hotel monsieur team
