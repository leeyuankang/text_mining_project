we absolutely loved this charming little hotel although the room was small it was beautifully decorated and the bed was so comfortable the view was down into the charming little courtyard all the staff was super friendly and helpful during our stay we loved that we could see the top of the eiffel tower by simply turning our head oh and you simply must try the bakery right next door heaven
