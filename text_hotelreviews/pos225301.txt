the location is great for walking all over paris except that right across the street is a pub i love being on saint dominique and being just down the street from the eiffel tower the pub is so noisy at night it makes it very hard to sleep the pub customers come outside to smoke so the smoke carries up into the hotel rooms across the street when the pub closes at night people are outside talking while waiting for uber rides the pub and other businesses get many deliveries during the night so it ends up being a very noisy place to stay
