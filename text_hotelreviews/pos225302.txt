hotel is perfectly located in the heart of paris less than a minute walk from the louvre and from d orsay stunning views of the eiffel tower can be seen along the street and i recommend getting a hotel room with the view of the street as you can see the spectacular light display on the eiffel tower the hotel is located near metro stations which are easy to use considering i can t even get around london underground got from eurostar to the hotel within minutes furthermore the hotel has loads of nearby bakeries and local shops which are reasonably cheap the hotel receptionists were very helpful and provided me with an ipad during my stay they were very informative and allowed us to bring back food when we didn t fancy going out for dinner the room was very clean and they provided a dressing gown towels slippers and other everyday essentials which you probably wouldn t take on holiday overall the hotel was brilliant and was definitely worth the money being that it was in the middle of everything and this was great overall highly recommend la terrasse which is a lovely little place to for evening dinner overall the hotel was lovely and the views was magnificent highly recommend
