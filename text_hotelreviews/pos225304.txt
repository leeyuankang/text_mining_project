staff were very friendly and very helpful especially if you don t speak french i found the hotel at a fantastic location minutes walk from eiffel tower close to shops bars and restaurants i loved how there was an irish bar across from the hotel makes it feel like we didn t leave home rooms were very clean and tidy beds made everyday i like how if you arrive early before check in you can leave you bags at hotel same goes for check out if you have a late flight you can leave your bags and collect later on there is some fantastic shops beside the arc de triomphe good for shopping food restaurant and places around the hotel are cheap enough you just have too look around i also liked the fact there was a late check out it s fantastic as it gives you a chance to relax while finishing to pack instead of stressing getting ready by a certain time can t wait to return
