the staff were very friendly and helpful our room was lovely not the largest but as we really only slept in it it wasn t a problem there was a coffee machine available although we didn t use it and the mini bare had free soft drinks in it the bed was lovely and comfortable the location was great minutes walk to the eifel tower
