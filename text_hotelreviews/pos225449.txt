the hotel was clean and pretty comfortable the staff were really nice they upgraded us to a room with a cup coffee maker which was great to have in the morning we didn t spend a load of time in the hotel as we were using it just as a base after a night out but the bed was comfortable the room quiet and the shower was lovely it is much more of business focused hotel in my opinion but serviced us well for the night
