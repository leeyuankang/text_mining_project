coming from the west the location was great and the ease of being able to pull straight in and park under the hotel not too expensive either for hours a very short walk to gunnersbury tube taking me directly to the embankment in the morning really easy when i booked it was for a superior double which made it excellent value however when i tried to book again for the following week it had doubled in price which made it not at all good value so i went elsewhere
