room was really comfortable with a huge bed gorgeous bathroom it was conveniently situated for our needs on this particular trip but rooms overlook either a busy road or in our case a large honda dealership you don t go there for views the soundproofing is excellent though both against the outside world between rooms the buffet breakfast is better than many being both well presented offering a good variety of what was tasty food particularly good sausages the fresh fruit was really good too
