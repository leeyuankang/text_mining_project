we used this hotel as a base to travel into central london for the weekend by underground and it worked out very well gunnersbury district line station is only a few minutes walk away and with a visitor oyster card the tube worked out quite inexpensive we parked in the hotel car park for per hours which is not bad for london prices our room was large comfortable clean and quiet with a very nice bathroom we would definitely do this again
