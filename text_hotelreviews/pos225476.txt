it was a very special milestone birthday when i eventually got to my room early hours of the morning after celebrating at my birthday party there were birthday banners put up for me a birthday cake champagne chilled i was so touched and appreciative for the attention and acknowledgment and it was nice to be able to sit down and take in the night celebrations i was so busy being the hostess i didn t get the chance to really party the way i would have hoped i didn t even have a drink so it was really really lovely to exhale have a nice drink and enjoy the moment staff everyone at the hotel are extremely lovely breakfast complimentary also for my birthday treat late checkout i cannot fault anything they aimed to accommodate everything they enabled to make my big celebration even more special
