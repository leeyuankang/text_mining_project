what s not to like about this hotel rooms are large with lovely showers rooms although some have baths with shower the newer standard rooms are smaller but beautifully decorated such a relaxing place to stay breakfast is lovely too with an amazingly large choice recommend the vitality breakfast food in the restaurant and bar great and good value the staff are so attentive and friendly it is my favourite place to stay in london now i have found it and i have stayed in very many now i am sorry i have given this revue because i am finding it increasingly hard to book a room it very quickly gets booked out will probably be harder now
