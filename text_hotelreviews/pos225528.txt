first time at this hotel and we think it would be a great choice if flying out from heathrow as the tube station is just over the road and only a few stops from the airport there is a bus stop right outside the door for public transport links we found the hotel to be modern clean and contemporary our bedroom was very spacious and the bathroom was enormous with a walk in shower and huge stand alone bathtub the breakfast was excellent with such a huge variety to choose from and all was of excellent quality fresh fruits smoothies porridge cereals yogurts pastries continental selection and a gluten free selection it was a self service buffet but waiter service for tea coffee and any special requests e g omelettes poached eggs ect we stayed at the clayton in dublin last year and this too was an excellent choice and of a very good standard it seemed popular with couples families and solo travellers
