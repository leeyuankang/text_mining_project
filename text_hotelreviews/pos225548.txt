the breakfast was exceptional even though we also had to pay each extra for it i had seen it advertised within the hotel website as breakfast free after we had agreed to pay the location was extremely good for getting out and about on the tube the hotel itself was nice and had plenty of public seating areas to relax in a pleasant bar with good parking space underneath it although it was quite expensive at a night
