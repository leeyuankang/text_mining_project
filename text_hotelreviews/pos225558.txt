what a lovely hotel the rooms were fresh clean large comfortable with excellent shower the bed was a good size and comfortable the tv was large there was no noise from neighbouring room its a short walk to gunnersby tube station so no bother at all we parked in undergound hotel car park with ease good size although annoying alot of the spaces were reserved plugs next to the bed which was a huge positive love to put phone on charge next to me
