i liked the bathroom spacious with minimalistic but not harsh style perfect i liked the decoration and the color scheme in the room tasteful without being over the top the atmosphere was elegant serene and warm a very quiet room safe pleasant location and near to the tube we had a very happy stay in your hotel
