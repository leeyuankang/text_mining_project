perfect quiet spot close to champs elysees we visited during the easter break a family of four and got two deluxe rooms on the floor charming old style lift that was very efficient the staff were very helpful accommodating and attentive especially mehdhat who helped us from our first step into the hotel to getting us into the taxi as we left the hotel was classic and very comfortable the rooms were huge by european standards and both had small balconies as well at the lobby there was all day bread snacks drinks available which was perfect for a quick bite before or after a day of shopping sightseeing the lounge bar area was a beautiful place with a terrific skylight perfect to chill out with a beer and some conversation the minibar in the room is consumable water soft drinks juice a rarity these days which they kept it stocked on daily basis if you need other items there was a small convenience store just a couple minutes away it was a great place away from the bustle and noise of champs elysees and just minute walk away from shopping
