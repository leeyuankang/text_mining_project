amazing hotel that recognises loyalty great staff that dont chase you for tips every mins exceptional housekeeping bar prices are standard breakfast is great food in general needs work big league mostly decent but should be better more consistent when head chef cooking amazing not so much otherwise easily one of my very favourite hotels in the world i will certainly be back
