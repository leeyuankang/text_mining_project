we liked the beautiful interior and friendly staff the hotel is in a great location close to all the sites and metro the complimentary afternoon tea coffee and snacks in the lovely lounge area is a nice way to rest your tired legs and energize for the evening a room on the floor will give you a view of the eiffel tower
