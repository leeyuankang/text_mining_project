the room where they put us was in the new building everything new and looking stunning the bed extra comfy and i requested some roses for a romantic decoration and they have done it for me the breakfast wasn t included in the room price but was not a problem to have breakfast there and we paid as an extra expenses the breakfast is a buffet and honestly they had everything what the mind will desire for a morning breakfast
