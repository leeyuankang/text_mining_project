it is just a few mins from gunnersbury station and walking distance to shops restaurants and supermarket the neighbourhood is neat and safe the room is big but i don t think it is as big as the rooms are probably newly renovated because everything look new and clean there is a mini fridge iron and a powerful hairdryer the lobby also look nice and modern
