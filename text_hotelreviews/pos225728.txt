despite the hotel being given a big makeover including extensive building work we did not feel really inconvenienced by this and the staff did everything they could to make our stay a good one this included an upgrade to our room on arrival the room we were given was in the new wing of the hotel and had a sumptuous bed and furnishings and a luxury ensuite can t comment on food or bar as we didn t use these really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again
