staff were very friendly upon arrival and throughout our stay the room was a good size and very clean although i was worried about the renovation work that was going on and visible from the outside from the inside we did not see any sign of work going on and didn t hear any noise from it at all less than minutes walk to gunnersbury station and minute walk to chiswick house so ideal for what we wanted
