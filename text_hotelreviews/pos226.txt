although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding the hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space i was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside fantastic value for money but i assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in amsterdam the bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite the hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of amsterdam in only minutes
