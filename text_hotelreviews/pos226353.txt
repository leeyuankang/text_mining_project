nice modern hotel well situated opposite a tube station reception staff were very polite and efficient room was comfortable bed a bit firm for me but you can t please everyone and the touch pad for the room controls was good very intuitive breakfast was tasty and plentiful and they allowed us to leave our car in their carpark for a few hours after we checked out so that we could do some sight seeing
