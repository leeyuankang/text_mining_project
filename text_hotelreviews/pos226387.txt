the hotel is still brand new and modern the staff is so friendly and helpful it is right in front of the underground station of park royal which takes u directly to central london in less than min as for the breakfast there is quite a nice variety of food ranging from scrambled eggs to cheese and juices and fruits etc it is worth every penny i spent
