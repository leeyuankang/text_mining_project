we loved staying at this brand new hotel it was absolutely beautiful from the entrance to our room we felt very welcomed by tara who greeted us on arrival she also asked if we were staying for an occasion and it was for my partner s birthday later on that day when we came back to our hotel room tara had wrote such a lovely card along with a gorgeous piece of birthday cake it made our stay extra special we would personally like to thank her for all her effort and acknowledgement we also went down for dinner at the restaurant which again was absolutely amazing the restaurant was beautifully laid out and we cannot explain how good the food was as well as the customer service
