the hotel is very new modern and comfortable reception was open hours which makes it ideal if travelling inter city to london in the evening after work parking was per night which is comparable if not cheaper then other hotels in the area we selected this hotel primarily because of its proximity to the london underground park royal station is a min walk making it very easy to get into central london room was modern and lighting and temperature could be controlled entirely by an access panel on each bedside table facilities were very clean and the bed was very comfortable
