the hotel is right next to the tube station which has lines to central london the hotel overall is extremely modern the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating strangely although it is next to a busy road it s dead quiet obviously a good thing we went to a show in hammersmith this hotel was completely convenient for that and really reasonably priced compared to other hotels it is a bit far out for central london mins tube however close to west london e g hammersmith chelsea fulham area we stayed for one night and would highly recommend it and stay again in the future
