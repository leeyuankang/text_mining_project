after traveling around europe paris is our last stop we re already tired when we arrived at the hotel but the gentleman at the reception greeted us warmly and cheerfully they are very helpful professional also i emailed the hotel about clothes iron if they have a month ago and when we arrived at the room it s already there the rooms are always clean and this one is very important for me it smells nice when we arrive and the bed is comfortable biotherm toiletries are also provided so you don t have to bring your own if you re picky the breakfast was awesome and they have an open bar all day location is perfect around mins walking distance to the louvre
