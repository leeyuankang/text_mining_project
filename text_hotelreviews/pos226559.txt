this hotel looks to have been refurbished recently and was quite pleasant the room was clean and fairly modern the room and the bathroom were very clean the shower was decent enough i had a decent nights sleep even with the busy road right outside the wifi at this hotel was excellent as was the wired internet available in the rooms the air conditioning was also very good and was a life saver given how hot it was during my stay
