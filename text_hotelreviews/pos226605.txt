the palm hotel is on the main road but we had a quieter room at the back which was good we could use our room from as they had one free nothing was too much trouble the bathroom was newly renovated with our favourite type of shower plenty of towels toiletries bathmat and slipmat if you needed although the room was double glazed the window would open wide walking distance hampstead heath and transport links to north and central london good selection on menu good price pleasant service well cooked well presented meal excellent choice at breakfast
