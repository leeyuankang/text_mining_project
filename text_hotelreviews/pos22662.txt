absolutely stunning hotel in great location of london loved our room it was beautifully designed the staff of the hotel was amazing especially a guy really sorry but i have no clue how his name is spelled but smth like dwuart from portugal was exceptionally helpful and welcoming each time he saw us we also received a beautiful dessert and a card from the hotel due to our anniversary melted my heart
