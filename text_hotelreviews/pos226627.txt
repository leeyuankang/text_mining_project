all of the staff are extremely helpful and welcoming an error with my booking was promptly fixed i was given a lower floor near the entrance the restaurant was a triumph waiters attentive and the food excellent especially the hake overall for the price the hotel is faultless but for its current permanent builder clientele and their leave in their vans trucks noisily at returning to fill up the car park before and prop up the bar en mass from shame
