the parking at the hotel is excellent with spaces lined up on the front of the hotel and more secure spaces around the back behind an electric gate the hotel was nice and the reception staff and restaurant staff extremely polite and helpful the rooms are really modern and with nicely presented and well equipped modern bathrooms a great hotel for the money
