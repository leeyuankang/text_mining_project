we absolutely adored everything i travelled with my assistant we had to film in tbn television studios the next day and even though there was a wedding in the building you really couldn t tell they put us in a gorgeous room there was no traffic to disturb us we had such a quiet and peaceful night the staff was so warm welcoming and receptive and there were uniformed gentlemen there to carry our bags and suitcases we could want for nothing all our needs were taken care of the lobby and room was beautiful i couldn t recommend it enough and i will definitely stay there again
