the night receptionist was really helpful and the morning receptionist seemed friendly the beds were comfy and the room a good size for two adults i was dubious about how well the curtains would shut out the light as i like to sleep in absolute darkness but they didn t disappoint at all with regards to the location we were coming back from a wedding outside london so it was ok for us but if you are coming from abroad you may want to stay closer to the city and not on a very busy road where the entrance is all in all i liked the hotel modern features but still has old ish decor very clean and bathroom a good enough size the walk in shower is very spacious and had two different types of shower heads oh la la i prefer showers to baths so this was perfect for me
