very clean and nice decorated rooms so friendly and solution oriented staff good location although it seems far away from the city center when look at the location there is no problem in transportation you can use both metro and bus to reach the center in min number bus stops in front of the hotel and takes you directly to the end of the oxford street number and takes you directly to the golders green metro station in min
