the manager ivana was great when i complained of an issue relating to a stench in my bathroom she took time to hear me out and even went with me to see for herself and finally gave me a percent discount for the discomfort i hope that the problem will be fixed asap and to all the other staff that had smiles on their faces to make our stay more welcoming we say thank you the meal served for the party was sumptuous as well kudos to the chef of the day
