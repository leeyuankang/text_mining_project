i much prefer the warm interior of this hotel to that of the bland holiday inn front desk staff are always friendly happy to lend lend a helping hand as an example we were worried about the weight of our suitcases and mentioned this to the staff as we were checking out and they immediately brought a weighing scale from behind the desk to our car so we could weigh our cases there and then with a car the hotel is ideal in london free parking with easy access to brent cross shopping mall min drive golders green min drive and the nearby finchley road providing quick access to both central london and other areas wi fi is a blistering speed as long as you don t upload large file sizes videos to youtube then it begins to slow down rapidly i only wish other hotels at a considerably higher price point would learn from best western on their wi fi policy
