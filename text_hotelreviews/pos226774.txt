customers service was really good face to interaction to fix any problem instead of telling what to do on the phone hotel looks great from the outside and rooms was so nice all the way to the bathroom i loved the robes and slippers provided made me feel like i was at home i also liked that they had sky tv service and was able to watch the standard sky package
