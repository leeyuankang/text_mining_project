jade on reception was vey helpful and sorted out a different room as we didn t like the one we were originally in they also pre warned a taxi firm that we might want picking up from wembley stadium so when we called at the taxi firm knew about us and were there within minutes even though it was horrendous traffic outside the stadium very clean and staff very helpful
