the service was fantastic i was relocated to the grand lancaster gate around the corner due to some problems they were very helpful counting with a staff of young profesional people always with a smile on their faces the bed was very comfortable my room was kind of small but did not mind was good for me and for one weekend they welcome you with a fruit drink breakfast was good enough for sure a hotel to come back and to recomend
