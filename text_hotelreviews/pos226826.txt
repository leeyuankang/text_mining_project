had a wonderful stay at this hotel week ago i had read the reviews before i went and i was thinking that the hotel was going to be awful i can honestly say that the hotel was lovely arrived at plenty of parking and was able to check in and go to our room which was amazing after a hour drive to the hotel was not expecting this at all there are a lot of reviews saying that it s in the middle of nowhere and the train station is a minute walk although it s true about the train station there is a bus stop just outside the hotel and takes you directly to the train station all you need is google maps on your phone and you are set staff were very friendly and helpful and considering parking is free i was not complaining that the train station was so far away especially when the bus runs every minutes breakfast was great plenty of choice and staff were always there to help and were always bringing out lots of food room very comfortable and bigger than expecting with a fridge in the room which was a bonus loved the shower as it was a rain shower and there were always clean towels both nights we stayed there could not fault this hotel as the price was amazing for the nights we stayed and will definitely be staying here again
