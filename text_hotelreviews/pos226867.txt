room was reasonable but to expensive for what it was parking was bad on the saturday night due to a function but i was informed that guest s did not have priority over people that were not staying but were attending the function and was told i would have to park on one of the surrounding streets this i thought was poor considering i had paid pounds for a night stay whilst my wife was in hospital and considering i have used this hotel on a regular basis over the last months and have always found it good
