the hotel and staff are lovely we arrived to early for check in but the lovely staff were happy for us to leave our car in the car park at back the room was big comfortable and with free parking and only for the night who can complain the hotel also let us leave our car in the car park the next day until later when we were ready to travel home very reasonable prices compared to other hotels and free parking unlike other hotels it s only walk to tube station or can walk minutes and get a bus which takes you straight to the tube station there s a shopping centre about drive away and a hour tesco so the location i would say is good the hotel doesn t look much from the outside but once inside its lovely
