well appointed hotel within easy reach of public transport clean and comfortable and remarkably quiet given its location on a busy dual carriageway excellent breakfast staff friendly and helpful unfortunately we had cause to complain about unpleasant odours in two separate rooms the staff handled our complaint well and on both occasions we were moved promptly into a different room overall excellent value for money we would definitely stay again
