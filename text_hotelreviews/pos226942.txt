friendley atmosphere and a warm welcome and the staff helped with every thing we asked rooms were very comfortable and cleaned to perfection and the day after rooms serviced to a very high standard adequate parking space and travelling to the city by bus the stop was a minutes walk to it i can t think of one fault and this is good for me as i worked as a chambermaid in london for over eight years and ended up as a deputy head house keeper so standards mean a lot to me definetley recommend to friends and family
