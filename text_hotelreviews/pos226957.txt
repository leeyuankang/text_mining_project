the executive double was very large and well appointed the parking was adequate and secure the free wifi was excellent with no codes or login the hotel is a good mins walk or mins if you walk fast like me from the tube and there are buses nearby it is a largely residential area there are shops and restaurants near the station in golder s green if i wanted a hotel for london again i wouldn t hesitate to book this one
