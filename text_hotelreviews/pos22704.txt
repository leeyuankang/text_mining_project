this hotel has a beautiful contemporary style very new and very stylish from the moment i walked up to the hotel it was a fabulous experience the door man was pleasant and very welcoming the greeter downstairs was very warm and asked to take my bags immediately i was shown up to the first floor reception area where i was checked in at the fastest pace the person checking me in was very nice and told me everything i needed to know when i got to the room within a couple of mins the door knocked and my bag was delivered the person talked me through all the hidden aspects of the room and said i could request any help i needed i felt very looked after i didn t want to leave and had the best sleep in a hotel in central london in ages i could not hear anything from outside i will definitely be revisiting this hotel if i could give it stars i would every bit of the experience was lovely
