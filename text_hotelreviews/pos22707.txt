we stayed at the w hotel in leicester square for a period of days in conjunction with the semi final and finals weekend of the rugby world cup and used booking com for nights in addition to the three day packages that came with all blacks tours group the w hotel staff linked the various bookings together and also accommodated a reasonable upgrade to a studio room so that our son could join us for days for the rwc final all the staff from security on the front door to housekeeping were extremely friendly and helpful with any requests that plus a superb location adjacent to chinatown and nearby theatres and restaurants made for a perfect stay
