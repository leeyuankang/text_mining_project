the entire staff was welcoming from day until the last even the doormen would remember us the room we stayed in was the wonderful room and it was unique in design the closet like toilet and shower were very beautiful the bed was very comfortable as well i did happen to stay on the second floor near entrance side and did not hear one bit of noise as both the club and construction were literally at our doorstep three cheers for soundproofing overall a wonderful stay and would recommend to others looking to stay in downtown london as it is in the middle of all of it
