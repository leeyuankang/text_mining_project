the staff went out of their way to help make my stay very nice the location is central and very good if you are looking to see a show or walk to many sites it s in a very busy location though so if you are looking for something more relaxing you may want a different area upon arrival i was greeted with a welcome drink alcoholic or non and they offered me a bottle of water each time i came and went the front desk staff always engaged with me and asked if i needed anything
