this is by far the best hotel and location i ve found in london everything is within walking distance if you enjoy walking i only had to take the tube a couple of times the british and national gallery are super close it s possibly one of the most vibrant parts of the city to stay in anything you could need is around the corner pubs restaurants bars clubs movie theaters and theatres will definitely be staying there next time pricey but for london it was a great deal staff was super attentive and kind
