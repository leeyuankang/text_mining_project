excellent staff who were extremely helpful and friendly in particular this showed through when i had the unpleasant experience of watching them having to deal with a pretentious couple who were trying every trick in the book to try and get a free room upgrade the staff showed patience and professionalism that management should be proud of the rooms were excellent very clean and good quality fittings great location highly recommend
