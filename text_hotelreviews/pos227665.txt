the location is fantastic easy walking to picadilly and soho we used public transit a lot picadilly makes that very easy to get anywhere pretty quickly we used busses the river bus underground and overground using the oyster card my wife uses a wheel chair when we travel london on the whole is very accomodating the underground sometimes presents challenges because not all station have lifts
