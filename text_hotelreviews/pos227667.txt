room was small and quirky but well laid out with all expected items and more mini bar fresh fruit bottled water toiletries bed was comfortable great charging station for all electronics front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly location was great downtown piccadilly with theaters shops restaurants chinatown trafalgar square and the underground all within blocks i also enjoyed staying in a hotel that did not look like every other hotel in every other major city in the world the complementary glass of proseco upon arrival was a godsend as i was about to lose my mind after a long day of travel
