this was our second visit to this hotel within months it has all of the qualities that you would expect from a good star hotel but without the pretentiousness the service and staff are are exceptional nothing is too much trouble your every need catered for and always with a smile toiletries are elimis lovely coffee machine and tea making facilities complimentary bottled water and fruit every day complimentary proseco on arrival very comfortable bed so many little luxuries included in the price the food both breakfast and the indian tapas style menu is sumptuous the prices are far better than any local eatery but with better quality food i can t speak highly enough of this hotel don t forget to mention to the hotel when booking if you are celebrating a special occasion right in the centre of theatre land and china town this is by far the best hotel that we have stayed in in london i most definitely would only stay within the montcalm group whilst visiting london stayed april
