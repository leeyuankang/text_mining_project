the location was great right beside the queen s theatre within walking distance of loads of interesting locations and there is a great selection of restaurants nearby including those of chinatown which is directly opposite the hotel the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the food was excellent the tasty and freshly cooked breakfast was a great start to the day our room was clean and comfortable and although a little hot to begin with it was fine once we worked out how to control the heating our room overlooked shaftesbury avenue and had lovely big windows which let in lots of light it was a little noisy in spite of the double double glazing but we may have been a bit over sensitive to the traffic since we come from a peaceful hebridean island the en suite was a wee bit tight on space but the shower was great we really appreciated the miniature honesty shop in the wardrobe all in all a really positive experience for a first time visitor to london
