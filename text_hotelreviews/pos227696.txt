absolutely everything location is perfect and yet the room was silent you would not know you were right in the middle of central london room and facilities are excellent really nice gym and spa which totally made our stay after long days walking around absolutely the best thing about this hotel though is the staff they went completely above an beyond special thanks to andre who went out of his way a number of times to make our stay especially comfortable we spent two weeks in the uk and this was by far the best service we received from all the hotels we stayed at the staff really care about making it a special experience we will stay here every time from now on
