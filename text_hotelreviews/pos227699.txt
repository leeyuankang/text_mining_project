you can t miss the entrance on shaftesbury avenue because there s a massive flag flying above it we were offered a glass of prosecco on arrival the staff were very friendly and professional we were shown around our spotlessly clean room by a member of staff although it overlooked shaftesbury avenue it was quiet being on the floor the room had many facilities like tea and coffee making pod machine complementary fruit a mini bar fridge iron hairdryer big tv wifi etc etc it was the perfect base for taking in a show the reason for our visit and very central for all the other sights london has to offer we checked in stayed in the room for an hour or so then went out for the evening when we returned the bed had been re made which was nice we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for the whole day after we checked out so we didn t need to lug it around all day i would definitely stay at the piccadilly london west end again
