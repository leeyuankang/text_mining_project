from the first moment we walked into reception the service was superb we were warmly greeted with a glass of prosecco and very polite helpful personnel the hotel went above and beyond as when we returned to the room after a short walk they had decorated our room for my birthday and left some cake and chocolates special mention to katrina for making it a memorable stay definitely recommended and we will be back on our next visit to london caroline and steve
