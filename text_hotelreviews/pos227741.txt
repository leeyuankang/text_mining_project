everything was a little wary when booking as due to the excellent location thought may be rather a busy noisy hotel quite the opposite even though all rooms were booked it was so lovely and quiet i think actually the quietest night sleep i have had at a hotel amazing infact nothing we could fault maybe just that the rooms are smallish but immaculately clean and stylish huge telly comfy big bed sparkling shower room glass of bubbly on arrival we also love les mis and was literally doors away from the theatre also lots of places to eat drink in this area will be back soon that s for sure
