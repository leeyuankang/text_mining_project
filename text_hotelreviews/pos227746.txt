the location was perfect for us as we wanted to be close to trafalgar square for the winter run i was participating in the following day the hotel was modern and clean the staff were very friendly and attentive we thought the glass of prosecco at check in was a nice touch although we complained about being asked to move hotel the night before due to a computer error i refused and the horrendously small room size the lady at check out was very considerate and offered us a room discount and an offer to upgrade if we stay again
