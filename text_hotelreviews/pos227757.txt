although i didn t specify that i was celebrating a birthday i was delighted to find a decorated bed as well as a box of chocolates there were fresh flowers in the room too upon arrival the prosecco was a very welcome treat nothing was too much trouble for the staff and their customer service was excellent the location is exceptional and in very close proximity to the tube station fortnum masons as well as harrods were very easily accessed from this hotel we ate in some fabulous restaurants including the cork bottle and dalloway terrace the theatres are metres away we opted to see thriller the lyric theatre which is the best show that i ve ever seen we took advantage of the gym too just to take away some of the guilt of the over indulgence of our day stay
