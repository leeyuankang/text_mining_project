the free glass of bubbly on arrival got our stay off to a great start it was my wife s birthday on the day after we arrived and the hotel had upgraded us to a room with a four poster bed which they had decorated with a birthday message made of rose petals the birthday cake chocolates and balloons also made this a really memorable stay the hotel is wonderfully situated in the heart of theatreland within two minute walking access to piccadilly circus soho chinatown regent street and leicester square although the piccadilly is on busy shaftesbury avenue noise from the street wasn t a major issue for a city centre break this hotel s hospitality and location is hard to beat
