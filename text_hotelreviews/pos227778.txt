i loved everything from the moment we arrived we were welcomed in by friendly staff it was my birthday i was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us but got even better when i walked into our gorgeous room to find happy birthday in beautiful rose petals on the bed surrounded by balloons they had also kindly given me a box of chocolates and a large slice of cake it was delicious thank you all so much for a wonderful stay
