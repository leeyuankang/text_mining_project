first i have to say the staff were absolutely the best i have encountered especially alissa from checking in to out and all in between was seamless and unfailingly polite and helpful we felt very welcome there a free cell phone is given to you to help you navigate the city and to make calls how handy is that fresh flowers and fruit in the room along with a coffee maker and tea kettle were appreciated as well the rooms were roomy super clean spotless really as was the bathroom and shower box bed and pillows were so comfy the location was perfect for sightseeing just steps from chinatown many theaters piccadilly tube stations and great shopping loved it
