amazing hotel amazing location very small so no grand entrance but it s beautiful located right near the theatres staff can t do enough to help out and free glass of prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch breakfast is abit of a weird one it s basically next door and open to the public apart from the room being freezing cold the breakfast was gorgeous perfect hotel
