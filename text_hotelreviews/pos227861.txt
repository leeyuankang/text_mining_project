we arrived a little early hoping for an early check in as we had theatre tickets the staff greeted us with warm smiles chilled prosecco happily allowed an early check in we were upgraded to a club room which was exceptionally clean had everything we possibly needed elemis products in the bathroom fluffy pillows fully stocked mini bar snacks fresh fruit water the location was excellent for our trip and despite being central london the noise outside didn t disrupt us nothing was too much trouble for the staff who even took the time to compliment my dress as we were heading out for dinner they remembered which theatre we were going to even asked us about it on our return little touches make the difference this lovely little place has subtle luxury attention to detail nailed highly recommend
