the staff were amazing the first room i was given was at the front of the building and a little noisy from the traffic below and the room was on the small side as soon as i mentioned it they upgraded me immediately to another room which was quieter and much bigger everything i asked for such as a shaving kit help with the wifi they even collected food from a nearby restaurant and delivered it to our room as there was not the food we wanted on the room service menu
