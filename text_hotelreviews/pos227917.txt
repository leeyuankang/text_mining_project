we arrived after a very long tiring and disastrous day where i had made a mistake and booked a different hotel for the wrong date we the had to find an alternative at in the west end on a saturday not very easy however we found the piccadilly and was greeted by the welcoming smiley face of lyon who efficiently checked us in and served us a very much needed glass of cold prosecco as an arrival gesture we can t stress how lovely it was to be greeted by such a warm and friendly person and made to feel relaxed after such a bad day thank you lyon much appreciated
