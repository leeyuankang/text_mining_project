the complimentary prosecco on arrival was a great touch we had a wonderful comfortable stay and the location is perfect if you want to be in the heart of the west end we thought it might be too noisy at night as the hotel is directly on shaftesbury avenue and opposite china town but we had an amazing night s sleep we would definitely stay here again if wanting to stay central
