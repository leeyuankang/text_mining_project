great hotel amazing staff really friendly approachable and so helpful the room was on the top floor so great view of london we asked at the last minute to extend the stay and this was done really efficiently fresh fruit in the room was a nice touch as was the glass of bubbly on arrival we asked for a late check out no problem really could not fault the hotel or the great team of staff
