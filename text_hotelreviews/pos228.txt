this is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay there is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history also the shower was incredible
