the staff were all really lovely helpful and efficient my husband and i felt really welcomed and looked after the main thing that was important to us was the nearness of the hotel to the queens theatre where we had tickets for les miserables we came out of the theatre after the performance and were in our warm room less than five minutes later perfect all the room facilities were just right the bathroom in particular was lovely with under floor heating and a roomy shower
