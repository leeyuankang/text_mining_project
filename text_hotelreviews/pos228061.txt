the lovely staff at this divine west end hotel were gracious enough to upgrade my room on arrival the room itself was newly renovated and beautifully decorated and oh so comfortable quiet and warm the location of the hotel couldn t be better right in the centre of theaterland chinatown across the road soho around the corner and piccadilly circus leicester square and trafalgar square all within minutes walking distance for me this is a first choice hotel when visiting the west end of london
