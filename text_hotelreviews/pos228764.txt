spent four nights over the christmas period and loved our stay staff friendly and helpful room was small but we weren t in it for long as we were out sightseeing bed comfy and bathroom a good size didn t try breakfast only five minutes walk from blanche tube station and moulin rouge wine tasting in the evening was nice and we met a lot of different people from around the globe
