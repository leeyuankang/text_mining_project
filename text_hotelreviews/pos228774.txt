the staff were very friendly and helpful i particularly liked that all the hotels in the same chain happy culture offer a happy hour deal between and the r kipling offers wine tasting but we were allowed to benefit from any of the other hotel s happy hour specials during our stay at the r kipling this was a nice treat and the lounge areas in the hotels we did manage to visit during this time were very comfortable and well decorated
