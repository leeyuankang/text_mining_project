we stayed in a sort of chalet behind the pub it was generally quiet though they were doing some drilling during the day it had a good desk to work at and a comfortable bed the pub itself was lovely with a really nice outdoor area it was a warm day when we visited and a good selection of drinks the restaurant was fabulous a really good and interesting range well cooked
