i liked the general atmosphere of the hotel at the heart of saint germain des pres it is a kind of boutique hotel with green spaces inside situated of one of the narrow streets in the area very close to main boulevard plenty of shops and cafe restaurants nearby very professional staff rooms are not big but very comfortable with a modern bathroom breakfast may seem expensive but food is very fresh and good
