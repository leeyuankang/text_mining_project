i booked this hotel very last minute when a flight delay required that i overnight in paris finding a hotel away from the gare du nord train station at a reasonable price on a same day booking was lucky i did not expect the accommodations to be as nice as they were the room was average size for paris and very smartly laid out it was comfortable with everything you would need the staff particularly florian at the front desk were exceptionally helpful and welcoming
