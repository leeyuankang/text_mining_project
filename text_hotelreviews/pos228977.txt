it s an old fashioned hotel that has been modernised with an impressive vestibule made of marble and a beautiful wooden railed stair case but you can take a lift rooms were small but not cramped i was impressed by the cleanliness it was spotless the bed was comfortable and the pillows were good the shower gave lots of hot water the windows opened up when closed you can t hear the road traffic at all the boulevard is quite busy i like the feeling of being in an inner parisien urban area it s multi cultural very mixed but nonetheless a grand boulevard and not far at all from metro and minute walk to rue de poteau if you want foodie stuff and not far from montmartre the men on the front desk were friendly
