the staff members were very friendly and helpful the location was not exactly where i had imagined the impression is that the hotel is in the heart of montmartre not quite it was clean and comfortable for a few nights stay but not a place i would stay for a longer period of time the room was smaller than the pictures show it thought it was a little over priced considering what you get
