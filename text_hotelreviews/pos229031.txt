the hotel may not be in the best area but the hotel was great was and the staff made it even more so all very friendly and helpful if you are planning to spend time in montmatre it is within walking distance but be warned you need to be fit also a short walk from gare du nord and on a direct metro line to the museums eiffel tower etc there was a little mix up with our taxi on the last day but it was rectified and we arrived at the station with plenty of time to check in the breakfast was perfectly adequate would certainly consider staying again the area may be a little rough around the edges but my friend and i enjoyed a walk around the market both at night and in the daytime and found the people very friendly and helpful with directions when we needed them
