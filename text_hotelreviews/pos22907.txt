the room was bright comfortable and cosy i loved the decor and the whole place had a well kept homely feel to it i recently stayed at another hotel that had a rather clinical feel to it this was the opposite the provision of mineral water and a coffee machine was also a nice touch furthermore the staff were happy to let us checkout at instead of so that my partner and i could have a relaxing morning together the continental breakfast was also delicious with options of cereal yoghurt berries nuts seeds bread cheese cold cuts
