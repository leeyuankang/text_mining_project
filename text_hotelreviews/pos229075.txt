this was super affordable and in an ok location when we walked out of the train station it was not what we were expecting its different and we didn t feel safe late at night but once we got to the hotel it all changed the hotel is nice and comfortable during the day the streets are filled i mean filled by street vendors and fake purse sellers the room was a comfortable run on the mill room breakfast was awesome
