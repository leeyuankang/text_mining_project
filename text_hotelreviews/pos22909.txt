quiet location in suburban area but only a shortish flat walk to shops restaurants richmond park minutes walk from the station at mortlake so convenient enough as a cost effective base for london minutes from waterloo less than minutes on regular bus route from richmond proper a nice friendly neighbourhood pub good bar menu and separate a la carte restaurant options
