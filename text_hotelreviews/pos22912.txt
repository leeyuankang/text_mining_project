it was clean and tidy a lovely couple of homemade biscuits were left in the room for us which was a very nice touch you go to the rooms through the pub where your instantly greeted with the log fires roaring away made me feel very happy food was very tasty as i m gluten intolerant and they didn t have any gluten free bread so they were very good and offered to do me anything i wanted for breakfast which was fantastic people very obliging and tentative to our needs
