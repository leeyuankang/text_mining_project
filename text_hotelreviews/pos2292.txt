the room was clean and comfortable with a view over a quiet street lined with trees although space was somewhat limited as other reviewers have mentioned this didn t affect the quality of our stay and we would come back again we had an excellent breakfast freshly squeezed orange juice and real coffee with strength and flavour a good range of food options and friendly service the staff were all polite and helpful and we were very happy with our stay at the hotel
