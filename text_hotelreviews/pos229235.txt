only stayed one night but we were pleased with the facilities and location a bit expensive but typical of london prices the concierge iggy was really helpful and knowledgeable as you d expect from a concierge but he went out of his way to be helpful with recommendations and was always courteous and calm even when we witnessed an impatient lady demanding attention
