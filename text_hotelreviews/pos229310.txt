we wanted to treat ourselves to a lovely weekend away before christmas not to mention we had tickets to go and see harry potter the cursed child at the palace theatre which was our main reason for staying over it was such a great weekend in a great hotel the staff were super friendly and helpful location is fantastic only a few minutes walk from all the main areas and loads of lovely cafe s and pubs down the road i would recommend the irish pub for breakfast
