welcome was friendly and informal it was a little difficult to know where to book in we just wondered around until we found someone to ask this wasn t really a problem room was small but very well appointed and clean decor and small touches such as coffee machine much appreciated evening bar staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs the standard of the bar menu and breakfast was excellent
