we arrived late at night due to delays on the railway and were upgraded to a very fine suite at no extra cost although several reviews commented on street noise we on the floor did not notice any rather we found it blissfully quiet staff were attentive without being officious and everything was spotlessly clean the courtesy umbrella proved very useful thank you when my wife had her own but i had none the location suited us down to the ground short walk to british museum and covent garden easy transport to the south bank unusually for the uk the plumbing worked with proper hot water coming from the proper shower and all drains working properly we could have stayed longer and will come again
