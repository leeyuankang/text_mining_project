i booked a surprise visit to london for my husband s birthday i couldn t have picked a better location and a better hotel very comfortable hotel and very attentive staff unexpectedly we were upgraded to a deluxe room the room we had was extremely comfortable and had everything you could need for a city break and was central to what i had planned
