we stayed here again for a trip to the ballet at the royal opera house which is only a five minute walk away the location of this hotel is brilliant there is a tube stop around the corner so you could stay here for any purpose the rooms have everything you need and are spotlessly clean and comfortable with a c and heating nice deep baths good shower and free toiletries the staff especially at kingsway are without exception lovely and friendly and eager to help i recommend this hotel without reservation
