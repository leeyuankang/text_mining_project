the staff was very accommodating when we got there we realised there was a mix up as we thought we had asked for twin beds in our booking but it was not reflected in their records they took great pains to accommodate our request regardless aside from that the staff were really so friendly and easy going i travel a lot and recognise that it takes a lot of attention to detail to create a relaxed comfortable environment such as the one at the victoria we really enjoyed our time there highly recommend
