this is cozy small hotel the location is very good as it is close to the metro station and it is very easy to navigate in the rue blanche despite the location is close to the mulen rouge and rue de clichy it was quiet safe my room was small but very clean and nicely decorated very nice and pleasant staff ready to solve your small problems in a very polite and agreeable manner big thanks for additional cooler to my room i was staying probably the hottest night this summer and of course old building and old systems are not ready to cope with this heat reception managed me a cooler to the room so i was lucky enough and had good sleep big plus of happyculture chain free of charge coffee and water in the lobby this already hotel of the chain i am staying i like it
