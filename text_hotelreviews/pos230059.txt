on first arrival the reception staff were very helpful and allowed us to access a room early after a very long flight we were very grateful however when we returned after a few days elsewhere the front desk staff were unhelpful about getting any access and a bit officious so message is it depends on who you encounter the building the hotel is in is very beautiful with rooms down narrow winding corridors we had a very nice room both times of decent size and quiet and comfortable but we paid for a deluxe room the location of this hotel is excellent if you want to do the v a museum and natural history museum which is straight up the road
