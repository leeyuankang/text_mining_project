nicely presented and clean staff were friendly breakfast was very good and it was quiet in a good location only minutes walk from gloucester road tube with lots of shops supermarkets and restaurants nearby the air conditioning was a bit s no auto temperature hold but it kept the room at a reasonable temperature considering it was outside room had an iron ironing board and a safe reasonable number of power sockets there are a bunch of hotel movie services at fairly reasonable prices about to rent a film it is like a rabbit warren to find your room but does have a lot more character than many hotels make sure you check the fire escape route as it was not that obvious
