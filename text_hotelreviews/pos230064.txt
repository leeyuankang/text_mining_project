we always have a great time here excellent location and great service management the hotel might be better suited for a bit older kids rather than toddlers we went to patisserie paul every morning just around the corner for the best breakfast croissants and coffee the hotel breakfast is quite good too but not worth the money to be honest bonus they have great fish n chips in the hotel restaurant the cutest area for evening strolls is south kensington a min slow walk or stops with the bus where you can find good restaurants and great ice cream open late when reserving a room ask for a newly refurbished executive room they are great
