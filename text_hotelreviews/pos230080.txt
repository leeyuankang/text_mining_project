the location was exceptional it was half a block away from the tube restaurants coffee shops grocery stores it is on the piccadilly line which takes you directly to heathrow in min for a few pounds the room was well appointed and clean they changed our towels every day which was a bonus because with in our room there s no place to hang up all the towel to get dried
