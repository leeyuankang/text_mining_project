great location and easy to get to from paddington via tube which is minutes from hotel our room was ok very clean tidy and comfortable however as it was on the ground floor we had a frosted glass window with no view which made the room feel a bit claustraphobic in my opinion breakfast was also good if manic but plenty of choice
