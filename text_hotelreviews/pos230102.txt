the bed was extremely comfy breakfast menu was especially tasty with a wide variety of choices the staff was very helpful with maximum efforts to be helpful and efficient we were pleasantly surprised and appreciative of the wine in the ice cold bucket and the complementary rose petal decor and towel swanlike sculpture on the bed along with the lovely welcoming card celebrating our wedding anniversary stay at the hotel as well the complementary box of sweets was a lovely delightful additional touch
