i chose this hotel for the location near metro station hyde park museums etc despite being situated on a very busy road the room was quiet thanks to double glazing i had a single room that was small but comfortable i chose the option without breakfast as there are so many nearby eating places so cannot comment on breakfast or coffee the conceriage really assisted me with urgent photocopying and sending message that was greatly appreciated
