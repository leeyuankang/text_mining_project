their system lets you choose the room you like very limited choice though one room per floor a couple of days in advance so you can check in before you actually arrive my selected room was ready and the notification came before so when i arrived at the hotel around i could pick up the key and enter the room right away which was great check out is also done online so no waiting in the queue i think this works well for a hotel with so many rooms
