i had a single room small by u s standards but nicely appointed and clean my bath was luxurious with a deep tub and rain shower my view was the mews in the rear which was fine for me as i requested a quiet room no traffic back there but thinking even a front room would be fine as street is pretty and not heavily traveled in the evening the concierge helped me plan an overnight trip to devon for a genealogy excursion that was spot on had never traveled by train and this was the way to go all stuff is extremely helpful and pleasant my last morning there a car had been arranged to heathrow also a nice breakfast bag was made for me to have at the airport must say that location and safety was a huge factor n booking with this hotel as i am a single senior woman
