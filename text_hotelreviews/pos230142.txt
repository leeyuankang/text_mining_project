excellent location for royal albert hall could have easily walked but taxis are plentiful and can be picked up right outside the hotel cost for a taxi to and from waterloo was each way bed was extremely comfortable staff were very helpful and welcoming prices for dinner were reasonable breakfast was particularly good great selection and all very fresh would definitely return and would recommend to friends
