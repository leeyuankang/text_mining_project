decor of hotel room off after checking in cosy feel lighting seating areas bar area food was outstanding plenty to choose from staff were helpful welcoming great location considering it was on a busy road as are most hotels it was very quiet inside allowing for a peaceful nights sleep also a nice touch was having complimentary toiletries towels robes slippers even an umbrella to borrow
