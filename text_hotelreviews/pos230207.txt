location of this hotel is excellent as easy walk to hyde park buckingham palace harrods and the museums and nice shops very impressed by the breakfast choice and excellent quality and liked the bar and cocktails staff provide good service and were accommodating when i complained about the room and changed it and offered us complimentary breakfast which then made the stay value for money taking into account its location good size room with potential for improvement liked the toiletries provided in the bathroom and useful room facilities provided although my son complained about no socket for his mobile phone by the bed
