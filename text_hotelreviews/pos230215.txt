the staff was very nice plus the fact that they were flexible and allowed us to have a late check out without any additional fees we also had a problem with the electricity i signaled it to the staff that immediately sent a technician it was very appreciated also on december we asked to have dinner at the hotel however it was completely full we were very surprised as nobody told us upon reservation and neither on check in that it was recommended to book the restaurant finally as i said that we had planned to have dinner there and we were staying at the hotel the restaurant found availability and we could have a great dinner at the hotel thank you
