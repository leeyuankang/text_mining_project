the fact that you changed our hotel to mercer st one day before we were scheduled to arrive despite the fact that we had already paid for the room month s earlier and this cost us for a taxi to the royal albert hall whereas with previously booked radisson we would have been able to walk so not very pleased with the radisson blu company at all and will not be using you again brgds mr richard rawlinson
