good location and room had tea and coffee room was small and had no bedside tables hairdryer was in a drawer with the wire connected so very difficult to use as it only stretched a short way bathroom was clean and had good facilities but both our room and my daughters had a big black ring in the toilets so that let the room down a bit nice big fluffy towels only one small lift which only fitted people and very dark corridors it just seemed a maze of corridors and stairs probably wouldn t stay there again
