what a beautiful jewel of a boutique hotel from the moment we arrived we knew we were staying in a very special place the staff was attentive helpful and made sure we were happy with our room which was bright spacious and a most comfortable king sized bed the rooms are classic and understated with soothing colors the linens towels and soap were of the highest quality i could imagine the vanderbilts gathering around the marble fireplace in the waiting area adjacent to the front desks the charming fresco ceiling enhanced the feeling of a bygone era we were able to take the tube directly from heathrow to gloucestor station which was less than a block from the hotel and very convenient as we used the tube often very centrally located we were able to easily walk to royal albert hall the victoria and albert museum and the hop on hop off buses breakfast is served in a lovely dining room and was generously appointed with many options from a simple continental breakfast to full english breakfast with everything in between like fresh juicy strawberries to several types of yogurt truly this hotel exceeded our expectations we felt very lucky to have discovered it
