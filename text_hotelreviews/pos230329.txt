excellent welcome and support from the front desk including in booking shows etc very good buffet breakfast and a reasonable range of wines and other drinks in the bar outstanding location near the gloucester road tube restaurants and pubs and museums parks our room was a good size comfortable although the shower in the bath in a tight ish bathroom might be a little difficult for some personally i d replace the baths with just showers a little quirky adventure navigating to our room the hotel grew from joining a number of prior apartment buildings but great character
