i stayed in this hotel previously in my single room was so small it felt like a wardrobe so this time i booked a superior single worth the extra room was a good size and nicely furnished it was facing not the road but wasn t at all noisy staff were incredible helpful i didn t dine there so can t offer an opinion on that
