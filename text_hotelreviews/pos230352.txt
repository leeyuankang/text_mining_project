all the staff were extremely helpful and courteous the room was small but the bed was bigger than a single which was more important there was a very good choice for breakfast plenty of fresh fruit as well as the usual hot fare better still it was included in the price trouble free check in and out the location was great for the v and a and the royal albert hall
