i had a standard single last week this time i had a larger single room and was soooo impressed more space somewhere i could work slightly larger bed i was very pleased well worth the few extra pounds i needed to get some work done during the afternoon so being able to check in soon after and then spend the afternoon in the hotel s business centre was a real bonus a colleague joined me for dinner in the hotel s restaurant we had a great meal it wasn t over busy so we could talk without feeling nearby tables were so close they might share in our conversation
