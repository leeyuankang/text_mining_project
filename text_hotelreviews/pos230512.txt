one minutes walk from gloucester road tube station and ideal for royal albert hall hyde park pillows were duck down and amazingly soft and comfortable along with the beds room facilities were excellent with shower gel conditioner shampoo etc of a good quality loved the name of the restaurant part of the hotel scoff and banter the menu was varied as well we ate out for no other reason than my daughter had bought my wife and i a voucher for a local pub called the queens arms recommend this as well breakfast in the hotel was full of choices with continental and full english available as well as fruit etc staff were only to willing to get cooked what you wanted so fried eggs and omelettes were fresh on the sunday of the weekend we stayed feb my wife and i were really impressed with the breakfast waitress as she was like a whirling dervish and was flying around clearing tables getting teas and coffees and special orders nothing was to much trouble and if only i had got her name because she definitely deserves a mention in fact all the staff were so pleasant from check in to housekeeper to the irish restaurant manager ess to check out altogether one off the best hotels i have stayed in whilst visiting london
