we stayed for two nights and the location was spot on for our visit requirements the staff were very friendly and helpful making us feel very welcome our room was very clean and spacious the bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept well the room was well sound proofed even the rush hour traffic during the morning was reduced to a whisper breakfast was very good with a fair selection of hot and cold dishes bar was cosy with a good selection of drinks expect to pay london hotel prices though i would recommend this hotel and will stay here again if we are in this part of london for a visit
