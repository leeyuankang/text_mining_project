stayed two nights hotel very light and airy with very pleasant and helpful receptionists de lux room was very good and well appointed breakfast was a pleasing experience with everything you need hot or cold hotel near kings cross and st pancras minute walk aldo the tube is two minutes away all in all very good only gripe is the price which i know it is london but is still a little steep for two nights ugh
