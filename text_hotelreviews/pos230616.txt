excellent location for royal albert hall history museum and science museum lovely hotel with helpful staff room was spacious and clean although the bathroom was a bit of a squeeze good facilities in the room including tea and coffee fridge and water although a few complimentary biscuits would have been nice for the price i paid food from the bar was also very nice although drinks were a bit pricey
