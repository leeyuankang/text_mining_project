the location of this hotel within easy walking distance of st pancreas and kings cross was a big plus for us the staff are excellent very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble our room was a good size with plenty of space especially for a central london hotel the buffet breakfast is more than adequate and of a reasonable quality with plenty of selection from continental to full english we were only here for one night so we didn t really need or try any of the extra facilities available but if you need a good quality hotel with good transport links to both main line and underground i would recommend the pullman we will definitely stay here again when we next visit london and by the way although our floor room overlooked the busy euston rd it was well soundproofed and we couldn t hear a thing
