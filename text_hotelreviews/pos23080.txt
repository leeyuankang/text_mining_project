less than mile from st pancras kings crossing station so chunnel access great along with piccadilly line to heathrow also immediately next to london british library really a must see for historically significant documents free with museum style dining available only there one night so neighborhood not throughly examined but not what you would term quaint with variety of dinning shops staff great not the cheapest around but very comfortable
