very friendly and helpful staff i especially liked the greeter role which made the customer journey in the hotel effective for london measures the room was quite large with an extra sofa bed for our daughter the food in the restaurant was really good at very good price quality ration we will surely return to pullman on our next visit to london close to st pancras station allowed us to drop off luggage on our first day very easily and continue our trip to the city
