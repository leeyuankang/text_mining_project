guests are welcomed from the moment of arrival by warmly smiling friendly efficient members of staff it was good to be asked for preferences as to room location quiet and with a view were mine the room was spacious and well furnished for comfort with spectacular views northwards to hampstead heath on the skyline full marks for the shower the best ever of the many hotels i ve stayed in in london and elsewhere this scores above the rest in almost every respect
