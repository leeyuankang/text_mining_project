the bed was super comfy we had a glimpse of the eiffel tower over the rooftops from our room everything we asked for we got easy access to an iron and wi fi codes when ever we needed them the room was very very clean and tidy the hotel is also very close to lots of metro stations and we found it incredibly easy to get around and see the sights
