in walking distance of gare du nord the hotel is well located for exploring the montmartre area with metro close by when you want to go further afield don t be put off by the sleezy tone of the area it s safer than it looks and becomes very chic a few steps uphill staff are helpful and friendly and the rooms comfortable complimentary bottled water is a nice idea
