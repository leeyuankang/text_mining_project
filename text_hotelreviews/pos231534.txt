i liked everything about the hotel but the sofa beds werent so comfy and we didnt have an iron in the room although on the website it says all rooms have and iron and ironing table when you ask the room service people to bring something up you meed to ask twice or three times reception staff would ask for deposit but when you check out they wont give the deposit nack until you ask them she also didnt want to return the deposit because she said you had breakfast with person but i didnt she was thinking for another excuse and she said again oh ya you had breakfast more than a limit but nowhere on the hotel webside mention that there is a limit for breakfast
