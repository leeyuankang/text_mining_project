when you stay at the caf royal you will expect first of all a high class hotel service the hotel staff is an enrichment for this five star hotel they are extremly friendly and willing to satisfy every wish from you the room i had was very clean and neat although the caf royal is located on the busy regent street and a stone s throw away from piccadilly circus i didn t hear any noise in the room i can highly recommend a visit to their akasha spa nice pool and a variety of spa treatments if you are looking for a very fine dine seafood restaurant i can recommend scott s restaurant on the mount street i will definitely stay again at the caf royal when i am back in london
