beautiful hotel centrally located the rooms appear to be soundproofed as my gf did well and she is a very very light sleeper everything was as expected in a luxury property you get what you pay for still holds true only disappointment was i did not reserve early enough for tea in oscar wilde room so they could not acomadate our time but my failure to plan is not their issue i would recommend the property highly
