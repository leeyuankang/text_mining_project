the staff are all well mannered except the chauffer that drove us to the airport he was kind of rude when he saw my child left the empty doggie bag in the car he impatiently asked her to remove it when we were leaving the car upon arrival to the airport i supposed he could clean up the little garbage as we had loads of baggages to carry i didn t expect to pay for this kind of service
