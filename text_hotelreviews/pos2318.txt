good location for us quiet street very nice area right near kensington gardens which means u can walk straight through to hyde park and get to harrods ect also walking distance to tubes which was handy and they give u a mobile so u can use to find ur way around london which was very handy it was quite slow and frustrating at times but still a really nice touch that i haven t had before
