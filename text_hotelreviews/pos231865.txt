i liked the size of the room it was pretty big the bed was comfortable the rooms were clean the location was decent just a metro ride to places into paris and the metro is literally right outside so it made location fair should get a visitor pass to make it easier for the trip so you don t literally have to keep paying for the metro every time you take it
