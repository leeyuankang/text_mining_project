i really enjoyed the location as i was participating in a fair at the parc des expositions of porte de versaille i loved my room which was very spacious and comfortable i also appreciated the assistance of both receptionists and the lady who worked in the mezzanine when i had breakfast she was helpful friendly and approachable thank you for this lovely experience
