the hotel was in an ideal location only minutes walk from the high street shops restaurants and both rail and tube stations at victoria all of the hotel staff were helpful and nothing was a problem we asked to borrow an iron ironing board when we checked in and it was delivered as soon as we reached our room the hotel is full of old world charm and we would definitely stay here again
