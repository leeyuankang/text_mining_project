we had people in our party so it was tricky trying to find a room that accommodated adults my tall adult son was thrilled with his own double bed and we had a large queen all the beds left little floor space but we spent very little time in the room location was great it is a hearty walk to big ben or buckingham palace but a minute walk to the underground that will take you anywhere you want to go
