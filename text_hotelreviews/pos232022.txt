could not recommend this hotel higher wonderful service beautiful room i had a personal issue with family illness meaning i had to modify my booking and although it was non adjustable the hotel were very very helpful and adjusted it for me with no problems room was perfect having the windows able to be open was a nice touch loved the marble bathroom every single member of staff was friendly and polite going out of their way to be helpful i would definitely stay here again
