the staff where exceptional polite could not be more helpful the room was very clean and spacious the bed was massive with toiletries tea and coffee facilities the staff squeezed us in for a late sitting in the evening although run out of some starters they quickly apologised and rearranged for us to have something else i can not fault this hotel the location was excellent literally minutes walk from london kings cross and great access to the underground i would definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends and family thank you
