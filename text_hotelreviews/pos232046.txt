very nice quiet location near victoria next to the vincent park knowledgeable and nice staff there was a little problem with my tv late at night and the management agreed with no problem to provide breakfast free of charge for this inconvenience also it was very nice that even that i didn t ask i ve got a free upgrade i booked a one single bed room and got a spacious double beds room with a bathtub it was a treat
