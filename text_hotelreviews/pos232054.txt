kind staff quiet location with windows towards the park two bed room executive was quite large only tried the food once room service was fast and the food excellent the wifi was fast and reliable only logged in once and then stayed connected with all units for the whole time location is good if you want to be close to sightseeing and if you like it more quiet you need to go by bus underground to get close to the areas with restaurants shopping and atmosphere
