we arrived here on a saturday afternoon around unfortunately our room wasn t ready as check in was at but we were able to leave our baggage there which was a god send considering how heavy mine was we arrived back late afternoon early evening and our room was ready it didn t take long to check in as all the staff were courteous n helpful i was impressed with the decor of the hotel as it s very smart with tasteful xmas decorations all around we booked the standard room for a night stay in london it was comfortable and clean the only thing i have to point out is there was only robe in the room i booked a twin room my companion was unconcerned by this as she had alternatives to wear i m sure if i raised it at reception they would have resolved the matter at hand check out was brief n swift with no issues overall a very nice hotel and i would definitely be visiting again on my next trip to london
