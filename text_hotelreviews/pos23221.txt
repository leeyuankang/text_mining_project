check in super smooth after a long flight we reached approximately hours earlier than the check in time and were mentally prepared to just drop in our luggage and hit the roads and come back later to check in but to our pleasant surprise the lady on the reception alexia if i recall properly accorded us the room super quickly as the room was available and waiting for us even though the hotel looked fairly busy but the staff was always smiling the room was fairly modern just as we expected with good size and nice city views and the hotel decor was warm cozy and modern have booked it again for my return leg from new york for nights so am excited and looking forward to our stay location is so cool with euston station just minutes walk on the right and st pancreas station a minute walk to the left with kings cross station a minutes walk further lots of coffee shops restaurants sainsbury store and everything with in the minutes walk radius
