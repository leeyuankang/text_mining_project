very near south kensington tube and hotel just round the corner from natural history museum pleasant reception staff and porter in spite of my niggles it suited me for a one night stay but a bit steep however it is central london and a lot cheaper than places like travelodge and premier inns i would think the double rooms would be good a nice feel about the hotel
