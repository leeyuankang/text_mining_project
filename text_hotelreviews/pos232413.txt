the place was right near a lot of museums and the south kensington underground was just around the corner lara and alex were the most helpful people working there and everyone else seemed very nice too the room was perfect for me it was small and just a place to sleep the food was not too good but there were a ton of restaurants in the area i would definitely stay here again i m a budget traveler
