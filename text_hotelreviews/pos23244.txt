amazing stay particularly like the lounge near the lifts the floor to ceiling view is spectacular everything is well thought breakfast buffet is impressive the stay was actually a birthday surprise for my husband and they did arrange a little surprise for him some macarons with a warm wish from the manager i think emily i m not usually fussed about toiletries but here the toiletries smell so divine it s worth a mention can t recommend this place enough especially for special occasions tips get down to breakfast early the queue can be quite long later in the morning
