you can t beat the location if you get the room on sale value for money is very good you can walk to many of the museums and it is minute walk to the underground station with couple of lines there is a big tv in the room staff was always very friendly breakfast was ok as we have different plugs it was nice that staff was ready and had couple of adapters on hand despite it being cold outside the room was heated very well
