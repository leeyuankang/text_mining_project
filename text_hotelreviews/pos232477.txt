proper english style hotel a little fawlty towers i loved the homeliness and intimacy of it not big branded and brash desk in room to work st wifi great lovely staff felt secure and comfy after a day in the city liked that it had a bath water pumping hot breakfast ample not as cheap as on high street but worth the extra not to leave the building relax short walk to brompton road shops harrods on doorstep of museums
