very good location walkable to museums and subway there s also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby the staffs during the day are super friendly one fixed our room situation the next day and offered free full breakfast for our checkout day which i think was fair given night of of room mix up prices are very good for london we paid about per night i wouldn t say it s but the rooms were clean and had nice toiletries plus little vanity kits i didn t experience any of the dirtiness others have complained about the room for night superior twin was small but nicely decorated victorian and clean beds were short though and i m the superior double room we ended up getting night was actually very modern and not styled like the pictures at all i thought it was pretty but my bf preferred the older style bathroom was very spacious and modern seemed new and there were sockets everywhere including direct usb sockets for just a night i think this is one of the best places to stay obviously better places can be had for more i think people here give bad ratings because they are used to paying this price for better hotels yea in cheaper cities not london would definitely stay here again
