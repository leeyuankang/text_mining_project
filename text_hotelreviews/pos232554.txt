this was to be our last nights in london we chose this hotel based on traveller comments and photos we like staying in kensington area the photos do not resemble the rooms we arrived on one of london s hottest days and expected the air conditioning to be working what we were greeted with was an enormous floor machine with large tubing being fed out a hole in the window it was vastly in efficient and gave little relief from the stuffiness of the room i had booked a double room and was astounded when it turned out that instead of a double bed we had two single beds made up as singles shoved together there was a height difference of around between the two mattresses the bed i slept in had holes in the sheets there was no fridge no grab rails in the bath shower we spoke to zita who advised that we send an email to complain there is only one lift in the hotel which is slow and can only accommodate people at a time despite requests to speak to a manager no one was available till we were walking out the door as a guesture we were offered a refund of one night s accommodation
