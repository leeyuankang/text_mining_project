there were many mixed reviews of this property so with apprehension i booked nights it was a very cheap price for london at this location you can t beat the location directly across the road from the national history museum and only a minute walk to the south kensington tube with an excellent variety of restaurants shops nearby the room was reasonably spacious it overlooked a local school but no noise issues from that free wi fi friendly reception staff i didn t have breakfast in the hotel price location outweighed the bad points for me
