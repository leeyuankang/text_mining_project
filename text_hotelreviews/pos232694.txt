hotel looked fantastic from the outside inside was a warm reception area and staff were lovely even taking the time to speak with my daughter there was a small lift to the upper floors and room was easy to find rooms were a little dated in decor but very regal looking and very clean adequate facilities and the wifi access was explained to me on check in easy access links to tube and over the road from natural history museum
