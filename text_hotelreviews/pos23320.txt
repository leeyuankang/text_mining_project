i stayed here at almost the same time last year and although i didn t get an upgrade to a suite as i had before the experience was still very satisfying the room was spacious and clean and staff were friendly and helpful really appreciated their effort in obtaining down pillows when only one was found in the wardrobe and even after the reception told us that they had run out of supply convenient location good breakfast ample copies of newspapers and magazines all pluses and will think of returning next year
