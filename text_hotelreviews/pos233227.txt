great boutique luxury hotel in a perfect location for folks who like to walk a city my kids are teenagers and were perfectly happy with this hotel but little kids would likely not find much to their liking no kiddie facilities or programs in other words i would recommend this hotel unreservedly to any business or leisure traveler looking for something small and a bit out of the way it s tucked into a cul de sac while still being near to all the good stuff
