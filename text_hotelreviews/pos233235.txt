very close the green park tube station using the secret back door close to piccadilly and lots of shopping food etc very comfortable room junior suite on the first floor felt very homey yet modern enough nice bar cafe onsite and lounge kind of tucked away just off the main cross street made it very quiet and peaceful it you wanted more hustle and bustle just a couple blocks away close to buckingham palace trafalgar square and numerous sites other as well within mile was a post office we used to send home goodies and a tesco market i would definitely stay here again
