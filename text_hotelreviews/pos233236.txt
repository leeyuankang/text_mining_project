breakfast included would have been better and couple of the hooks were actually not available baloney room and the roof top bar was told the roof top bar was private only and that the balcony rooms are only if available the room was fine and we slept well there was however a large machine outside of the bathroom that had a loud industrial sound hours a day was good that the bathroom separated the noise from the sleeping area the location is really good and we did enjoy our stay
