this hotel was by far the best i have ever stayed in london the room was pristine linens gorgeous overall quality star the location can t be beat right off piccadilly without all the noise as its on a private back street the staff were very friendly and super helpful as i arrived in the morning quite early and they were able to accommodate an early check in amazing
