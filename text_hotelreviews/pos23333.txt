the attentiveness of the staff when i had made a special request was really something else i was leaving for months so i asked them to just do a simple request for when i came into the room with my boyfriend instead they called me up and asked me what he liked ended up making delicious brownies for us absolutely amazing what they did for us its quite simply put that the pullman is one of the rare hotels that really cares for its customers
