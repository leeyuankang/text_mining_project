very convenient for shaw theatre and for northern rail stations we had a bedroom at the back and it was very quiet for a central london hotel bed was very comfortable the bathroom was very clean and well appointed but overall the room was a little austere i think the hotel has recently been refurbished because everywhere was very clean and well maintained breakfast at seemed expensive but there was an amazing choice of good quality food so you just had to tuck in to get value for money and you could take time over your meal too the staff were very polite attentive and helpful
