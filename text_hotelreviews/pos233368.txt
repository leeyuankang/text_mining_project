lovely hotel great staff it s not far from moorgate tube station although i arrived early and wasn t expecting my room to be ready i was provided a glass of prosecco while i waited and didn t have to wait more than minutes the bed was v comfy great little wet room and elemis toiletries provided we never heard anyone else so the walls must be pretty thick which meant a great nights sleep important after a day trekking round london
