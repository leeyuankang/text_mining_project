all the staff were really helpful friendly always had a smile especially those at the check in desk we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel would definitely stay again as it s very close to moorgate underground station we stayed over the weekend which meant it was really quiet as it s mostly offices around this area the downside is that shops cafes were mostly shut over the weekend however we did manage to get some that was opened thank you apex london wall
