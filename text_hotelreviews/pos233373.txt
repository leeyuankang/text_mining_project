despite arriving very early our room was ready there was some free treats and the room was all we needed the bath was lovely and big and very relaxing as our feet were tired after walking the streets of london we did not eat at the hotel it did have a bar and restaurant however we wanted to visit fenchurch street which is nearby and has views from the floor over the thames and shard so we had booked a table at this restaurant
