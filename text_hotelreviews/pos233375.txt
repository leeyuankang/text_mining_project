the breakfast was good but rather expensive each for continental after the first morning of our three day stay we simply purchased some bakery goods juice and fruit to make a simple breakfast in our room after getting some under cooked fish and chips with the skin left on the fish in a local pub we also bought some groceries and made ourselves simple sandwiches and salads in the evening for the remainder of our stay
