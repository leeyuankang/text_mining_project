i arrived at the hotel hours before check in time but the lady at the front desk let me check in anyways she was an absolute gem the hotel was very nice and clean and the staff were all kind and courteous the restaurant has pretty good food and the bar service was great the peruvian bartender who i think has since moved on was great and extremely knowledgeable i loved my time at the apex
