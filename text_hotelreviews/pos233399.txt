the shower was excellent like really it was probably one of the best i ve ever had also many complimentary items which were super helpful our check in was after and the receptionist at the time was super nice super helpful and had a great positive attitude which really helped the mood the location was superb also it s relatively quiet at the weekends so you sorta don t feel like you re actually in london until you board the tube would happily stay again
