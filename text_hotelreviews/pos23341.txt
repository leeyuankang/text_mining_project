the staff were excellent my husband was unable to travel at the last minute due to a foot injury the staff pulled out all the stops to make up for me being on my own in the city on what should have been our wedding anniversary celebration they provided me with a room upgrade a glass of bubbly an early check in a beautiful cake to celebrate the occasion a wonderful breakfast cocktail and regular checks to see if i was ok nothing was too much trouble this was an emotional time made better by care and attention to detail check in and check out was straight forward lovely food and great choices for evening meal and breakfast
