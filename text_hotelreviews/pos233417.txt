the staff emailed me before our trip as i had said it was a special treat for my son they enquirer about his name and if it was a special celebration a real personal touch we received a treat for sam my son and an upgraded room which made our trip really special thank you so much xxx the surrounding area was really quiet at the weekend so no traffic noise or disturbance
