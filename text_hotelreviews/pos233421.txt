we had a fantastic time at this hotel can t praise the staff at apex london wall enough guests are made to feel genuinely welcome more like a family run boutique than a hotel chain special praise has to go to megan on reception and carlos on bar they both went above and beyond and seemed to really enjoy their work my husband unbeknown to me had phoned the hotel prior to our arrival arranging for a bottle of wine to be put in our room as it was our wedding anniversary during our stay we were given a complementary upgrade and towels were made into the shape of swans on our bed with rose petals scattered on the bed and round the bath looked amazing we ate in the restaurant on the first night food was delicious and the service once again was first class with it s close proximity to bank moorgate and liverpool st stations i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting london whether for business or leisure loved every minute of our time at this beautiful friendly hotel we will be back
