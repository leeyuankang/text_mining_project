the breakfast was amazing and we weren t rushed although we were unable to get staff to clear and set up our table which had been used we then had mixed results when we requested hot drinks but overall it was a relaxing and satisfying experience also the head receptionist was very savvy and on the ball she was helpful and aware of how she could help us
