so good the staff were excellent with smooth check in by the young lady on reception who was brilliant ensuring we had everything we required as well as providing us with any information she thought we may need a couple of things not working in the room but dealt with promptly and wasn t a problem at all room was great clean and very comfy with a huge bed and beautiful bathroom we did eat at the restaurant as we had a taste card which gives off and the waitress was superb very attentive and friendly and is a credit to the hotel as we are vegans we asked what she would recommend and herself and the chef were very accommodating cooking food not on the menu so everything was meat and dairy free pretty unusal for a hotel restaurant from our experience the meal was very nice well cooked and tasty probably now my hotel of choice in london well done apex london wall
