loved the complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival and the staff couldn t do enough to help excellent service there was a fire at the hotel at and we were outside until but the staff were so helpful handing out water foil blankets slippers and coffee they really did try hard to look after us in the circumstances and offered some money back all in all an excellent stay and my room was fantastic and lovely and quiet for london
