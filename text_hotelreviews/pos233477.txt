bed super comfy toiletries great clean modern and stylish love the free duck great location nice and quiet at the weekend but walking distance to good places spitalfields market museum of london and we had a short taxi journey to brick lane in the evening we were upgraded which was a nice bonus breakfast was delicious we had it in bed as an extra treat to ourselves being able to borrow dvds for free is a really good touch we would definitely stay again
