me and my girlfriend celebrated valentines day here and boy did they take the extra mile not only did they offer champagne but also provided rose petals and swan shaped towels with a handwritten letter and business card from the hotel manager welcoming us staff were so welcoming and fun location is amazing as well as facilities could not recommend this place more to stay
