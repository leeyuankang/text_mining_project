megan at the front desk was amazing swift check in and she was nice enough to bring me and my partner glasses of champagne and a small box of chocolates i went for a bigger sized room as i was skeptical about space but for the two of us the room was humongous and my partner was pleased earnt myself brownie points we didn t stay at the hotel for long as we are a young couple we was out in town and at restaurants but when we did spend time we didn t want to leave very clean rooms irons kettles iron board robes clean sheets everyday and complimentary hot drinks in your room was surprised that the staff are friendly enough even at in the morning to grab me a glass of coke luxury hotel and affordable prices i cannot stress how much megan made our stay as pleasant as possible great ambassador for the brand was even able to push my check out time by an hour for free amazing experience hope it s same again when we return
