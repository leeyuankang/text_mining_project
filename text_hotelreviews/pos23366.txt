the hotel room was extremely cold the a c was the most complex i think i have ever discovered otherwise the hotel was fine clean well equipped shower room all fairly typical of the pullman brand the staff need to be much better trained when dealing with a guest who is deaf its not ok to say thats fine no problem and them to mumble and continue talking to me when looking away i asked the lady at reception three times to speak to me so i could lip read each time i m sorry yeah really i gave up in the end and simply walked to my room no idea what she was trying to tell me
