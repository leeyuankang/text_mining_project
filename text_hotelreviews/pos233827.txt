our british airways flight was cancelled we landed from ny and got stuck in the airport for hours so we booked our stay same day at and got a really good rate excellent location min walk from metro station relaxing and cozy mood complimentary coffee and tea friendly staff we had a very long day ahead the next day so they happily offered us a late checkout overall amazing experience partially alleviated our horrible journey with british airways
