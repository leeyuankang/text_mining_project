it was a nice hotel a bit tucked away if you blinked you d miss the entrance but overall a good london hotel and very well situated for the royal albert hall only a few minutes walk away from it a nice hotel clean rooms and nice staff very friendly the room was very nice we had the junior suite it was well laid out and suited our group of three perfect with a comfy single bed in the alcove section
