location and staff were fantastic the location was absolutely perfect the hotel is right on high street kensington and is minutes walking distance to the hsk tube kensington gardens royal albert music hall etc its a boutique hotel and the rooms are nice modern and clean my room was quiet well equipped and even had a partial view of kensington gardens one caution is that the single standard room is very small and probably not a space you d want to spend a lot of time in the wifi was super fast one of the strongest connections i ve ever had at a hotel one of the best parts of my stay was my interactions with anadit at reception he was professional sharp sweet and funny he did everything possible to make my trip nice i had a business meeting that i was a bit nervous about and he had me laughing so much that when i d left the hotel i d felt great the meeting went very well i plan to stay there again next time i m in london
