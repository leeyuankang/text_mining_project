the location was brilliant convenient for kensington high st and the parks also for the museums and the albert hall the room was air conditioned and clean if slightly basic we were on the fourth floor at the front and it was noisy but not unbearable best advice would be to avoid breakfast which was fairly awful and to find one of the cafe s in the area
