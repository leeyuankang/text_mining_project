the room was nicely decorated a bit bigger than average for paris still very small but space very well organised i used the free wifi which was reliable there were also some premium options available but i was good with the basic wifi location is excellent as there are many nice bars and bistrots nearby it is a very nice neighbourhood and just a short walk from gare du nord there is also a direct bus but i didn t take it
