the best thing about the hotel is the staff very helpful and friendly the manager helped me book a day trip to the champagne region after my online bookings were cancelled twice he set up a more private experience that cost half the price the rooms are extremely comfortable and clean tons of little extra touches the restaurant is great and lively you need a reservation for dinner because popular for guests and locals alike breakfast is delicious nothing feels too cramped like typical paris hotel the lounge is great to meet for a drink or just to sit
