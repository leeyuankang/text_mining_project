the stay and staff were amazing they were so helpful when asking on how to get to places and monuments as well as when we had asked to possibly change the room for one with a bath they changed us straight away and when my girlfriend and i had realised the plug sockets where different from the uk ones the receptionist let us borrow one of theirs the hotel was super fancy too and i know it s nothing important but the free hot chocolate was the best hot chocolate i have ever tasted i loved my stay and would go back tomorrow
