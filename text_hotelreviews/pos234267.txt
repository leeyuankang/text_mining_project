the location was ideal we enjoy walking and walked to most monuments museums from the hotel min walk to metro minutes into the heart of le marais great restaurants galleries and independent shops the hotel design is modern and clean no clutter we stayed in a superior room which was a decent size nice sized bathroom with bath tub no overhead shower though handheld only staff were wonderful this is by far my favourite hotel chain to date we didn t have breakfast because we are late risers so cannot comment on that
