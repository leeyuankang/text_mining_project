location was great it s little bit far from main tour zone but there are many great restaurant and markets around hotel staffs was almost perfect they even help us to reserve restaurant facilities also great everything was in the house and i was surprised by home networking that i can manage home facilities such as lights or speakers by ipad view view was nice to me there s big apartment across rover but it s far enough
