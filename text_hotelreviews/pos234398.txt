london hotels are hit and miss at best and this one is no different it s a converted something else building the conversion has been well done though having a small front entrance on a very busy london street meant arriving at night in the rain by car was very difficult there is no parking the closest parking lot is quite a hike away and very expensive per day the shower was a little narrow but the water pressure was very good
