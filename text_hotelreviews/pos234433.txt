check in was easy we had a triple room which provided plenty of room for us all there is a small kitchen the room with a fridge and a sink and even a microwave although the room was on a busy road it wasn t noisy at all we stayed for nights and domestics were in while we were out leaving fresh towels etc i would not hesitate to book this hotel again
