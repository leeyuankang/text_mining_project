easy check in at the hotel no reception as such but there are staff available to help the rooms are spacious and comfortable with the usual amenities there is also a room on every floor with extra pillows and blankets etc for you to help yourself free coffee in the lounge area and a water machine on every floor too the location was great for exploring walking and easy access to the tube there is a pub next door which was closed at times over the easter weekend this was a bit inconvenient for us but we found others about minutes walk away
