good location at walking distance to metro station monument even better if one is traveling for business as it s close to the business district our room was big enough with a big bed and great sheets pillows one could get purified water on each floor and complementary coffee from the lobby there is also a vending machine at floor with snacks overall the hotel is really good and offers great services
