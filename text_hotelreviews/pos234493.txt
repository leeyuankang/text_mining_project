quick check in which is great when you just want to get bags dropped off and out to explore all that london has to offer the room was clean and even though we had booked a small double room it was more than big enough to suit our needs shower was powerful and lots of warm water the hotel offered free water coffee juice snack bars fruit which is a lovely addition also the water bottles on each floor of the hotel is a welcomed bonus modern hotel in lovely area which is just a short walk minutes to the underground getting you to all places central in just a few stops
