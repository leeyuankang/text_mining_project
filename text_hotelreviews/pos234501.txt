great welcome from staff extremely helpful when needed easy check in out excellent location with close access to tube station and close to the tower tower bridge and other well known attractions the area was free of hustle and bustle on the weekend all cafes and most shops were closed probably because they cater for office workers during the week as this is the financial district
