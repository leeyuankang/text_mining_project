the hotel is well located in the city of london with lots of transport links nearby we arrived into liverpool street station and it was an easy minute walk to the door our room was on the floor and facing the back so we weren t affected by street noise that other reviewers have mentioned the room itself is set up for business people so has lots of gadget connectivity and good wifi
