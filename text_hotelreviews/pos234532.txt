good location in the city short walk from tube and near to tower of london a good variety of food options in the area filtered chilled water was available on all floors and a bean to cup machine in the foyer rooms a little dated and basic but functional enough for an overnight stay hot shower otherwise this is a basic budget hotel with very little in the way of extras
