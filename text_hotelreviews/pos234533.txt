very easy to book in helpful staff a larger than expected room with great facilities very comfortable night the best part was the location very near to the tube with good access to the whole city we will be looking to stay again the close proximity and internal access to the crosse keys was very useful no need to worry about getting good food and drink at very reasonable prices
