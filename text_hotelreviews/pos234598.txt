in deed a comfy bed heating was working and the shower very fast warm as well veeeerrryyyyy nice in comparison to other cities it was still an expensive stay but in reference to other options in london it was probably the best value by far we could have gotten for our money they even provided a facilitating log in onto a food delivery platform so you could pay officially on the hotel bill for it very good idea next time again
