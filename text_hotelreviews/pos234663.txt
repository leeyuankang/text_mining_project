cannot recommend this hotel more booked it as part of a surprise trip for my father s birthday and the staff were fantastic great communication prior to our stay and they happily accommodated a couple of small requests i had they also provided a welcome basket and a bottle of wine i m not sure if this is standard practise or due to the special occasion but it was a nice touch all the same room was lovely large clean and nicely decorated location is excellent for getting around london bank station is a min walk and has great connections to the rest of the city walking distance to london bridge st paul s cathedral and a number of other attractions the immediate area is very quiet over the weekend not many restaurants bars open so you will have to venture a little further afield as it s the business district friday night was very lively with local workers but the area seems to shut down saturday sunday there is a wetherspoons right next door to the hotel which does reasonable food and is open every day overall a fantastic stay i will definitely be back
