i booked a suite for myself and two adult daughters as we were attending a family wedding in the city the suite was very spacious had a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and was really like home away from home for the weekend we stayed it was more than adequate for our needs the hotel is in a great location for anyone who wants to take advantage of city sights and above all it is very good value for money don t be fooled by the small check in desk the hotel provides for all your needs
