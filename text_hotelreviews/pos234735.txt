rooms were a good size quiet and clean complimentary tea and coffee in rooms and at reception also have a pc and printer in reception to print airline tickets and tour tickets etc staff were very friendly could leave bag after checkout then visit some tourist sites and return to pick up bag before leaving for airport close to monument and bank tube stations which meant it was easy to travel around london and get to and from airport its beside tower bridge where you can take a boat trip from and also the tower of london loved our stay and weekend would definitely recommend this hotel it was great
