the hotel was located perfectly by restaurants pubs and some shops was a very short walk away from the tube which we needed to get to the theatre wetherspoons next door if you wanted to grab a bite would definately go back again staff were polite and very helpful and the rooms had everything you needed including a fridge kettle and microwave was a short walk from the river thames and the tower of london also
