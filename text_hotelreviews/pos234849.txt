the location was fantastic three minute walk to the london bridge the globe theatre and the tower brige are also very near i would say for sight seeing it s fantastic there are a lot of monuments in the area if you want to do some shopping it s not so great although there are a couple of shops around the hotel itself is really outdated the room was really dusty when i opened the curtains there was dust when i sat on the bed dust rose up i am not over exaggerating my nose got blocked and i couldn t stop sneezing the whole time i was there the bathroom was outdated too only had a shower and no tub and it would steam up really bad a sauna literally and it took a long time for it to clear up on a positive note they have a lot of free stuff free cans of drinks chocolate and nuts in the lobby free unlimited wifi which doesnt require a password it has a computer suite which has a free printer and a gym i didn t really use any but it was good that they were there oh it had a funny smell to overall it is not the worst however the level cleanliness was disappointing oh i forgot to mention they had a basket of toilet tissues under the bed it may not bother some however it bothers me also it needs major refurbishing it too old hope it helps
