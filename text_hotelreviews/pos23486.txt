the whole experience from the time we arrived until we checked out was fabulous everyone from the doorman to the receptionists were very courteous and helpful they seemed genuinely interested in us and made my teenage niece feel very special on her first trip to london the hotel itself is beautiful and modern but at the same time sumptuous try to take the centre lift as it has a glass wall that faces out onto the street and the view as you are ascending descending is lovely the location is great too minute walk to euston station and to minutes to both st pancares and kings cross stations
