the grange bloom is a very nice hotel very jolly british the staff are lovely and helpful and the food is also very nice if somewhat basic the room was very pleasant and extremely clean with easy access via a lift it was ideal for my work in the british museum as it was so very close the resident spook was wonderfully polite and chose not to haunt my room anyway however there just was not anything really special to make this a great hotel good enough value for central london you could do an awful lot worse as it does have remarkably high standards for inner london just quite bland
