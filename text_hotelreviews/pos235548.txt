the hotel has great character and is very nicely located for exploring there s also a great cafe in the park opposite convenient for the tube it s a good base to get around from it s nicely appointed and to a good standard without excessive formality comfortable room nice big bed very narrow bath though all the usual amenities and although no air conditioning a foot ceiling with a ceiling fan away from main roads so no significant external noise very personable and helpful staff
