the bed was very comfortable indeed perfect mattress great pillows slept like at home and i m quite fussy the toiletries were generous the bathroom was roomy enough and the shower was good the room size was bigger than average for london for the price the location was perfect too the hotel was quiet being on the edge of the british museum there was very little traffic noise
