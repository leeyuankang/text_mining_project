we had a long flight from australia and the reception staff were wonderful about booking us in early i had emailed and asked if it was possible and they were so accommodating as well as giving us over a ground floor room if you are a history archaeology buff as i am this is the hotel for you right next door to the british museum and around the corner from the main entrance the underground station russell square is a short flat walk away
