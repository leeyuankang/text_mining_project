i loved the breakfast we upgraded to an executive room for pounds more per day definitely worth it for access to private breakfast as well as regular breakfast and to chill in the more private area loved the sky lounge great drinks and music at night great view of the city great location close to train station and tower bridge hop on hop off right outside of the door
