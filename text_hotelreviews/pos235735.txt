the room had all the facilities you would want from a hotel i especially liked the computer tv great sound for listening to the radio channels breakfast was great a very good choice of continental or full english my only problem was that we sat in the lobby which wasn t the problem but the cooked food wasn t hot and the plates were cold but we all enjoyed our breakfasts both mornings on our second morning we had a very nice young in training waiter called daniel who was very attentive to our needs we have stayed in quite a few hotels in london over the years and i can honestly say this is one of the better ones by far
