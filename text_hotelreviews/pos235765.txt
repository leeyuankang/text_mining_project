the staff were amazing could not do enough for us and made us feel like royalty which we certainly aren t the only staff i found not so good was the barman in the sky lounge who made me feel a bit like we shouldn t be there that said though everyone else we encountered were wonderful and made this treat for us truly a wonderful experience would definitely choose this hotel or a hotel in the same chain when visiting london again which i am next year with my daughter to come and see hamilton
