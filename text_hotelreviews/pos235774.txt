the breakfast was excellent with a wide range of options the queen room was spacious and would be suitable for a couple or single the sky bar was also superb and had excellent views of tower bridge and other key landmarks see pictures really close to local landmarks and not far from tower hill tube station which has links to all over london great base for business or pleasure really enjoyed my stay i have been before and i would go again without hesitation
