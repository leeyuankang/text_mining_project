i stayed with sister who uses a wheelchair as she has limited mobility we had booked a standard room however when we arrived the check in staff offered us the option of an adapted room at no extra cost we didn t take them up on this offer only because it wasn t necessary the room we had booked was very spacious i was able to manage with the chair and the shower in the room was easily accessible for my sister during our stay we ate at the hotel restaurant as it was only a short distance we didn t take the wheelchair however a member of staff saw that my sister struggled walking and came over and advised that they had a wheelchair we could use if needed the friendliness of the staff and the assistance they provided from check in to check out was brilliant above and beyond any expectations they even took the time to show me the best routes to places on the tube etc that i would manage with the wheelchair
