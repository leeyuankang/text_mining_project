staff were exceptionally welcoming and courteous room was very comfortable and clean hotel was very well placed for our our plans including sight seeing tube station places to eat not withstanding the hotel s own food places and within walking distance of where we wanted to be very little noise storage of luggage even after checking out was handled very well the cookie on arrival was lovely but not good if you are allergic to nuts
