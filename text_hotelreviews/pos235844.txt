welcomed with a warm chocolate cookie the experience was top class i had a great time at this hotel and visited lots locally with lots of history surrounding this property it s in the prime location for exploring the staff at the hotel were willing to assist and always on hand i requested extra pillows and they were in my room in a flash i couldn t have been happier with this property and would rate it highly in all aspects when i checked out they were even then still more than happy to hold my luggage whilst i explored my last day in the city when i returned to collect my luggage there was no problem at all everybody was smiling and happy to assist
