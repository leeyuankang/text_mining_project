lovely staff crisp white sheets on a comfy bed and everything we needed in the bathroom loved the crabtree evelyn toiletries breakfast was very good lots of choice hot cooked food too and no soggy toast in sight delicious croissants and pastries and an excellent bread selection too to top it all the view over london from the sky lounge is fantastic
