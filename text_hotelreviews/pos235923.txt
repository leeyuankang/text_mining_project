lovely hotel great location beside the underground love the warm cookie on arrival as we were hungry breakfast was ok my partner had a fry which he said wasn t great i had the porridge which was terrible but loved the fresh fruit and pastries the bar on level is beautiful with great views but didn t enjoy it as it took us to get a drink and it was not that busy we had to watch the barmen show off for an unnecessarily long period of time while they made cocktails would not go back to the bar again as a result of this
