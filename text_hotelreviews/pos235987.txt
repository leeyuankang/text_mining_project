the customer service at reception was excellent plus we were given two vouchers for a glass of prosecco on the beautiful rooftop sky bar which in fairness we didn t know existed until we arrived this was a lovely surprise the views from up there were amazing we got some fantastic photos with tower bridge in the background i would love to return here
