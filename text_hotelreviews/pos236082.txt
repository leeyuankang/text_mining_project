loved this hotel lovely room great position and fabulous bar with stunning view i ve actually lived in london some time ago so it always feels odd staying in a hotel but i found this a real treat and very much enjoyed having a drink on the roof top it s a little expensive but worth the view rooms are not huge but reasonable size
