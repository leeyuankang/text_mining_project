i loved the overall hotel the area the staff breakfast and the executive lounge the views from certain point in the hotel and the staff were very helpful and friendly and there was a personal touch to check in with a cookie the rooms were clean and the rooms also included a big tv and a mini fridge i enjoyed the heating controls also it was a special surprise for my partner which made a massive change to where we normally stay
