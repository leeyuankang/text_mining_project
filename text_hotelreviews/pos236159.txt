the vestibule lobby and public areas were first rate the staff was excellent and made the experience at the hotel worth the value i paid for the added breakfast and it did not disappoint at lbs per person it wasn t cheap but it was a good value and worth the price i was glad my wife and i got down for breakfast early because the line that had formed by the time we finished our breakfast was very long i was only in london for a day because of problems at heathrow however the location of the hotel is right near the tower bridge and allowed me a chance to salvage something out of a miserable experience by allowing me to take in a few sights in my limited time
