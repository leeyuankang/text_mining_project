the chocolate cookie at checkout was amazing the location is first rate our room was large and well equipped the sky bar was fantastic if a tad overpriced in scotland a glass of wine is never more expensive than a liqueur lovely breakfast but a new toasting machine is required people queuing for toast is not acceptable
