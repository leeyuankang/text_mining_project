we checked in with tania she was really welcoming and very bubbly considering it was quite late at night i don t know how she managed to be so cheerful we were given a quick talk through of the hotel the exec lounge skye lounge etc the free cookies and free complimentary mini bar in the room was a nice touch i have to say overall we enjoyed our stay and we will be back again
