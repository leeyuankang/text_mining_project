i was very happy with the service which was received i told them we was celebrating our year anniversary and they accommodated that with a fantastic welcome into our room with swan shaped towels on the bed and a lovely letter to both of us i always stay in this hotel and love the smell of the body wash and the scent there i would love to have some of this if i can
