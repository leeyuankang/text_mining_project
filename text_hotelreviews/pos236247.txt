the hotel location was ideal for exploring the london tower the shard london bridge and along the embankment and so close to the tube station tower hill the hotel room catered for our needs and much more the breakfast had so much choice also make a point of dining at the simply natural restaurant which is apart of the hotel and explore the sky lounge is was awesome will book again
