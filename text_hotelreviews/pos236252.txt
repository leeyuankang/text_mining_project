management staff and guest services are great probably one of the best i have ever seen and i ve stayed in many star hotels open buffet breakfast was satisfying with several good quality food choices made to order omlets were also a big perk hotel location is very conveniently next to a metro station although many tourist sites are min away the station being right next door is such a big perk
