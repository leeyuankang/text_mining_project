our stay was excellent from the reception to checkout made all the better by very friendly staff our room was much more spacious than we expected a walk in wet room type bathroom with fold down shower seat and grab rails most welcome as my husband is disabled the tv mac was very useful for planning our excursions and finding out local landmarks the in room kettle and tea and coffee was really welcome as was the inclusion of a fridge to keep items cool a nice touch and most appreciated the check in warm chocolate cookie was a surprise and very tasty although i must confess that as it was warm the melted chocolate on my fingers found its way onto the bedspread i m sorry about that breakfast was busy but seated very quickly by smiling helpful staff there was a wide section of fruit and cereal along with full english and toast croissants and rolls this full selection of tea coffee and juice was also available the complimentary magazines and newspapers was an added benefit i don t think i can write anything detrimental about our stay we have weekends away at least once a month a and staying here was one of the nicest and most memorable of the last five years we both had a wonderful relaxing time and i wish to thank all the staff we had contact with for that
