the location near tower bridge was great however when we got to the room we were cold and could not get any heat out of the system in addition we were unable to increase the volume on the tv to a level when we did not have to sit right next to it to hear it however when we raised these issues with the staff they quickly came and adjusted the tv and brought us a heater and that was fine
