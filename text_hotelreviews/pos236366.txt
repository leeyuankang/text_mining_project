service was excellent we discovered shortly after we arrived that my son was allergic to the down in the bedding a call to the front desk resulted in a quick resolution with housekeeping immediately replacing all the bedding the location is excellent as well so close to wonderful sites tourist activities and train and tube stations that made navigating london a fun part of our stay i would stay at this property again with no hesitation
