great location and very attractive hotel and facilities be sure to visit the floor bar with great views over the thames another nice touch is they give you for the bar if you don t use room service they claim this is for the environment but as we all know it actually saves them a fortune on staff and cleaning plus it helps the world as collateral also if they can t sort out a problem you ll get further vouchers for the bars etc my good side says this is a nice way to keep customers happy my cynical side have you spotted i have one it s tragic says it keeps punters on site where they can keep spending lovely money
