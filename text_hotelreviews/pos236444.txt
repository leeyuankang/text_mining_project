great customer service from staff you can leave your cases at the hotel before checking in at so if you arrive early to hotel you can explore london without worrying about carrying cases or bags with you the room was lovely very clean and the bed was comfortable great location near tower of london and tower bridge places to eat drink close by around the corner from tower hill underground station to get to centre of london
