we have stayed in this hotel for a few years now and it just seems to keep getting better if you hit it on a day when its prices are sub i would say you d be hard pressed to find better value in london the rooms are a bit small unless you opt for an upgrade but they are well equipped and quiet the layout of the breakfast area has been significantly improved by someone recently and whoever they are they deserve to be congratulated the staff are always superb especially our old friend abdul on breakfast service who has a smile that would light up any room
