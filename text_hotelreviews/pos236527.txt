good location less than five minutes walking distance from tower hill station nearby pubs quiet area at night gd service however check the location of your room as the room we got is very far from the lift lobby so was a hassle especially when moving luggage tv is using a mac computer zcreen so ome may like it some may not it was simple to operate for us
