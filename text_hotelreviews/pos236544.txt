it can be quite daunting being on your own but the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel has a really nice atmosphere unlike some i have stayed at in london my room was very comfortable and clean check in was very quick and you are presented with a cookie on arrival which is a nice touch the hotel is ideally located for tourist attractions and the main line station and underground is a few moments away next time i have to go up to london i will definitely stay in this hotel again and i have recommended it to my son when he visits london
