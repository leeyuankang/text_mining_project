the public areas of the hotel were beautifully kept really quite breathtaking absolutely loved the fresh cookie on arrival i d had a long journey and that made me smile i was disappointed that i didn t get chance to see the rooftop bar but i m sure it was super special our room was comfortable and clean the fact that the tube station was minutes if not seconds away was wonderful really handy and after a late night at the theatre it was very convenient
