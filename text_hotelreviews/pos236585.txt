the hotel is well equipped the computer air con and fridge in the most basic room on site restaurant and rooftop bar were particular pluses this really added value the location is great and for the price we just thought why travel further to central london when we don t need to we had concerns about noise but there was no such issue whatsoever what really stood out for us was the incredible service from the staff the service from hilton was just exceptional throughout from a request for my partner s birthday before arrival to the warm greeting at check in to the cleaners greeting us in the corridors and even a chance exchange with a chef in the elevator every single person we encountered in the employ of the hotel was so motivated attentive and warm i think this really reflects on the individuals and also the training and priorities of the company we were so impressed and will definitely consider doubletree and hilton for future stays
