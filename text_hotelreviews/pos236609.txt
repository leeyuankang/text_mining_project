friendly reception and a lady at the concierge was extremely helpful in the evening of my check up day she was on high heel but took the effort to bring my luggages down by stairs from floor however there was male staff who was on morning shift at the concierge on my check out day he did not smile and asked me to bring the luggages up to floor well it is probably the norm he could have been more helpful the differences in services created different impressions and experiences thanks
