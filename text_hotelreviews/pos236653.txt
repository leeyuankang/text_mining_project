location stones throw from tower hill and on circle district line great access to tower bridge and the tower of london great choice of food outside with st katerines dock close by sky bar was nice way to round off the night with a beer and cocktail or two check out bodeans near by too us style bbq pit attention at check in manager saw us standing slightly confused in front of a mile wide desk and lots of staff looking very busy redirected us within seconds of arriving noise from staff access rooms service rooms was a little off putting we were room opposite so bound to be activity weekends make the surrounds very quiet which i enjoyed if you want hustle and bustle then a train or two will have you in oxford street in mins defo will be back at a good rate with breakie included and a room closer to the lifts above floor for a good view
