david was lovely he checked us into the hotel and gave us a nice introduction of what to expect during our stay it was in a very good location to where we had dinner booked that night close to tower hill tube station the sky bar was good however perhaps not as high up as some might expect the room was very clean the bed was exceptionally comfortable lots of amenities in the room overall a lovely hotel and a comfortable stay
