we were with parents and the location was key staff were friendly and it was a lovely touch when our waitress in the sky bar asked what we were celebrating and we pointed out it was my parents wedding anniversary and along came four glasses of champagne on the house very nice feel about the hotel tucked away off busy roads quiet location lovely views although only from the sky bar bedrooms were comfortable and bathrooms clean we enjoyed our stay and would stay again
