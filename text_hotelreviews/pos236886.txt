wow i travel to the greater london area and london city since rather frequently over the years i got used to many run down hotels and staff that could not really care any less this was my first time at this hotel it was more of an accident that i placed reservations here i was most pleasantly surprised very kind staff at reception and throughout the entire hotel the bath was the most modern and clean bathroom i have seen in london in ages a shower with a water pressure that was surprise not suppressed to a narrow stream this doubletree is worth any extra travel time before i sacrifice on service and comfort again and stay at a different hotel i ll be back
