i can recommend this hotel friendly staff comfortable beds and a nicer location in a very quiet area lots nice restaurants nearby close to lancaster gate tube station or paddington station where the heathrow express arrives bike hire outside you can ride around hyde park the hop on hop off bus passes nearby which we found a great way to get around the breakfast was exceptionally good
