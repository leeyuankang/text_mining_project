beautiful well arranged room room for desk work relaxing and good view of rooftops from the balcony and room except for the lack of full length mirror and hair dryer with mirror nearby the lobby and breakfast area are also lovely and easy to use welcoming breakfasts were truly delicious and enjoyable
