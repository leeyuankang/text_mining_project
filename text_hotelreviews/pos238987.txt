this hotel was beautiful and the room looked even better in real life than in the photos the room was very nicely appointed and felt luxe for the relatively reasonable price and unbeatable location very short walk to the metro and many restaurants and shops nearby the shower was amazing with very good water pressure and the bed was comfy would gladly stay here again
