the linen was lovely the products were nice the cleaners noticed i didn t use the blanket on the foot of the bed and put it away the staff were very friendly and helpful i didn t eat there so i can t comment on the food however the space was lovely i paid per night and thought it was very good value we love the area and usually stay in the arr when in paris i found it very convenient for walking and easy for the metro stations
