the room was perfect very large for europe bed and pillows very comfortable bathroom pristine and awesome showers nice lobby and sitting areas the location was perfect close to metro gardens and restaurants but on a quiet side street easy walk to river and all attractions we mostly walked everywhere go to le hibou cafe just blocks away for pre dinner drinks great sitting outside lots of good restaurants all around lastly the staff was excellent friendly and helpful we would definitely stay here again we visited most of the arrondissements and felt that this location was the best area to stay we did not eat breakfast at the hotel so can t comment on that we stayed nights
