we had the most marvelous stay at hotel baume it was impeccably decorated and had a wonderful old world classy sophisticated yet homey feel the staff was very friendly and helpful the bed was very comfortable and we slept peacefully the entire night through location in relation to the sites was perfect and the metro at odeon was easy to use and only a couple of minutes away by foot we had one night in paris and this beautiful hotel provided us with some wonderful memories we will definitely be returning to this hotel on our next parisian adventure
