this is my fourth stay at hotel west end over the last seven years i booked the superior room for five nights i expected to receive a room with a small balcony as i always have but instead i was offered a room on the first floor without a balcony after discussion i switched to a room on the sixth floor the top floor without balcony but lovely quiet and charming i was able to sleep with the windows open because there was so little street noise everything about the room was comfortable including the bed linens and spacious bathroom with combination tub shower the hotel offers hermes products as bath amenities the breakfast is ample and delicious i was very pleased that the hotel offered non dairy milk for those of us who are vegan this was the first time i experienced this in my two weeks in france another great stay in this fabulous hotel
