i chose this hotel as i wanted the glamour of the hotel plaza athenee but couldn t afford the a night they were asking after going into the plaza during our stay i have to say this is an excellent alternative i would probably choose it over the plaza after my experience this weekend the location is excellent for a visit to pairs we were able to walk to the champs elyesse very easily and the eifel tower is a stone through away it has excellent transport links to other areas of paris while the plaza asks for hundreds of pounds a night for a view of the tower we got ours for less than half of that for for two nights the photo attached is the view from our room on the floor mind you i had to lean a little awkwardly out the window to get it what i liked about this hotel was the friendly and intimate feel much unlike the plaza which felt like a place you d go to be seen the lobby and reception were well decorated and the staff are warm and accommodating they have an honesty system in the front room for drinks which was a nice touch around the corner at the plaza they are asking for a bottle of bud the rooms while small are comfortable and the is minimal noise at night time despite the central location the breakfast was included which was an unexpected surprise they will deliver the continental breakfast to your room for free if you pre order the night before all in all i was very glad i chose this hotel and felt that it was good value for money i would definitely choose this hotel again
