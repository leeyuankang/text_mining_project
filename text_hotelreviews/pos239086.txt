the view is just spectacular from the top floor the rooms are all a bit small but that is typical of parisian spaces petit but made up for it with the rich decor breakfast is always a treat don t expect big american breakfasts this is france so croissants and other delectable pastries are the order of the day the staff are polite and extremely helpful
