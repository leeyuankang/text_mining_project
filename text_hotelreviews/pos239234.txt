from the perspective of location this hotel is perfect just off the champs de elyse and a short walk to the metro george v you have ease of access to the city and all the must sees from the moment of arrival this quintessential parisian boutique hotel was everything one would wish for expect and be pleasantly surprised from all staff knowing our names and engaging us in respect of where we lived the doorman was interested in talking about our local football team to the wonderful attention to detail from roses petals on the bed and a daily rose this establishment ticks all the boxes upon entry into the foyer you are immediately aware you are somewhere special and each and every experience from there does not disappoint the hotel bar is simply elegant and a beautiful escape from the ever busy city streets our room was just divine an elegant balance of parisian history in what obviously is a century building with modern conveniences the bed was extraordinarily comfortable the bathroom large for a city hotel and the space in the apartment itself ensured we were not falling over each other the antique period furniture provided a beautiful ambience the touch of handing your room key every time you leave to reception is a touch from a bygone era and its value is realised when they hand it to you as you walk through reception knowing who you are and your room number without you asking with the warmest of greetings and query as to whether they can do anything extra for you location to restaurants and caf s both on the champs de elyse and rue de berri provides great choice you will be left with lasting memories and a feeling of loss when you leave this truly was one of those hotels that added to the experience of paris in the most positive of ways and we cannot recommend this establishment without a higher regard
