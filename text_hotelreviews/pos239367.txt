not particularly welcoming when we arrived traveling internationally on a night flight you arrive late morning in the hotel and of course can t check in until late afternoon it would be nice to have a cheerful welcome when you arrive there lounge area is not very comfortable and several guests were waiting for their rooms and sleeping in the lobby area sitting on uncomfortable dark space they did have coffee available in the back but no one actually pointed that out to us i fortunately was not one of the people sleeping and walked the neighborhood but should have walked in the opposite direction because one area is much better than the other very close to one of the train stations but unfortunately not the train station we had to go to the next day and the taxi was very pricey due to the distance and the usual paris traffic room and bathroom were very clean but also very small but the price was right
