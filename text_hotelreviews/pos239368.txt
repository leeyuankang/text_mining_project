the staff were very good and mostly spoke excellent understandable english the room was garret style but french charming with a view on the surrounding chimneys otherwise pokey but comfortable and clean the district arr near gare du nord was a bit impoverished and with a mix of cultures but seemed quite safe although we were there on a public holiday
