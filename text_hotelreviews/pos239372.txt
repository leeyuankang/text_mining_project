we pre booked a single night at hotel mademoiselle as an extension of our visit because the original location didn t have that night however the original didn t work out so we also booked the other nights at the last minute actually on the way to the hotel from the moment we booked to the time we left the staff was not only always available to accommodate but offered solutions and suggestions for example since we booked at last minute we would have had to move twice during our stay because there wasn t a single room for the entire time they shifted other reservations without inconvenience to other guests had us wait a couple extra hours to check in and gave us one room for the entire time they also offered complimentary coffee and snacks while we waited since this was our first visit to paris we had many questions and requests every staff member from the front desk to housekeeping was pleasant patient and always helpful sandra front end worked out the room and gave us suggestions for food galleries and markets celina also front end was very pleasant attentive informative and helpful we aren t exactly sure what anthony s title is because he was always assisting us with so many different things he made sure that we were always attended to and lacked for nothing antoine worked the front end at night along with laura helped us through a wi fi issue and offered suggestions for restaurants in the area accurate by the way last but not least gamini served and assisted us for our breakfasts his recommendations were spot on when we return to paris we intend to stay here again well worth it and conveniently located near the train stations
