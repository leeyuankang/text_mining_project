everything was just right location wise was one of the best staff were professional and always has their smile on and gave the required help when asked the room was clean and comfy spa was outstanding i believe the only issue that should be looked after is the wifi connection which was poor speed wise staff and management recommended great restaurants you will get everything you are looking for around the hotel starting from a supermarket ending with luxury cafes and restaurants
