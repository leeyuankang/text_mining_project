the staff were super friendly and the location was perfect for our quick one night visit to paris travelling in and out on the eurostar a very short walk from gare du nord and in fact walking distance from everywhere we didn t use the metro once the hotel upgraded our room and it was simple spacious and lovely the hotel has a pretty courtyard for drinks i would recommend this hotel highly for a quick stop over in this beautiful city
