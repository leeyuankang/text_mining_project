the hotel was conveniently situated for access to gare du nord railway station being less than minutes walk away but on a quiet side street admittedly our room was not overlooking the road the room was small clean with coffee making facilities in the room the en suite was clean with a good shower the staff were friendly and the breakfast choice was good if you are a coeliac there is a reasonable choice of food but do not order the bread as it is thick with a hard crust and muffin pikelet like consistency centre do not be put off by the outside of the hotel as you approach it it is far better than it looks i will use it again on my next visit to paris
