i used to go clubbing at les bains back when it was only a club and one of the trendiest in paris so i was super excited to explore the new design and vip feeling of staying there the location cannot be beat if you like walking around old and trendy paris staff was nice and responsive the clear disappointement for me was the size of the classic room and the price i paid for it the room was so small that my partner and i could not get around the hallway at the same time i constantly knocked my knees when going to the toilet which was in the middle of the bathroom also you ll need earplugs if you re staying on a weekend as the room overlooks the courtyard where people drink and music plays just didn t feel the price was justified but it was a good once in a time experience
