in a quiet street within walking distance of the eiffel tower we really enjoyed exploring a new area of paris for us and staying at this welcoming boutique hotel we loved the residential feel to the area local food shops and smaller resturants we walked along the seine and through parks and back streets we have only seen from a tour bus in the past the room was small but comfortable and well equipped and staff were helpful and attentive we will definitely use the hotel again
