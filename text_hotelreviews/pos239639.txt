we just loved this hotel the room was beautifully decorated beds were comfortable and very clean and airy the staff was excellent so friendly and helpful going above and beyond what we needed the location was perfect about a block walk from the eiffel tower and around the corner were very nice cafes a pharmacy grocery store but it was tucked on a quiet little side street
