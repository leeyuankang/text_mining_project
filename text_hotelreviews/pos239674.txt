the hotel was fantastic we arrived the evening before the horrific events last friday and after the attack we were extremely grateful to learn the owner had decided to stay the night to ensure the safety of all the guests even without that unfortunate circumstance the staff and facilities are quite amazing service was that of a luxury or five star resort we will definitely return
