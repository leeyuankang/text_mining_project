we were going to the hyde park british summer time festival so this hotel was in a good location and very close to tube station staff were very polite and helpful on our first day we were up and out too early for breakfast so the hotel did provide us with a take away breakfast which was good enough and on the sunday we had breakfast in the hotel it was lovely good variety
