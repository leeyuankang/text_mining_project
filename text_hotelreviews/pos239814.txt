hotel is in an excellent location if you want to stay in the champs elysees area close to a couple of train stops room was small but had been renovated had to put one suitcase on the desk to be able to move around the room bathroom was updated and had a nice assortment of toiletries breakfast buffet was excellent and offered a good variety of items the staff were very friendly and accommodating had an issue on the first night with the air conditioning and michel came to our room to investigate and apologized for the inconvenience and indicated we would have to wait until the next morning to address since there were no maintenance staff on site at the time location is on a small side street about blocks from the champs elysees would not have a problem recommending this hotel
