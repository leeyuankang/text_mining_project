the location was superb very close in walking distance to everything you need to do metro is close by as well champs elysee is two small blocks away you get the perks of being right at the city center without having to pay the price of the four seasons the staff was very friendly as well the rooms were a perfect size nice decor and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was a pretty big size for a bathroom in europe and the decor was perfect not too old not too new we would definitely stay here again and reccommend to others
