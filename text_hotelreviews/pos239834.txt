the location is really good just a couple of streets back from the champs elysees just a couple of minutes walk the building is beautiful with extremely elegant decor filled with antiques and paintings it looked very freshly decorated the bedroom colour scheme was very stylish and quite modern with a small but beautiful ensuite bathroom the staff were very friendly and helpful without being intrusive we loved it we will definitely go back
