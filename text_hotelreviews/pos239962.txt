if i could give out of for location i would montmartre is a must see area for anyone visiting paris and the hotel montmartre mon amour made our stay extra special the staff go out of their way to attend to you the service is most excellent and while this is definitely a love themed hotel it was just the right level of cheesiness to be fun highly recommend
