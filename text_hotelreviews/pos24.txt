lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by walk or the tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a mins walk to the hotel all in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning
