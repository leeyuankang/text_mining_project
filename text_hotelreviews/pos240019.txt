from check in to check out the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the madame that prepared our eggs and tended to us during breakfast has to be a proper chef as our eggs were amazing breakfast was very good and the hotel was clean comfortable and quite my husband and i were in paris to attend a short course at le cordon bleu and the location was perfect for easy access to the cooking school and all other popular sites while still allowing for a break from the hustle and bustle in a pretty quiet neighbourhood there was quite enough in walking distance and it was very easy to access public transport to venture further out i would definitely return to this hotel and this arrondissment i absolutely enjoyed my time there i thoroughly enjoyed taking a short stroll and finding myself just behind the arc and in proximity to the high end shops i would recommend the nearby artisan burger eatery for something a bit different and a sit down at the nearby cafe on the corner for a little people watching and a light bite sorry i don t remember the name but you can t miss the cafe en route to from the closest metro stop ternes there s much around the stop also and it s a short min walk overall it s a lovely area and great location for staying in the city
