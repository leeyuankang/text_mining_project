the location of the hotel is very good it s on champs elysees whisch is just a few minutes walk to the arc de triomphe there are also restaurants bar near to the hotel though we just spent our dinner at pizzahut because that s the best pizza for me though we came from italy lol there s an italian pizza resto in front of the hotel too another thing the rooms are clean and i love how comfortable the bed is for those who will depart from the beauvais airport i recommend you to take the taxi from the hotel it will cost you i think for two people and will take you for about ride
