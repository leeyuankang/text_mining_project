we had a terrible journey getting to the hotel the check in was efficient and the receptionist having asked about our journey upgraded us to a suite this said whilst the hotel is ideally situated if you are going to the excel centre it is well off the beaten track for other parts of london other than the hotel there are very few places to eat in the neighbourhood
