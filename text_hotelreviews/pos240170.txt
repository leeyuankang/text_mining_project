this hotel is ideal for visitors to the excel arena it is situated at the western door and down a flight of steps the rooms are modern and comfortable the breakfast is good and the staff are friendly and helpful i walked to and from london city airport to the hotel in about twenty minutes each way there is a footbridge alongside the hotel and then a pleasant walk past barrier park worth a visit if you have time there is a local shop across the way and a small tesco nearby great for a few things and a small bottle of wine for an evening meal i was busy and didn t know when i would get to eat all in all a good hotel choice
