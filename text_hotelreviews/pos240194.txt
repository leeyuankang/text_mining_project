ease of getting to the hotel as it being only minutes from guys hospital it s far cheaper to stay outside london and travel in when needed the bed is the comfiest bed i ve even slept in best night sleep in years staff are always very welcoming very polite and professional and will help you with anything you need value for money is exceptional and i d highly recommend booking an executive suite with queen bed as the rooms are very spacious and even comes with a coffee machine and mini fridge parking is on site and can only be accessed via a barrier so is very safe also and costs as little as overnight well worth it
