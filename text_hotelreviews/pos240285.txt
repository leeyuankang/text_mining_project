the location was excellent for us as we were attending an event at excell literally across the square from the hotel so a very short walk at the start and end of the day the whole area was great close to train for going into central london the cable car to go across to the really attractive docks and lots of restaurants bars in the area and a couple of convenience stores parking at hotel was excellent and good value for our stay hotel was attractively designed comfy bed and lovely breakfast took us a while to realise that the glass wall from the bedroom to the shower room and toilet could be frosted over by pressing a button we really enjoyed our stay and would definately stay again
