location for exhibition excel minutes walk some restaurants are available for eating emirates cable lift is nearby for good viewing of the river and surrounding areas the hotel is quite but needs to be cleaned regularly as carpets and sofas attract dust and pollen the over all experience is very good i recommend to others for staying there if you have a family of kids
