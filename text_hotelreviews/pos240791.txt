the room was comfortable very modern well equipped with every necessity and a few luxuries the bathroom was excellent the best shower i have ever used breakfast was delicious the scrambled egg was perfectly cooked and the croissants were flaky staff were very helpful no view but didn t expect one we stayed in the hotel as a central base for a meal on the south bank will definitely come back
