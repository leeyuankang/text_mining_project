staff were very helpful and couldn t do more for us my wife is disabled and they made sure they were there with the perfect accessible room the food is outstanding and well priced for what you receive the location is great for bus taxi and only minutes slow walk to the tube minutes from the city centre made for a great place to stay i would recommend this hotel to everyone don t judge the inside by the fairly bland outside it doesn t do it justice the inside is plush with plenty of comfy seating with a relaxed ambiance and great attentive staff the room was perfect and so large with accessible services throughout the only thing i might pick up on was the coffee pods weren t replenished during our stay but this is such a minor thing i would stay again in a heart beat thank you to all staff
