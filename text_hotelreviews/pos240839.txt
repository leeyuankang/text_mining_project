location was perfect a walk to borough market is in between two the underground stop can walk to any where central too if you fancy it the staff were brilliant we showed up at to see if we could check in early we couldn t but they were more than happy to hold our bags for us which was all we really wanted tried the restaurant one night the food was brilliant defiantly a must if you have had a long day sightseeing and need a good meal close by have stayed in other hotels in the same area this was easily the best value for money
