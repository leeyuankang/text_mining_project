the location was ideal for our planned trip to the globe and south bank and borough market the mercure hotel had all the facilities we are used to from this brand and the superior privilege room was bigger than other london hotels we have used in the past the bed and shower were excellent the service was very good throughout the hotel and all our requests were dealt with very efficiently the buffet breakfast was good though the retro toasters took ages to heat
