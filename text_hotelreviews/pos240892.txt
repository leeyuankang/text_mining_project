we have stayed at this hotel many times the location is great the staff are generally good the facilities are now looking tired and part of the hotel was under repair renovation our in laws another couple on my booking had no hot water and an odd bathroom door layout the hot water was fixed later in the day bit more focus on overall presentation required going forward
