we stayed at the hotel for two nights and i cannot fault it from the moment we arrived to the minute we left we was able to have an early check in at and they kept our luggage for us on checking out until so we didn t have to carry it around with us the rooms where excellent nespresso machine and tea facilities the shower was a dream very powerful we also paid for the breakfast which i would defiantly recommend the location was excellent a few minutes walk from the tube and just around the corner from the heart of borough market the pubs where great especially on the night on the way back from the tube
