the location was quiet although very good for rail connections london bridge and blackfriars and for bus journeys into the city service in the hotel was excellent and despite the fact that building works were in progress the hotel was spotlessly clean our room was spacious and very comfortable with bath robes slippers and unusually free cold drinks when we asked for extra tea bags and milk they arrived within minutes we would not hesitate in staying there again
