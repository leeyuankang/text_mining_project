the hotel was very modern and the staff at the reception were very friendly the location was perfect as we were eating at the shard that night the room wasn t massive but was perfect for us even thought we didn t use it i liked the fact there was a coffee machine available all in all good shout for what we paid especially the location also didn t need to pay for parking as we found some free spaces round the corner
