great location for all the main attractions didn t book breakfast as so near to borough market which shouldn t be missed bedroom was a little small but that did not compromise comfort or style staff were very helpful certainly service with a smile and as an added bonus our bags were looked after on the day of departure so we could continue to enjoy the sites
