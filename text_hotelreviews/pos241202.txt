room was beautiful quirky comfortable staff could not have been more friendly and helpful throughout our stay superb location with lots of bars and places to eat a few steps away the bastille a short walk down the road and around the corner and very well connected to metro routes to other parts of paris such a breeze to get about blackout curtains in the room were great and the lighting fixtures e g tiny lights inbedded into the bathroom walls were particularly snazzy
