the staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly they let me leave my luggage and when i checked in early they had even already brought my bag up to my room lovely toiletry products beautiful room water bottles included along with a kettle i bring my own tea wherever i go so this was great and i particularly liked the decor and the tiny lights in the bathroom even the elevator music and graffiti inside was impressive cute boutique hotel and i would love to stay here again on my next trip to paris very pleased overall
