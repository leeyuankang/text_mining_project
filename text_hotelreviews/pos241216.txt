is it a very convenient hotel with small but cosy rooms the room is full of details with little lights everywhere especially the bathroom is amazing with a great rain shower and tiny little light between the tiles which creatures a very nice atmosphere the bed is very big and comfortable the hotel is a minute walk away from bastille but the neighbourhood is full of people and very safe also at night
