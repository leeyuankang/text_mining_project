we only stayed in the apartment for one night however it was a great stay the hotel is in an ideal location walkable from gare du lyon and a short taxi ride from gare du nord the staff were really friendly and helpful the room was luxurious small but cosy and the bed was really comfortable the shower was brilliant and the whole room was spotless
