the location of the hotel bastille was perfect not far from the center and quite lively with plenty restaurants and bars quite close without being too noisy or touristic the hotel felt quite new and very well taken care of everything was clean and the room despite being on the small side was very comfortable and with a lovely modern decoration breakfast was not included so we just went to the wonderful boulangerie by the corner to get some delicious pastries and take away coffee we went back there on the last day s afternoon to bring back home some stock
