excellent service from all staff i did not use the cafe so i cannot comment on the food although the rooms are not huge overall they were comfortable i would certainly recommend to friends and stay there again should i visit paris in terms of transport it is just mins from two metro stations which offer different lines there were loads of bar cafe and restaurants in the area
