i liked the location it s close to the subway that i need to move around in the evening when traffic jam is high even though it closes from to in the morning the hotel location is also convenient because it s not too far from the air france bus stop the hotel itself was nice and clean the room was well decorated i loved the lightening design and definitely the shower which had small led lights that would look like a sky full of stars that s very nice
