the hotel had a stunning courtyard at the front overlooking a beautiful square the hotel was less than minute walk from victoria tube station and mins from the coach station my year old daughter was having a tough time with internet trolls and they upgraded our room to a huge room with two king sized beds and the staff amazing it was perfect for us being based so centrally getting to piccadilly and leicester square so easily we also had a long lie in in really comfy beds will definitely stay here again thank you so much for making our weekend special
