from check in to the time i left i was impressed with this hotel the front desk staff was friendly cordial and professional they kept my bag after check out for most of the day so i could explore the town some more the rooms were super clean all the furnishings were new and high tech good tea facilities bed firm but comfy and the room was a decent size for london double windows and blackout curtains insured a quiet comfortable sleeping environment the location was nice ten minute walk from victoria station fifteen to the tate britain and the waterfront and less than half an hour to most of the major westminster side attractions it was also on a quiet private park so off the hustle and tourist bustle of other close to victoria stations overall a good value and a nice place to stay can t really fault it for anything
