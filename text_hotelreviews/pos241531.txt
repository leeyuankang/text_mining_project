very glad to have chosen the grange wellington it s a little walk away from victoria station but it means it enjoys a quieter area and looks out onto a lovely little park the building itself is elegant and stately and the interiors were subdued yet stylish we were given a twin room rather than the double which we were expecting but it wasn t really a problem so we didn t bother asking for a change the staff were polite friendly and welcoming and our room had everything we were looking for we will definitely be staying with grange hotels again
