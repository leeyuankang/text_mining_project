the hotel has been refurbished in the last couple of years and everything is very nice the rooms are air conditioned spacious and well equipped rooms at the back overlooking the street can get some traffic noise but it is not excessive rooms at the front overlook the park and are very quiet the staff are are all very professional but also very helpful and friendly after visiting the dining breakfast room once the next time you come for a meal they remember your name and room number on leaving they checked that i had remembered to collect my medication from their fridge small personal touches like that are appreciated as it is not easy to remember individual things about each guest i had a meal in the dining room one evening and all three courses were delicious breakfasts also had good variety the hotel is well located being in a quiet area but a comfortable walk from victoria in one direction and the houses of parliament westminster abbey area in the other direction and with easy access to bus routes along several main roads i enjoyed my stay at the grange wellington and would definitely stay there again if in london
