the staff was outstanding and friendly they were helpful with tours directions reservations and were sincere wanting to help us paul our bar tender was amusing the room was spacious up to date and it was equipped with a microwave and refrigerator paris is very expensive so i highly recommend families booking the jr suite so they can use the refrigerator and microwave to cut down on food costs there was a market not far the metro was right at the hotel so getting around was easy i didn t think the neighborhood had a lot to offer as a walk we didn t most attraction were away from the hotel but it made it nice and quiet for our needs the patio was beautiful and perfect for a nightcap i would recommend this hotel for comfort staff and access to metro we would come back thank you for a nice stay
