positive the staff were very friendly negative breakfast buffet for and for a star hotel was very very poor even the breakfast room was not a pleasant area my room had a window to the yard where the restaurant guest were sitting so although i was on floor i could hear people talking and laughing there inside the room the refrigerator was the biggest noise generator i even tried to unplug it but no chance being in paris on business for only one day and not being able to sleep properly is not really eficient
