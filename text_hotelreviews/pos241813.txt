located a few hundred meters from a metro with surrounded by lots of lovely restaurants bars supermarkets pharmacies newsagents etc very easy to get to and from the centre of paris without much effort the local restaurants bars are much more reasonably priced than the centre too if you have the time and the weather is good i d recommend a picnic along the seine waving at the passing boats the atmosphere is just magical
