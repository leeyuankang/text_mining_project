the hotel s location is perfect in my opinion it is a walking distance from a few tourist sights but a bit off the beaten path so that the cafes and restaurants are not of the tourist trap variety the metro is very close and getting around is easy the hotel is pleasant to the eye and the inner yard is absolutely charming the staff are very friendly and helpful the condition of the hotel overall is good but not perfectly new there were small things that needed minor improvement such as the lack of sugar and kitchen utensils in the room we were upgtaded to a suite and had a kitchenette
