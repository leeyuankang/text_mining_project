the location in the marais was new to us and was excellent with easy access to public transport the staff were friendly and helpful at all times the room was quiet with a view over the courtyard not overlooking the street was a bonus we also welcomed having a kettle fridge and a sink and had we needed it the hob we would certainly stay again we got a very good rate by booking early
