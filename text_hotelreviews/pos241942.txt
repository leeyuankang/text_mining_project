the hotel is placed excellently as it is surrounded by tube stations on different lines and is easily in walking distance of the british museum and not far from leicester square either if you don t mind a stroll we even walked to king s cross station from the hotel the staff were really helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage in reception the day we arrived whilst we went exploring the city and offered to hold our luggage on the day we left as well breakfast was pleasant and the staff were happy to assist our room was situated at the back of the property and so there was little noise considering the road the hotel is on overall a pleasant stay and i would recommend it to others who are going to london and want a central but budget friendly hotel
