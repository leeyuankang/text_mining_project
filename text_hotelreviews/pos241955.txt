i couldn t find a better location at that price i had the cabin the smallest room i could find and i loved it i didn t need anything more i wish all the hotels had that option the breakfast was ok although i would have liked porridge and they didn t have any the staff was very friendly and helpful i already knew they didn t have a lift so i was prepared with the kind of luggage to carry with me
