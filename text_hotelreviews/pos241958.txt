it was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore british museum british library university of london and very walkable to areas around the double room was small but comfortable for one person it could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily the reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful i would stay there again
