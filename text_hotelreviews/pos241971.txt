i was in a cabin room small but had everything i needed couldn t believe how quiet it was at the back overlooking a bit wild garden quiet within the hotel too didn t hear anyone getting up ridiculously early which seems to be my experience in the big chain hotels i had paid for a night in central london including free wifi and decent fresh breakfast fabulous value
