the location of this property is great it s convenient to st pancras station the british library the british museum and many other delights of bloomsbury for a short stay in which you plan to be out sightseeing all day and evening and only need a place to sleep at night the hotel cavendish would be a good base one advantage it has over some of the other gower street hotels is that the windows are double paned so that the street noise was reduced there was also a fan in the room which was useful because the room was very close and stuffy the wireless was speedier and more reliable than some other budget hotels i ve stayed in there was very little noise audible through the walls which was a relief as this is sometimes a problem in these older hotels
