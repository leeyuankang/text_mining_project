please make yourself a favor and avoid the photos on booking com has nothing to do with this hotel old building v small rooms shower not working properly phone in the room not working it was hot in london those days and you could not open the windows very noisy street and rooms are not isolated the tv is old as well on top of that it is not cheap i booked this hotel in a rush and it was a big mistake never again i believe a lot of hotels in london should be reported they are advertised as or stars and they do not deserve even a star
