nothing the hotel was awful and not what was advertised the family room was tiny and disgusting damp patches and paint peeling off walls and ceiling the furniture was falling apart and all marked as for the bathroom well it badly needed upgrading i would seriously look at your rating for this hotel because in our opinion a is being generous
