staff were pleasant and helpful we arrived early so left our bags for the day before returning to check in on day of departure we kept our bags at reception after check out whilst sight seeing again returning later in the evening to collect that was not a problem so was very appreciated room was clean tidy for adult and children it was small but it was adequate for our night stay i would say it would have been better for just a single or couple though breakfast was nice just the basics the girls working were friendly and attentive to guests coming into the b fast room
