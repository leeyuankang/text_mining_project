a pleasant and comfortable room even though it was in the basement and on the noisy road side convenient to be right next to the breakfast room the staff at reception and for the two breakfasts we had in the hotel were friendly and obliging the best thing about this hotel was its location walking distance from british museum london university buildings and tube stations with an excellent branch of waterstones just across the road
