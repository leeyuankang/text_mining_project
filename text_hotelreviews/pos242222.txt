when we first got there we were put in a room facing the street when i had requested a garden facing room and the bed was not a double just a bit larger than a twin and the window wouldn t open and it was warm and w o ac or fan which i had also requested and was stated to have however when we complained about the window the day manager was great he moved us to a larger room on the garden side and a fan and the window would open the room was very comfortable as was the bed the staff was friendly helpful and gracious the full english breakfast was very good and they had yogurt and fruit and cereal too the location is wonderful minute walk to the british museum and not far from the west end for theatre and close to many other museums and good restaurants
