i booked this hotel because of the good ratings on the day we were to arrive i saw some a few bad ratings so i didn t know what to expect we arrived early and left our bags while we explored high street hours later we returned to check in when i opened the room door i was happily surprised it looked just like the photos the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast was terrific we had tea service with shortbread in our room our room was near the dining hall which was good everything was great
