excellent location good value i stayed in a room facing the yard so it was very peaceful standard breakfast good choice of cereals and fruit friendly staff very neat and clean room the cabin was probably the smallest hotel room i have ever been but the size of the room was mentioned in the booking so it was not a surprise
