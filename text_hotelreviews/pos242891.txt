i have traveled all over the world for work and always stay in star hotel but wanted to do something different this time and have not been sorry from the moment i got to the hotel i was treated as if i had walk into my fully staff home this is a real review of this hotel and the people that work there there is no words so say how helpful the staff was how peaceful the area is but still close to transportion the room that i stayed in was not a big room but i was alone and it was fine for me and clean clean and a c that kept you cool in the heat wave that london is having now please keep in mind that all the rooms in europe are not huge as space is limited the hotel does have bigger room so if you want more space for two or more people my suggestion will be to get a bigger room my time in london will not have been so enjoyable if it was not for the hotel staff aaron pavel lucian and sakar these people were warm friendly and most of all helpful and happy to be so always with a smile on their face i spoke to the staff about some of the negative reviews i have read and it was explain to me that sometime their sister hotels have to send over guests because somethings may not be working at the former hotel and they have to give the guests the rooms that they have at the park grand london hype park and it may not be the best however they move the guests to better rooms as soon as it becomes available when my time was up to leave i was sorry i had booked to go to brussels because i was so comfortable at the park grand london hype park i plan to visit london again next year with my brother and his family and i have already spoken to the staff about the best rooms to get for a family
