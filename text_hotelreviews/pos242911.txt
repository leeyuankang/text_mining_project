this place had the most comfiest beds and pillows i ever slept on the staff were very friendly and were very accommodating with all the requests we got upgraded to another room as the first room we had had a weird smell coming from the bathroom i liked that room service was never intrusive and always tidied up our room once we were out exploring there was no ironing services but they can provide you an ironing board and iron the hotel was easy to get to from the paddington train station and had easy access to bars restaurants and hyde park i highly recommend this place based on location
