this is a nice little hotel my room was small but this was because i requested a room with a bath and there were only a few available i also prefer a smaller room when travelling alone the bathroom was lovely with under floor heating the bed was very comfortable the d cor in the bedroom is a little old fashioned but clean the bathroom seemed fairly recently refurbished breakfast was very nice
