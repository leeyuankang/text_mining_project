i loved the welcome i received upon arrival the cozy and quaint single room and the location i was looking for an inn near public transit with some pubs nearby the hotel property itself is beautiful and sits on a beautiful tree lined street i was welcomed immediately and since i was traveling alone it was nice to feel safe i adored my room i knew i would be spending more time out of my room but it was so delightfully cozy to come back to single comfortable bed with a giant tv on the opposite wall for late night viewing the bathroom was perfect for me small but clean and charming the breakfast was delicious i opted to pre pay at check in and it certainly gave me the fuel i needed before each day typical english breakfast with lighter options available i appreciated being able to walk to paddington to catch the heathrow express to the airport amazing location overall it is a lovely inn hotel and should i find myself back in london i will book here again no research will be required
