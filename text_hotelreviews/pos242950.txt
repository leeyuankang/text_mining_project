our stay at park grand was excellent so close to paddington station we booked a club double room and it was a lovely surprise to find it was on two floors with a maisonette living area up some stairs it was really nice to have that extra space and a proper kitchen sink and microwave as well as the complementary snacks and drinks our bed was super comfy and a special thanks to the staff who were all lovely and to whom nothing was too much trouble
