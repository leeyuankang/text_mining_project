the hotel is well located opposite gloucester road tube station there are shops and restaurants nearby and it is very easy to get to central london mins staff was very helpful arranging an early check in when we arrived at rooms well appointed and big by london standards my room faced the main road but with the windows closed there was no traffic noise i will definitely stay here again when i visit london
