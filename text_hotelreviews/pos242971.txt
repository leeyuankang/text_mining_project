firstly the service exceeded my expectations sanya and pavel by far exceeded their call of duty and ensured that my stay was very comfortable they were very friendly polite helpful welcoming everything you would love to find at a hotel i would not ask for better service from such hosts thank you guys i was also afforded early check in and a room upgrade the room was very clean comfortable quiet and the bathroom area was sparkling i also loved the buffet breakfast real value for money proximity to paddington station was a thumbs up finally the free android phone service made my movements around london much easier definately a notch above other hotels
