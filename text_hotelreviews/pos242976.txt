staff were wonderful we had a small problem when we arrived with available parking space which was sorted very quickly we were made to feel very welcome check in was efficient even though we were early one of our rooms was made available immediately so we were able to leave our luggage also brought up to the room by staff rooms were spotlessly clean comfortable individual temperature control too we like fresh air so also appreciated being able to open the windows
