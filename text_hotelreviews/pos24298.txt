my biggest fear when looking for a hotel is the state of the bathrooms and carpet so it took me a week of trawling through reviews and researching online to finally decide on a hotel to stay in and boy was it a relief and pleasant surprise when i arrived at this hotel as a professional interior designer myself i appreciate the style of the hotel decor very modern but warm and tasteful i know those wall coverings didn t come cheap it s quite evident that whoever was responsible for the design was meticulous and applied a very high attention to detail concierge services were generally very accommodating although when i called one evening asking for ice i was asked to contact room service directly the concierge from the previous two nights must have passed on the request to housekeeping without asking me to do it myself so being asked to contact room service directly was a bit of a put off it wouldn t have taken much effort to pass on the request to room service from the concierge s desk would it housekeeping team was very thorough with the cleaning i found the room to be very clean and fresh and actually better in reality than the pictures i d seen online i particularly loved the lavender sleep aid that was left at the bedside it worked a treat
