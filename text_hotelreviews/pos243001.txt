i reached london in the morning and the lady at reception was so lovely to give me a early check in the room is small compared to the photos online but it had all the amenities needed the bed is comfortable the facilities are quite old but still manageable the breakfast was great too the staff were all lovely and friendly and it was like a mins walk to the paddington station the surroundings were quiet and quaint and i would stay here again as the price was quite reasonable
