staff were as described on all reviews so so friendly the hotel was very clean and very centrally located for going to theatre and west end and shopping and was very easy to find the bed was very comfy great hairdryer a bonus tea coffee in room super bonus too dont want to fault the hotel but some things do need improvement to make me come back
