we stayed for nights and enjoyed our selves very much we had rooms one for us which was upgraded from delux room to studio room by the hotel and the kids were at delux room the size of the studio room is okay for a european hotel in the middle of the city certanly for this price and was clean and comfortable the hotel is very generous with the coffee facilitiy in the room the staff at the hotel are really nice and tried to help as much as they could with every question we had the hotel location is great the tube is very close and from the pedington station one train will take you to most locations with no need to switch the breakfast is very good and generous
