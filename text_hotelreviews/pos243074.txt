the hotel team could not have been more helpful the room was so comfy the air conditioning worked which was important to us on a very hot night the bed was big and comfy the bathroom products were perfect we loved the extra touches of having shaving toothbrush packs robes and slippers the breakfast was just right from the choice options to the way the cooked breakfast was presented and cooked we will be booking here again
