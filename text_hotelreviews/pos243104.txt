location of the hotel was excellent we had arrived earlier than the checkin time and our rooms were not ready the staff provided us an upgraded room that really helped us the standard rooms are small but cosy and comfortable we were provided prepaid smartphones to help us get around london which turned out to be a great boon would highly recommend this hotel
