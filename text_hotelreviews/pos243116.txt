great location quite near to paddington some rooms are small i was sharing a double with my daughter and could barely walk round the bed or find anywhere to put our bags we asked to be moved after one night and the staff were very helpful by booking a deluxe double we assumed a larger room but incorrectly as it turned out club doubles are more like standard size rooms so go for these if you can
