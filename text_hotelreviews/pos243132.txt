we stayed for nights in this hotel the staff was super helpful and guided us about the various tourist attractions the hotel is conveniently located in the center of town with a good balance of quiet and serene vs noisy and crowded quite close to the paddington railway station as well as the subway easy to get to all the main tourist places from here plenty of restaurants and stores around will definitely choose this hotel again
