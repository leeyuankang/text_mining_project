the staff were warm and welcoming and when we requested for an extra duvet we were given one without any fuss the breakfast was excellent and very economical we were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the previous reviews but honestly our stay was comfy and excellent even though it was on new years day thanks to all the staff for giving us a tension free stay on the first day of the year
