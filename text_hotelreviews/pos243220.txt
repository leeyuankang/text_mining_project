we booked a triple room because we were travelling with our adult daughter this room turned out to be far too small for adults and their luggage we therefore booked another single room which greatly increased the expense if i had know this was the situation ahead of time i would rather have booked an apartment in london for the same price as the rooms the single room was also unbelievably tiny i have stayed in many hotels in london with small rooms but these were beyond a joke the staff however were absolutely fantastic and did everything in their power to try and address the situation and keep us happy they were a credit to the establishment the breakfast is also very good value for money if you prebook it
