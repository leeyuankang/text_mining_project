the hotel rack rates are better then the booking com rates it really disappointed me when i got to know about it because the rack rates were including breakfast otherwise costing per person whereas booking com rates were excluding breakfast so in total we night stay we have to pay person nights we paid extra due to booking through booking com it s really disappointing
