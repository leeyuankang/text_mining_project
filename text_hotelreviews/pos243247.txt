what a great stay at this hotel as the location was perfect and price range was reasonable and the rooms are clean and perfect comparing to other hotels i enjoyed staying there because the staff managed to give me a quiet room to stay in as it was the most important thing the hotel location was perfect because the paddington station and the main rail station were minutes away it s useful for people who like to travel from place to another lovely stay lovely staff and amazing price special thanks to valeria and lucian who made my stay such an amazing time
