hotel was great and we appreciated the extra little touches like the chocolate bar in our room and lavender scented pillow spray also only min walk from v a albert hall science museum etc nice friendly pub only a short walk away called the gloucesterarms and a lovely itallian restaurant opposite the pub called da mario serving good food at sensible prices we will definitely return
