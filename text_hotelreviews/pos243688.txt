the staff were savvy we encountered some issues with the terminal they were using to charge my card and had to endure some delays while it was a tad frustrating i was pleased to be informed that they had upgraded me following the issue with the terminal access to paddington station was exceptionally easy a short walk away on flat ground which was great as well
