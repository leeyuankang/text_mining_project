there are a lot of other hotels in that area which makes for a safe and quiet neighborhood but not too quiet which for me was a plus the staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful the rooms are nicely decorated the beds are very comfy and there s air conditioning in every room the facilities are in excellent working condition and very modern looking which made me feel like i was staying in a very fancy hotel which in so many ways that really count it was
