the room was very small but clean and neat with everything i needed i had been stranded while transiting through heathrow airport because of the british airways computer meltdown so on short noitice i need something close to paddington station and other points of interest this hotel is on a quiet residential street within walking distance of the station and hyde park because of overflow i was actually shifted to the park grand london paddington so this review applies the that location
