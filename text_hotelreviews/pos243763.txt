i booked into this hotel but when we arrived we were told that they had something gone wrong in some of the rooms so they said they had booked us into their sister hotel just down the road the shaftesbury premier which was closer to paddington station they gave us a free taxi to other hotel and also gave us complimentary breakfast as a gesture for the inconvenience the sister hotel was lovely although not as nice looking on the outside the inside was lovely the staff are friendly and the hotel room was lovely had everything you would need and very clean and comfortable i would highly recommend this hotel to stay in
