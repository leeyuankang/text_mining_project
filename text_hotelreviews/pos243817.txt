the location is superb in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood from where you can easily depart in all directions to major landmarks or just stroll around if you take a careful look at the pictures shown and make out which one corresponds to the room you are booking you will not be surprised by what you get single rooms might be relatively small but they are rather well equipped mine even had a small radiator which turned out to be very practical and easy to use the one thing i found novel was the smartphone they offered with the room with free calls and data i didn t need it but for international travellers that should be a lifesaver front desk staff camelia and alexandra were the ones i spoke with were kind and always ready to answer my questions if possible i will book at shaftesbury for my next visit to london
