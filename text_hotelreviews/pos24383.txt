big room with large double beds and modern bathroom nice breakfast choice including cooked items and pastries etc staff really friendly and helpful good freebies such as water bottles in the room usual tea and coffee etc and apples in reception looked like it had a nice bar and garden area if the weather had been warmer to sit out excellent location near gloucester road tube station and only a minute walk to south kensington plenty of restaurants nearby would stay here again next time we come to london
