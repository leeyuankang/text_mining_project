nothing to like in this hotel when we arrived it was very cold and the heater in the room didnt work second night it was very hot and the ac in the room didnt work both nights the technician was supposedly off tv stopped working and a guy came in slapped it literally then it started working again wifi disconnects all the time no water in the room second day no cleaning and the individual who made the bed simply returned the duvet on top of the dirty bedsheets coffee and tea bags not given on the second night room not vacumed bed sheets and duvets had lot of dusts this was supposed to be a club room very bad experience
