great location with a few steps away from underground and mins away from the centre at night at am taxi costs pounds from leicester square to the hotel staff they made everything to make us comfortable we told them to change our room to the back side of the hotel since the front side facing to the road can be a bit noisy and the reception sent a guy to move all our stuff and back side was so silent and even we forgot to hang please clean my room thing we found our room tidied up thanks we loved the two double beds they were comfortable and huge tv and mirror is nice rooms are big enough overall we loved it and extended our stay and we hope also in the following days everything will be fine full experience will be provided at the end of our stay in a seperate comment gym is okay but enough for the one who does not want to give a break even in the holidays
