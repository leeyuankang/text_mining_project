i got a great last minute price just over pounds for double room when i arrived i was upgraded to a double club room which was spacious and had balconies overlooking the front street i also asked for a free late check out genius perk and was able to stay until lovely comfy bed very clean and attractive room with built in microwave fridge ironing board iron good quality hairdryer plenty of plug sockets including one for pin devices good bathroom although shower controls a bit confusing and nearly burnt myself the water was so hot complementary mobile which you can use for the duration and take out to make landline calls i did not use this but it is a good idea for visitors to uk good internet connection no buffering when watching now tv i paid around pounds for a full breakfast on arrival offered for around pounds when booking online which was ok i am vegan and would have liked soya milk which was not offered and a better choice of fruit etc i thought it was a bit expensive and would definitely not want to pay the full pound price for it staff were all lovely very helpful hotel kept my luggage all day after i checked out it is only a minute walk to paddington station and i walked to oxford street in about minutes i stay near paddington as get train to and from this station i would definitely stay in this hotel again although i prefer to be nearer oxford street area this was a really comfortable hotel best one i have stayed at for this price and also in comparison to some i have paid considerably more for
