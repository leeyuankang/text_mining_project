great staff and service loved the giant fluffy towels the breakfast that was included in our deal was a full breakfast with service and had excellent food and full service the room was clean and it included a local android cell phone to use for calls and the internet we use the installed guide on the phone to find shops food and attractions while we were there this is a super idea that more places should do
