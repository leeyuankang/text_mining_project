the staff was so amazing we were booked for twins so we could sleep adult with child on each bed the manager upgraded us to a better room on the floor which had a nice window with a view of the street i believe the floor we were originally booked on was a smoking floor so be sure to check so we slept adults and little ones on a king to be fair we are very low maintenance also the staff called around and booked all our tours for us although it might have been cheaper to buy online by a few pounds another great thing there is a little grocery store about minutes walking distance
