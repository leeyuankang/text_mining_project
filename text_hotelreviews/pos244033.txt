room was clean quiet and comfortable although it might have been a bit snug with adults in it air conditioning worked so was able to cool it down while out in the evening staff were very helpful and friendly i was escorted to the room since it was down a couple of small corridors and the member of staff then adjusted the air conditioning and lighting as requested
