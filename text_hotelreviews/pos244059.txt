the shower was really good and hot water was available wifi worked really good location was pretty good we didn t buy the breakfast there was a nice bakery on a way to the paddington underground bed was guite narrow for the two people max our room was next to the elevator and the door was like paper so we heard every time when the elevator came up and people talked on the corridor we were lucky that hotel was quiet anyway i think the hotel is a good option for the future travelling too
