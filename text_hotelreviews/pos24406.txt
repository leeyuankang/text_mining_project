we loved the concierge lounge to relax in after walking all day breakfasts were delicious and the bar at night had a great ambiance everyone was very helpful and polite one reason we picked this hotel was because it was one of the few with an outdoor terrace to enjoy the september weather was beautiful so it was perfect
