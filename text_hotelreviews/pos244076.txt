upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a club room at no extra cost which me and my partner were extremely happy with the room was slightly small however the bed was very comfortable the bathroom shower was perfect and had heated flooring and there was also a microwave fridge iron and ironing board present to cater for any needs during our stay upon checkout me and my partner had the intention of visiting oxford street before leaving to go home without even knowing this a member of staff offered to hold on to our luggage to allow us to visit the shops without having to lug around our bags overall i highly recommend this hotel and we hope to be staying again in the near future
