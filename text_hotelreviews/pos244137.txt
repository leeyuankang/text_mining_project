we were given a lovely room downstairs next to gym i was concerned as was in basement and was shown another room on upper floor i actually preferred the basement room it was comfortable spotless and well equipped angelo in particular was very helpful and as was my partners birthday provided us with a complimentary basket with fruit and wine etc we had a lovely stay i used gym which is small but in my opinion had what it needed for me to exercise i would def stay again
