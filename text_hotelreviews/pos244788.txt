very worn down feel the moment i stepped into the lobby curtains in the middle of lobby stayed in room n toilet was very old fashion this time not even a shower curtain at the tub to keep water out of the floor sink was disgusting with discolouration problem rubbish bin was like a public toilet with flaps next to the bed there was a mirror that looked so dirty i had goosebumps sleeping next to it in conclusion it was so bad that i paid for two night i left after a night not getting any refund n checked into beautiful gorgeous sofitel with splendid service standard from every staff
