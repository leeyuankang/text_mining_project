just a nice relaxed place to stay very friendly staff not pushy professional but not in your face the room was comfortable cakes and bubbles in the room when we came back in the evening the curtains had been drawn the towels out the even tidied up the mess i had made very attentive this is literally a stone s throw from the arc de triumph a wonderful location not the tacky tourist spot
