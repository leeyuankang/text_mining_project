the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful all the time it was an absolute pleasure to stay at the hotel the rooms were clean and tidy and although they were not large rooms they were adequate for a couple the location was ideal with a one minute walk to the arc de triomphe all in all it was a great place to stay
