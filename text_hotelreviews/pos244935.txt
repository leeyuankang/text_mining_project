the personal attention of the staff was out of the ordinary these days extremely professional and friendly the modern design and amenities of the room and the hotel areas were very pleasing and welcoming the swimming pool and fitness facility looked very luxurious and clean although we did not have the time to experience it the breakfast was superb as well as the serving personnel the best surprise was the cleanliness of the hotel since it is brand new will choose it again the next time paris is on my travel list if i want to be close to the center of the attractions special thanks to ckndy at the reception she made our experience so positive
