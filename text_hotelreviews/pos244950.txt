this is a great hotel for business close to the montparnasse train station so easy access to all kind of modes of transport certainly will be considered next time i vacation in paris the location is really awesome with a nice lively street next door and access to different metro lines in less than min walk great rooms comfortable well appointed overall really satisfied booking com has outdone itself as usual
