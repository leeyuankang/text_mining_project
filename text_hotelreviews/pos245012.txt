the location near the montparnasse station can t be beat as it s also a big metro hub and easy to go anywhere from there also there are buses going back and forth to the airport stopping right there much more comfortable than the metro with luggage as everyone can sit down and they put the luggage down the bus very comfortable hotel great bed great breakfast buffet
