we can only say all the best about our stay at this hotel we give our highest score to the reception staff comfort and housekeeping we are a young couple that were on the go for our entire stay which means that we needed a big breakfast to conquer all the beauty that paris has to offer us as tourists we needed a comfortable bed and some peace and quiet in the night and thats what we got also a good thing about this hotel is the location we were so close to all the happenings but still in a part of the city where we could experience the typical small streets boutiques creperies and brasseries
