we had to catch an early train out of montparnasse train station so the hotel s location was perfect i wouldn t necessarily stay in this area on a sightseeing trip to paris but if you need to travel onwards by tgv to the west of france the location is top rooms are standard not overly large but clean at eur breakfast isn t overpriced relatively good selection of breakfast items including eggs
