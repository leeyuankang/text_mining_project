perfect position for walking to all the main sights staff make you feel like royalty from check in to check out and even after that we dined in both their restaurants and both were exemplary we couldn t have been happier and we wanted for nothing facilities extremely clean beds extremely comfortable if it s in your price range it s not to be missed and even then the service and meals exceeded places i stayed which cost me much more thanks
