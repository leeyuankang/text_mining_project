the place is by far the best traveling to paris for a night stay over new years our experience started with a kind email from the hotel benoit offering to arrange a limo service to collect us from the airport we availed of this facility with was prompt and friendly and got us to our hotel in superior comfort on our arrival we were met by with a fantastic and warm welcome which set the tone for and exceptional stay our room was not ready as we were early but they kindly kept our bags and explored the city i did ask for them not to rush the room i m happier for it to be cleaned correctly i m a bit of a stickler on cleanliness in hotels when we returned we were brought to the room and our bags had been brought up there was music playing on the rooms ipad we were presented with complementary gateaux s from the thouimeux bakery in addition we were advised of the dring me service which is a free phone with dring me installed providing free international calls so we could ring home on new years the phone could also be brought out with you anywhere in paris it had maps app not google so we could locate the places we wanted to see and it provided up to date transport options buses taxi metro and walking this information was live so when public transport was free on new years eve it told us first we brought it everywhere and were able to make our early new years calls home with out the worry of roaming charges or the worry of getting lost the rooms are as good as they are advertised in every element from the luxurious duvet and pillows to the marble floors and porcelain sinks funky mirrors slippers and dressing gowns provided the air conditioning for me as with all hotel rooms was slightly noisy at night noting that this was the normal operational sounds for this system the engineer in me but this can be turned off from the controller in your room if your a light sleeper
