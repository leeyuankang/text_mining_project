i loved pretty much everything of my short stay this boutique hotel is located in a silent street in a wonderful and central area of paris just minutes walk from tube station and from eiffel tower lots of shops and restaurants around and amazing bakery just in front of the hotel i loved the eccentric decor of the room and the fact the hotel has only rooms feels very special a winning point was the mobile i was given for the total lenght of my stay from which i could call everywhere in europe and us at no charge and had internet connection while being around the city i ll definetely come back and next time i ll try the michelen stars restaurant just below the hotel benoit the front office manager was lovely and very helpful
