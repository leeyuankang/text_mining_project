if you visit paris often and usually stay in one of the stars hotels you will immediately notice the difference after entering the building you are warmly welcomed by nice and helpful staff who will help you with your luggage and show you the room room and especially bathroom is quite spacious in comparison to paris standard in particular i really like those hot pipes in the bathroom which keep towels warm
