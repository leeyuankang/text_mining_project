loved the decor of the hotel and the rooms once you step through the doors you see why it s called the exhibitionist i love art so this was my kind of place you are asked to chose you re own room fragrance when you check in which is a lovely touch the location is superb short walk to museums and galleries and excellent choice of restaurants and bars
