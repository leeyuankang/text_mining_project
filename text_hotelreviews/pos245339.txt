the room had a good opening window sounds odd but some places you either can t open the window or when you do its hardly worth it it was a warm weekend and we were glad of the breeze there was aircon but we prefer the fresh air the bed was extremely comfy and the toiletries were noble isle very posh and indulgent the hotel was highly decorated which was delightful and there was an ipad which allowed full interaction should you need it we stayed here for the proximity to the museums specifically for the v a which is only mins walk away the area has plenty of chain eateries as well as individual restaurants we ate out for all of our meals
