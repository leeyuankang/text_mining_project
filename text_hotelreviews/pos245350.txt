i got a good price on booking com for a one night stay here midweek the reviews i had read were mixed yes the rooms can be small i d gone for the cheapest room and it was compact but it had everything i needed big comfy bed kettle snacks coffee tv the bathroom was quite large with bath and large walk in shower which was fab the view was nondescript but it was very quiet which suited us we didn t eat or drink at the hotel great location for the museums friendly staff
