the room for a single person was good nice d cor and tv positioned well lovely comfortable bed and very clean sheets the bathroom had a bath and shower and was also very clean good tea making facilities and complementary crisps nibbles warm welcome and i was accompanied to the room to ensure i knew how to operate everything on leaving that morning someone raced to open the door and wish me a good day which was star service the tv did not work so new batteries had to be installed into the handset when i closed the curtain the wall fitting fell off into my hands the most disappointing was the lounge and dining area it bears no resemblance to the hotel when you arrive all the beautiful settees and grand chairs and large flower pots are not there this has all been staged for the website photographs i was very very disappointment as i made my decision to book because of this so that i could sit and have a coffee or drink and just relax outside my room the bar area when i returned from the opera at pm was not open but just made up for the next days breakfast i just went to my room the area is cold without carpet and not at all comfortable it is also not bright and airy as the photographs convey on the web i told the receptionist that i was unhappy and showed her the photos on my ipad in the morning however she said she did have authority to reduce my bill i paid in full on the understanding that the manager would take up my case and give me some sort of recompense with regards to the situation all that was said by the manager is that artwork is moved every weeks to other sites well why don t they update the website accordingly i am taking the matter up with my credit card company however wanted to let other travellers know what to expect or not expect this really is one for trading standards to be honest as they are not providing what they are selling on the web
