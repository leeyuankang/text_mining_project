breakfast was lovely and evening meal was delicious if not a bit expensive i can recommend the lamb very designer not your traditional lamb with new potatoes but very tasty the desert was so good we shared a second one chocolate something just delicious the staff both at the reception and in the restaurant were friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble the room was very comfortable and quite luxurious in blue velvet the hotel was very quirky colourful and had some interesting art work on all levels we very much enjoyed our time there and are looking forward to going back for a second stay when we can
