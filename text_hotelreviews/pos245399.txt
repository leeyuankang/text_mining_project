the hotel is amazing greg on reception is a credit to the hotel and was more than helpful helping to arrange an upgrade for us at an extra cost of course the room with the plunge pool is out of this world and the size of room is out of this world it has a restaurant on site but we did not have dinner but the cooked breakfast was lovely
