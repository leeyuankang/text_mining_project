the staff and the location were the best part we honestly couldn t fault either the staff were wonderful during check in and even though they were working over christmas and away from their families they were always ready with a smile and lovely to deal with we love to walk everywhere and the hotel s location is perfect for that it s only a minute walk to harrods and knightsbridge and a minute walk to london s best museums south kensington train station is a minute walk and is surrounded by a fantastic variety of casual restaurants the hotel itself is very stylish and each room is different in its design theme colour the lift is a bit slow so they ve compensated by including a white board for guests to write messages on so the time passes quickly we actually thought this was quite fun and didn t mind the time it took the room was spotless and we were well taken care of when it came to any request we had from extra pillows to extra toiletries etc we had asked for a quiet room so our view was of an internal courtyard and neighbouring buildings while it s in the heart of everything it is located on a very quiet street so sleeping and privacy are guaranteed if you re looking for a place that is well located and very affordable for london this is a great option
