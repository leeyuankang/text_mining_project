this is by far the friendliest most welcoming hotel i have ever stayed in we were welcomed at reception by a lady called zena apologies if i m spelling that wrong and she was so genuinely warm and happy i felt relaxed straight away housekeeping were very sweet and polite and i noticed that the vibe was generally just a lot more relaxed and happy than in most five stars for this reason alone i would choose this over other five stars i have stayed at in london special mention to the bar manager for what i feel may just be the best white russian in london our room was quirky but luxurious with lovely bathroom products everything from the snacks in the room to the elevator seems really well thought out you can t get more convenient than this location yet it is very quiet and pleasant to walk around with lots of nice shops and restaurants
