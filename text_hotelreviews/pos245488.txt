we stayed at the exhibisionist for just one night before our long journey home to australia from the very first moment we stepped inside everything was star artistic stylish and immaculate from the entry way all the way through to the bar and our room every where you turn is wonderful and wacky art spectacles that are eye catching and fascinating the staff were amazing especially for me as i organised the day before to surprise my partner with a proposal it s not every day the staff would have requests like this and i left it in their hands and they nailed it friendly attentive and very accomodating if you get the chance to book the drop dead gorgeous suite was stunning the pictures don t do the hotel any justice really you have to see it for yourself simply perfect
