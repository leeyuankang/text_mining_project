i loved the quirkyness of the hotel and our stay was most enjoyable the hotel has a fine quality about it the bed was so comfortable like sleeping on a cloud the breakfast was lovely again good quality food i would definitely go back and stay at the hotel but next time request a larger room with a view to the front of the hotel
