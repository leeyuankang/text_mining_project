great quirky hotel full of kitschy discoveries around every corner loved the fact we could sit out on our balcony nice quiet location near tube station staff welcoming and approachable really enjoyed our overnight close enough to chelsea flower show would come back again to the hotel bar prices as you would expect for south kensington expensive managed to get good deal in room
