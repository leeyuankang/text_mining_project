it was so different to any hotel we had ever been to everything had an artistic twist to it even the lift was fantastic we was greeted as we entered to hotel and instantly looked after we got our key and went straight to the room amazing the bed was huge and the interior design was fantastic bathroom was very modern and had a monsoon showerhead which i love the bar downstairs was brilliant too the bar staff were very polite and helped my girlfriend decide on cocktails they was never to busy to help the location was fantastic for us we was going to the royal albert hall which was a minute walk down the road perfect it was also a five minute walk from tube stations so you could get anywhere you like very quickly as there wasn t any parking for the hotel we had to use a carpark here we go again just minutes away it was a little expensive but then again it is in london lastly the night s sleep the bed was huge i like to spread out in bed and my girlfriend hates it but even when i spread out i still didn t get close enough to my girlfriend for her to complain we are close by the way we just like bed space haha so the space was fantastic comfort level i put my head on the pillow and just passed out i slept like a log which is a good thing it was so comfortable and i didn t want to get out of bed in the morning this resulted in us being late for doing what we wanted to do the next day haha my fault not the bed d i would highly recommend to any young couples who are a bit qwerky and different from everyone else because that is what this hotel is also they sold voss thank you for an amazing weekend guys
