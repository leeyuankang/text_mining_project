i cant tell you how impressed we were with staying in the drop dead gorgeous suite the photos do not do it any justice simply spectacular and such a nice treat for staying in london a real hidden gem and the staff they helped me prepare a little surprise before we arrived and were so helpful and friendly when i emailed them leading up to the weekend and on the day i m surprised to read any reviews that say otherwise simply amazing
