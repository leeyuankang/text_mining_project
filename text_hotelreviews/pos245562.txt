the decor was extravagant and inspiring and was definitely a welcome change to the usual bland hotel interiors the staff were fine an odd comment from the concierge whilst we were waiting for the lift diverting us to the stairs so he could go up to the next floor was a bit off standard but room service was efficient and friendly also the cocktails were beautifully made although they took minutes to be served which was off putting and we didn t drink in the bar again for fear of it making us late for our bookings
