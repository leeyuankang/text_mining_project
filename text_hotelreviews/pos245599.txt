stylish classy and a great location the suite was especially good on the top floor spacious and quiet the balconied room on the first floor was much smaller but still comfortable and well finished the design is great and i love the luxurious feel to the place did not partake of the breakfast as it seemed an expensive extra highly recommended hotel
