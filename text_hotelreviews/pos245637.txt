we used the hotel as a base for a show at the albert hall the location is superb minute from the hall and that walk involves going past the natural history and science museums and is an easy walk to hyde park the building is lovely and the d cor is very quirky and original the room was beautifully decorated and there were lots of lovely touches the staff were all helpful and friendly perhaps excessively so in one case
