good location and some nice quirky touches around the hotel in general the staff were pleasant and helpful in my opinion the service was ok rather than what you receive at a star hotel which is the market they are aiming at things like room service was quick and efficient but had the room been sufficiently stocked in the first instance toiletries robes etc then the call would not have been necessary the room was modern and reasonably well equipped but very small
