we absolutely adored the design of the hotel it was clean and comfortable with really friendly staff to help you the bedroom was stunning and we loved our little balcony which had a table for i was delighted that the bathroom had both a bath and a shower had seen this when i booked but couldn t quite believe it as finding this in london for a reasonable price is especially difficult the bath was brilliant and the shower superb even the toiletries were a little treat on top of this i felt that the location couldn t be beaten it s a minute walk from the tube station which means it s close enough for a comfortable walk but distant enough to be away from too much noise we really loved our stay and would recommend the hotel without hesitation
