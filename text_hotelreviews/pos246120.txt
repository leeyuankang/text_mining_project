unfortunately when we arrived it was extremely hot in paris the air conditioning was not working and after the third day of it being more than degrees f we asked to have a different room as the fans that they provided did nothing to cool the room as there was no access to outside air that definitely cooled down in the night the new room was fine as it was on the north side of the hotel and didn t get much daytime sun it was just great
