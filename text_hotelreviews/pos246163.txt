we enjoyed having a tea tray in our room the room was made up and cleaned daily bathroom was immaculate and i was relieved to have a bath and not just a shower as many hotels have because of the weak rand we only had one breakfast which we enjoyed but there was a supermarket close and a patisserie where we bought fresh croissants and rolls etc
