the reception person who assisted me was not very friendly he did not even greet upon seeing me i requested his assistance on a baggage claim as he understood french and i did not the airport gave him information that was vital and he gave me the incorrect information resulting in me wasting three hours travelling on a train and looking for a place that did not exist i was already exhausted and needed to go to see the iffel tower with my family due to his negligence we were late and were limited due the time contraints i would never recommend your hotel to any of my friendsand family kind regards brian sauls
