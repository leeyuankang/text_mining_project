we loved our stay here the staff couldn t do more for you the room was beautiful and the location is fab one street over from chiltern st handy if you can get into the desirable chiltern firehouse to eat few mins walk to marylebone high st with it s quirky shops and eateries there s a sunday farmers market within mins walk just behind the hotel which is definately worth a look would definately stay here again and recommend to family an friends
