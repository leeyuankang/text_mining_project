as soon as one walks into the reception area in a hotel one is hit by the first and most lasting impression of a hotel it s staff within minutes i knew that i was going to have a great time the staff were wonderful they managed to maintain the perfect level of professional friendliness that is particularly difficult to achieve without exception all the staff were polite helpful and seemed to have time to make sure we were enjoying our stay and to make us feel that we were the only guests they had the hotel is a little tired looking in some areas and undergoing some renovation work this is being carried out when most people are out and about for the day and the staff were happy to explain how things would change i will certainly be returning for both work and pleasure
