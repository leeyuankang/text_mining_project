minutes from heathrow airport with the heathrow express walking distance to paddington tube station and shops and restaurants i was tired of old rooms in the other hotels this hotel has new rooms and small but a nice bathroom they also provide a free smart phone for your stay for local calls and internet there is a short cut from the hotel to the main street so no need to walkt around the park to reach to the hotel
