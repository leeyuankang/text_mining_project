the staff were very friendly and the rooms were small but nicely furnished very comfortable beds bathroom again was small but good the staff helped us when we needed a dr for our daughter i will stay again and highly recommend this property there is a nice little park in the middle of the square where the hotel is located and it was off the main road so was relatively quiet
