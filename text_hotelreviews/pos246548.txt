the hotel was very modern new in appearance and clean the staff was very kind and accommodating they allowed us to store our luggage on the last day in their luggage room unexpectedly our room came with a smart phone equipped with data free to use this was very helpful in walking around the city since our phone did not have international data this hotel was very conveniently located to paddington station would definitely stay here again
