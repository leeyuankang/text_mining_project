a chic hotel in a convenient location the room was tastefully appointed and the bed was oh so comfortable nice to be able to open the window on a cool evening located on a quiet square with a peaceful green space a perfect respite from the chaos of london just two blocks from paddington station with easy access to and from heathrow the staff is friendly and helpful try the london bike share system and take a ride on the canal trail north of paddington station head east to caunaght road for pubs and interesting restaurants away from the tourist hordes near paddington
