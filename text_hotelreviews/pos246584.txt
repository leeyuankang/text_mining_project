our overall experience in this hotel was good we stayed for a total of nights and had the standard room location the location was great since we are touring london paddington was one of the best stations to live close to since you can easily transfer and take different lines there are several types of restaurants near the hotel as well indian greek lebanese italian steakhouses fish chips pubs etc rooms and facilities the rooms were clean although a bit small if you have several luggages like us big cabin size then you might need to re pack your things every night and put them away after getting what you need to make room for some space the toilet was great and modern we had no problems with the hot water and the floor was heated which was really nice especially as it was still quite cold when we stayed there front desk reception everyone in the front desk and reception were nice and accommodating everything was done efficiently and sometimes they accommodated some of our special requests they know how to properly handle customers so it was really pleasant communicating with them
