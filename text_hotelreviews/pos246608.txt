loved the location near paddington but also far enough away from it to avoid all the low quality parts of that area staff were great room simple smallish but perfect for solo traveller breakfast was great and gym facilities very new and good quality would definitely stay here again ps big recommendation is the victoria pub away what a fantastic little traditional pub
