i have stayed in many hotels from grandiose to humble and i would just like to say that the mercure was superb great hotel but what made it was the staff a wonderful group of people who made me feel very welcome and not just the hotel staff but the girls in the restaurant too warm friendly helpful and always with a smile on their faces i cannot rate them highly enough stay yourself and see
