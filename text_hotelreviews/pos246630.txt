the hotel is newly refurbished very clean and everything in the room was in working order love the warm rain shower and comfortable bed although just a tad too high for me to hop in there was an ironing board in the room which is helpful for those who need to iron out the creases to look good for an important meeting the lift was not working yet but the staff in attendance were very helpful and carried my luggage up and down floors of stairs excellent location near to london paddington station restaurants caf and souvenir shops overall a great stay
