the check in staff were so pleasant and while they hadn t recieved a request from booking com for an extra bed they immediately upgraded us to a room which has a pull out bed thank you and thank you to the kind housekeeper who came to make up the bed she was delightful we were thrilled with the location walk ability was wonderful public transport was immediately out the door and the area was really a fun one to be in
