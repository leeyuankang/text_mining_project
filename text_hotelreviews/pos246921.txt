this was an excellent choice the location is ideal close to an rer station and just minute walk to the tower and champ de mars the staff was incredibly friendly and with attention to detail the room is impecable and the bed is very comfortable i was there on easter sunday and they even left me a note and a few chocolate eggs as a welcome souvenir this is a a night room and i was upgraded for free to a a night room and only paid due to a promotion on booking com
