for a four star hotel next to the eiffel tower the deal given at the time was outstanding value for money excellent overall location with a metro and an rer station nearby the quieter seventh arrondissement is great for those looking for fewer crowds than st michel or the area around opera stylish hotel with decent service good wifi
