the rooms were very clean and cozy the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was tasty and the location was great there were of us in a group and we easily walked to the eifel tower the louvre and the christmas markets the metro stop was just a block away and easy to figure how to get to the notre dame cathedral it was a wonderful stay with hassle free arrival and exit with the shuttle to and from cdg i would definitely stay there again
