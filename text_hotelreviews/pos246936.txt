our junior suite had a view of the eiffel tower and was very spacious for people the king size bed was so comfortable the staff were very accommodating you could walk to the eiffel tower in about minutes there were many cafes and restaurants close to the hotel and metro stops with a few minutes walk if i ever visit paris again in the future i would definitely book this hotel again
