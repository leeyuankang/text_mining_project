this was our honeymoon and we had an exceptional stay we were upgraded to a superior room and everything about the room was perfect there were a few things that really impressed us we saw your hotel as a boutique hotel in that we estimated there were only around rooms which was small enough to make our experience and interactions with your staff very personal having access to a mobile phone which made searching for information and navigating around paris very easy and convenient the condition and layout of our room was top class and overall the price of the hotel with the discount and the quality of the room and positive experience we had gave us good value for money
