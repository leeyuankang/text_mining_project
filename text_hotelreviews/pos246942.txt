the hotel was very nice bar area great lobby area great our room was clean and very cozy the beds were so comfortable that it was hard to wake up because we were in such a deep sleep bathroom had all the regular amenities needed all of the staff went above and beyond and truly exceeded our expectations the location was perfect we could see the eiffel tower from our room no parking on site but that wasn t an issue there was an affordable parking garage around the corner a minute walk from the hotel the hotel has an area in front of hotel to drop off or pick up your bags so no need to drag them from the parking garage we would highly recommend staying at this hotel great value for your money too
