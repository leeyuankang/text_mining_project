we enjoyed our stay at the derby alma so much the staff were extra friendly and helpful contacting people even by phone that we needed the room was large the bed the most comfortable of any we had slept in for a while the view of the eiffel tower from our window surprised us and the location was the best i felt that we got a great deal with the level of this hotel and its location so great
