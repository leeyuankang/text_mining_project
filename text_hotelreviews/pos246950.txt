the location is perfect the bathroom was really good in size and water pressure was perfect service is excellent and we truly recommend that you enjoy a coffee or a drink on the terrace outside the hotel to do some people watching it is a much better option than to go to the restaurant cafe that is in the corner in front of the hotel
