the location of the hotel for the price is great we were lucky enough to be in one of the rooms where you can catch a glimpse of the top of the eiffel tower from the window the room felt very warm and was clean they provide a small refrigerator and room service the location is not too far from a local shopping street as well as the eiffel tower
