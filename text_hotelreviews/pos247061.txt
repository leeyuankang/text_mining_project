the service was exceptional all staff incredibly care about small details each single employee in the hotel makes me feel that they know my personal preferences and serve me accordingly there exceptional service influenced the whole trip rather than just the stay in the hotel that was through their very helpful and knowledgeable concierge the location is perfect it is located in the hub however it is away from city noise the room and the bath were clean and elegant this stay raised my standards of hotels service quality
