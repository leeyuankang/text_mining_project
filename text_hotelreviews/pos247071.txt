this was one of the best hotels i have ever been to and i have been around the world staff are professional and very friendly at the same time the hotel decoration is beautiful gives the feeling of old english the room was fantastic comfortable will all needed amenities every thing in the room and minibar is complementary not including alcohols all tips are also included in the rate so you don t have to tip any one nor do they expect to be tipped the hotels restaurants service delicious meals there is nothing i disliked it was all great and beyond our expectations highly recommend and would definitely come back here again
