i was actually moved to the paddington court location a block away from the london paddington still park grand chain i appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just london short walk to either paddington or lancaster gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of paddington i would definitely return here in the future
