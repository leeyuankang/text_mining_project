fantastic location in marais only a few steps from bastille and plas de voges staff were extremely friendly and helpful we stayed in the gold room room was very clean and the shower was probably the best hotel shower my wife and i had on our day trip in france room size was slightly larger that expected compared to other equivalent paris hotels we have stayed at in the past our room overlooked boulevard beaumarchais but it was extremely quiet double glazing comlpletely blocked out traffic noise we only spent one night at the hotel but it was our last night in france and this was a perfect venue and a very confortable last night stay we will certainly stay there again and strongly recommend this hotel
