in my opinion the grand is exactly like the perfect hotel should look like very cozy room firm mattresses air con a bonus of a good size fridge and microwave good quality toiletries free unlimited drinking water to pour in a bottle plus to zero waste karma good noise isolation what else one could wish for great bar downstairs the location is super comfortable to be honest we have never thought we d rent a hotel room near trafalgar square for such budget friendly price we are definitely coming back to the grand
