could not have asked for a better hotel whilst staying in london my sister and i had bought a trip to london for my mom s birthday and we thought the grand was reasonable the room was big compared to others i ve stayed in in london and the room was ready upon arrival at which was a pleasant surprise we checked in and were on our way when we returned in the evening the sofa bed was made up and extra towels were in the room as requested the staff could not have done any more for us and the location was brilliant only a minute walk to charing cross tube station
