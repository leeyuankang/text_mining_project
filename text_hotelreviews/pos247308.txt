the location is as good as it gets in the middle of all main attractions very close to the embankment and charing cross tube stations and you can walk anywhere i ve stayed at many places in london but this was by far the best our standard room was very spacious and very quiet despite this very central location we did ask for a quiet room you don t get woken up neither by street noise nor by other guests passing by your door the bed was large and very comfortable and wifi was free and good the bathroom was small but clean the hair dryer as very good there was a little kettle and complimentary tea and instant coffee there was a filtered water dispenser in the corridor close to our room and you could fill up your bottles anytime
