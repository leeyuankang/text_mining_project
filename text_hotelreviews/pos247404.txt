not much this was booked on the april through booking com my requests were a quiet double room with a bath and if possible with a view i called your hotel on friday to see if all okay however the male staff that answered clearly told me he had no record of my reservation that was obviously the start of the saga i had to then call booking com costing me time and money they assured me l was booked in so l called your hotel and your olga verified my booking not a good start when we arrived it looked impressive however they were still sorting a room out so we had some drinks and food at the bar and that was good after this it was all downhill
