this hotel is very convenient everything we d planned to do was within walking distance our room was reasonably sized and had an open view a firm comfortable bed and a large hd television the hotel was spotlessly clean throughout our room was a fraction cool though i d rather a slightly cool room than an overheated one it may be that i didn t understand how to operate the heating
