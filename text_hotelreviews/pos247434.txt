location of the hotel was fantastic with everything you need a stone throw away i like the fresh water and ice on every level of the hotel too readily available the bed was comfortable and the fridge in the room was a bonus there is a tesco express under the hotel for all your requirements we had a room on the front of the hotel and the room was nice and quiet we didn t use any of the hotel facilities purely because we were so busy i would recommend this hotel purely for location purposes
