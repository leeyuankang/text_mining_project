the service i received at this hotel was absolutely outstanding the staff were unbelievably polite professional and helpful especially gerald who was our host at breakfast and throughout the day was always on hand to help our every need the breakfast was lovely they had a selection of everything to suit everyone and it was so fresh and never ran out of anything as it was constantly attended the rooms were immaculate and a good size we got a warm welcome and goodbye from the staff every time we came and went i loved the warm cookie we got on arrival i liked the lighting in the room as you could set it to dim or bright which was good for bedtime the hotel is only a tube away from everything to see in london and the station is only a minute walk the area itself is immaculate and has lots of restaurants and bars
