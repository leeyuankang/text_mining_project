the room was very good for the price considering the quality of the linens and comfort of the bed also the cost of the breakfast was included and it was very copious with all the coffee we could possibly want and a very good selection of fruits yoghurt cereals breads pasties eggs among other offerings all included in the cost i booked on this site and got a very good rate for a triple room as we were traveling with a child very good location near the train station we were leaving the next day and overall good value for the money
