location was great just off trafalgar square tube near by close to the riverside and close to theatre with a little tesco next door but one stayed in family room which had a fridge kettle and microwave so nice to be able to sort a warm drink out on at bedtime and simple breakfast in the morning and of course have a bottle of wine chilling after a long day out and about staff really friendly and helpful asked for more pillows as they was only one each and we all like two and they were waiting for us on return
