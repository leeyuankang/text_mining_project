i mentioned when i booked the hotel that it was my birthday on the date of stay and when i arrived at the hotel we were informed that we had been placed in rooms with great views which was a nice surprise and they also wished me happpy birthday during the check in which was lovely when i got to my room they had left a bottle of wine and some snacks and a little london fridge magnet which i thought was another lovely touch there was also a card wishing me a happy birthday from the hotel management needless to say this started my visit to london off very well indeed the room was larger than i expected despite only being the small room as described on the website and the bed was very comfortable i could hear no road noise or noise from other guests at all over night and i was generally very happy overall with the room standard and all it s decor furniture and supplies the shower was hot and very powerful and the complimentary toiletries were of a high standard check in out was very quick and the staff were cheerful and professional the entrance hall looks great it is shared by the grand hotel and the bar and lobby area is beautiful
