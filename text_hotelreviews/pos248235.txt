although considered a business hotel this hotel certainly has a lot to offer in addition to its proximity to areas of interest and sightseeing opportunities the hotel is well appointed steps from trafalgar square on the left and a short minute walk to the thames if you head right while the hotel food can be considered expensive there are several good restaurant options including an italian restaurant near trafalgar getting around the city is easy with charring cross station a minute away and many tour buses and if you have to spend time in the room rest assured that although the rooms are not large by american standards they are more than adequate with the bonus of free in room wifi and free bottled water comfortable for single travelers if sharing consider that the bathroom counter space is lacking although i didn t have an opportunity to meet matthew who assisted me in booking i will say that he and all who were at the front desk were really welcoming including house keeping services who i had to arrange a ironing board and iron and who were prompt with delivery in all i would highly recommend this hotel for the overall experience
