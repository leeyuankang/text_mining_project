perfect location nice ambiance within good service alas we could just see the houses of parliament and big ben but they were visible the studio was more than satisfactory very good bedding well appointed although the decor was dull and not very creative had a nice walk in shower very helpful staff room service was available from other restaurants so you had a full choice and i loved the architectural elements of the old building it was wonderful
