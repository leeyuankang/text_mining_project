this is a very comfortable hotel in a great location just off trafalgar square with easy access to two tube stations and buses it is not budget but is value for money staff were polite and helpful the reception is located so that staff can greet you as you walk past to and from the lift and they were solicitous without intruding the room was large and very well designed one aspect i hadn t seen in other hotels impressed me on each floor is a free water station with iced filtered water and disposable bottles no pound bottles from mini bar or waste by leaving bottles in room to be half used there was also a guest cupboard on each floor with extra blankets iron and ironing board breakfast was good and reasonably priced by hotel standards
