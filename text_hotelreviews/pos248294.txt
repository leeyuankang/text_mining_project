room was big with lots of cabinets and compartments which made it helpful we had lots of luggages with us there was a large table with chairs which meant that we could easily bring takeaway up to the hotel and enjoy it there there was also a microwave and a small basin area every floor has a water station which is pretty common in uk hotel nowadays with bottles which saved us some money from buying excessive amounts of water the staff were friendly and useful even though we had one blunder where one of the staff had to get us in the luggage room to identify our own luggage otherwise the staff were great even though it s literally a minute walk to charing cross station and opposite trafalgar square it wasn t particularly noisy as we were put on the floor i m not sure what it s like if we were put lower down as i assume it can get quite loud the location is brilliant as it is just a short walk to the thames minutes to leicester square soho area and a minute walk to oxford circus as it was my family s first time in the uk that was particularly convenient as it was scorching hot and we wanted to avoid the tube at all costs there is a pret mcdonald s tesco express a walk away too the area is always crowded so it put us at ease when we went out at night
