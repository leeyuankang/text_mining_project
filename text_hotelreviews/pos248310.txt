this is an amazing hotel for the price and location right in the heart of trafalgar square this place was an absolute treat and is definitely somewhere we would visit again the little extras like the purified water bottling station in the corridors and the attention to detail in the upkeep of the room made this a perfect night and for a reasonable price
