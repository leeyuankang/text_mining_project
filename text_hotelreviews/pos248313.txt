the hotel is in a fantastic location and very near embankment and charing cross trafalgar square we walked across the bridge from waterloo and enjoyed the southbank and buzz of the festival hall food market and cafes restuarants and bars the hotel staff were very helpful and gave us an upgraded room this is the second time i have stayed here and really like it we had breakfast at a local cafe and there is plenty of choice top class location that makes travelling round london so easy we booked late and got a great deal but so much depends on the day of the week and time of year will be back
