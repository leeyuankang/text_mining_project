we booked in an emergency from the hotel lobby our other hotel reservation was cancelled by the hotwire risk management team without any kind of notice so we were in total surprise we walked back to the grand this was our other hotel of choice when we were booking the previous day talked with james on the reception booked online and had two room keys in about minutes after entering two floor rooms with actual view over the adjacent rooftops the potential view less room s was the reason we put the grand on a second place on our initial choice breakfast was nice and plentiful tendering to the room and our belongings was perfect the personnel was polite helpful and fast great stay thanks for saving us in the middle of london p s the mattresses and linens were just perfect
