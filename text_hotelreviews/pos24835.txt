the staff seemed very genuine friendly and welcoming i hate it when someone says have a nice day with no eye contact its so insincere the hotel was really lovely furnishings decor fire in lobby location the restaurant staff were excellent and the breakfasts were excellent too tasted freshly cooked and not mass produced and kept warm like so many places i am disabled and nothing was too much trouble and the approach from staff to me was just right helpful and supportive without taking over i really appreciated that
