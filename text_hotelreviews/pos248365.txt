excellent front staff friendly eager to help went an extra mile i booked the room for many many of its attributes such as location room size and bed arrangement for my family of three free wifi etc etc and among other things in room safe which unfortunately was not featured in the room assigned but was otherwise exactly what i booked for they promised to move me two floors down exact same room on the third day of my night stay on that day full of local activities we agreed to come back to the hotel around pm to pack and make the move to the room with the safe by then previous guest would have moved out and housekeeping would have finished the cleaning we returned at pm and were told we ve moved we were a bit puzzled as we have not packed nothing packed and we had unpacked everything upon check in with all sorts of clothing in as many drawers as we could find three people s clothing on hangers snacks and drinks in the cupboard toiletries in the bathroom shoes parading by the door i said let s go to the room and packed as no way we were regarded as having moved we returned to the earlier room and found it cleaned up and cleaned out concerned to the point of getting worried as though i have taken all my valuables with me in a backpack to go about my day s activity there were medicines and kid s favorite masterpiece of colored drawing the night earlier his lego set half done and so on so who and how that was done and could anything be overlooked or missing or regarded as unwanted trash hurried down to the new room with staff from both the reception and housekeeping to ensure that if there should be anything we found missing we would have to deal with it on the spot voila everything i mean everything was neatly placed back into the new room right down to the scrap paper drawing by my little piccaso the only chore was to unload my stuff from my backpack into the safe
