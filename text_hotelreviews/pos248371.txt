trafalgar square club quarters is a very impressive hotel from the outset i am a great fan of clubquarters cq and stay often in their various london hotels on business trips this was my first stay at the trafalgar sq hotel and all the staff and facilities were welcoming and helpful the room was quite large for london standards superior queen and this cq was more old european hotel in flavour as opposed to the more modern style cq elsewhere in the capital staff were all excellent ophelia and dan in particular at reception were very kind and professional i certainly would recommend and stay there again but then i would recommend all of cq in london standards and management is high and supportive they care about their guests and it shows because we return all the time
