the location is just amazing i have no heart to move out of this place you step out and it s a party scene outside the national gallery the hotel is great too staff are really friendly and the rooms are amazing it is on the pricier side but that s understandable given the location would be great to have smaller affordable rooms that are cheaper on a longer stays
