my son and i used to come to this hotel a few times a year to stay a few nights and much enjoyed the neighborhood and the hotel the bathrooms were well thought out and though the rooms are rather small they were comfortably equiped with lots electric plugs good bedding complementary tea coffee basic cosmetics and bathrobes fresh apples at the reception desk and we especially liked the friendly and helpfull staff at the reception who we got to look forward to seeing again on our next visit
