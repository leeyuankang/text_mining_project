the best hotel i have stayed in in central london the location was absolutely fantastic a stone s throw from trafalgar square and the national gallery just across the road is the wonderful sherlock holmes pub and it is within walking distance of the west end and we went to see a fantastic musical room is spacious and modern it even surprisingly had a microwave oven the staff were very helpful and friendly i also liked the water ice machine on the same floor as our room with free bottles as we could top up before going out haven t seen this before and thought it is a great idea especially in summer
