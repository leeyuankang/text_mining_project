tesco is on the corner so was an easy walk to get fruits and snacks daily or alcohol small selection but good nonetheless wi fi was good and strong bar in hotel the gym had the essentials elliptical free weights treadmills but quite compact in the room with free weights can t have more than people as there just isn t enough room to do exercises properly which for me is ok since i do tend to travel with my resistance bands so whatever i can t do in the gym i just finish up back in my room
