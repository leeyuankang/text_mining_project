hotel changed to double tree whilst there so a bit of renovation going on but did not inconvenience us housekeeping did not clear rubbish a couple of days and toiletries left a lot to be desired in the bathroom no cotton buds etc we had s great stay however as it s an excellent location concierge were helpful in booking our christmas day tour we would stay here again
