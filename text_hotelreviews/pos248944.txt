the location is fantastic in the heart of one of london s most charming neighborhoods you feel like a resident the hotel is decorated with great taste and they have paid careful attention to the details my room was on the smaller side but definitely suitable for one person i am a particularly light sleeper and found it to be very quiet and the bed is very comfortable the bathroom features modern fixtures and is decorated just the way i would decorate the bathroom in my own home the atmosphere of the common areas is very pleasant and the staff is welcoming and friendly there is a generous breakfast offering that includes a wide range of options i highly recommend this hotel i felt especially comfortable as a solo traveler i will definitely return during my future visits to london
