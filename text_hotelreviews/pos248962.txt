the hotel is amazing it s on the beautiful street close to portobello market and just next to the tube station rooms are really nice and bed is super comfy there is also a huge mini bar with a lot of drinks and snack plus with the whole set to prepare your own drinks the staff at the reception is really helpful in the morning you can sip your coffee on the ground floor with the view over a nice notting hill street
