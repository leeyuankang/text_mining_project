the hotel had a great location and the staff was very helpful we opted to get the smallest room and it was a little snug but the immaculate bathroom made up for it excellent selection with regards to the toiletries neal s yard a unique mini bar offering and a wonderful hooded bathrobe that is available for purchase at the lobby walking distance to the market and other excellent restos very close to the tube station it s the little details that make this boutique hotel a great find coupled with the super friendly staff a different london experience
