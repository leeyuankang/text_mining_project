good location with easy access to paddington station and other tube stations and bus routes nearby short walk to hyde park staff were very eager to please and helpful with extra tea coffee items in room umbrella loan taxi s etc have stayed in this area several times before and this is a good hotel consistent with others in the area for the size of room and price a bit quieter than those closer to bayswater road some really nice little pubs cafe s and restaurants around the area away from paddington central
