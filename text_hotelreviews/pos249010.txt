fantastic location especially for the price and great collaboration with respected art galleries and local businesses like sally clarke for baked goods coffees etc thoughtful touches including varied minibar and quirky details great bathroom and toiletries reception area and public rooms small but very well done with decor and architectural details sympathetic to the historical building appreciated healthy menu options
