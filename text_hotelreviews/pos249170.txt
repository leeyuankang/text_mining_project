this hotel is an excellent location close to all paris highlights and with easy access to rail and metro there is a fantastic mix of restaurants nearby and the hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet a few notes there is currently construction outside the facility but this didn t impact our stay it just created confusion for some of our uber drivers re getting to the hotel rooms are small and don t have room for kids families to move around relax in this wasn t a problem for us as we spent our time outside enjoying paris
