this was a beautiful luxury hotel an oasis of comfort the location is excellent but the whole square outside was torn up and all streets were blocked to vehicles so it was confusing for taxi drivers coming and going it is comparable to a hilton the room was fabulous modern clean and comfortable the staff at the reception and concierge were fantastic friendly and beyond helpful the breakfast was incredible fresh fruit all kinds of breads hot food and beverages etc
