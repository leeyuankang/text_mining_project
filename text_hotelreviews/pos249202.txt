the staff at the desk the busboys and the concierge were fabulous i switched rooms twice because was not ready and the other room setup was not as comfortable as the other one and they were fabulous about it excellent food in the restaurant and great breakfast selection tea and coffee and room fridge was a real plus we arrived early and they went out of their way to accommodate us the young guys were so sweet and respectful and helpful the location is great we walked to the louvre notre dame and the river seine huge shopping area and restaurants around the corner of the hotel the price is great for all this i would definitely stay here again
