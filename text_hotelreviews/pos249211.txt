breakfast is very good except for the scrambled eggs that come from a box and have a very non natural texture rooms are spacious modern and comfortable sound isolation is good considering how densely packed the building is the engineers did a good job in dampening the noise staff is very nice and they try their best to help guests deal with the inconveniences such as absence of parking and the massive construction happening outside the hotel
