hotel was in a great location and close to everything there is construction outside but to make a new metro entrance which would be right outside front door of hotel our bed was like a cloud the window in our room opened which allowed fresh cool air into the room love that the shower glass could go from frosted to clear at the push of a button breakfast buffet had great selection of food
