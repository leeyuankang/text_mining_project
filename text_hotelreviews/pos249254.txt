the bed was sooooooo comfortable especially after a day of travel and sightseeing for which the hotel was well located and central the breakfast service was beyond my expectations and absolutely yum the service both in the dining and at front desk very friendly i liked that they had no problem keeping our bags for the day after checkout so we were free to do more sightseeing
