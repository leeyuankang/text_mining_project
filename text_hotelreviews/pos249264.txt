third floor room very modern and comfortable hotel is in excellent location for sightseeing walking distance to notre dame louvre and pompidou centre lots of local redevelopment occurring but didn t have negative impact on us and when complete will be truly amazing this hotel is ideally situated for access to metro and this makes wider paris and disneyland easily accessible lots of local bistros and cafes for sitting and relaxing
