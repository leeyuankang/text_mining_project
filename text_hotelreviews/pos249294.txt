this is a great hotel my family consisted of seven adults and three children and we occupied four rooms in total so having rooms with sofa beds helped the staff was fantastic and very helpful want to give special mention to anthony and nicholas we could not have asked for a better location the hotel is one stop on the train from gard du nord and just a few minutes walk to the louvre and other attractions
