i loved the easy check in our room executive twin had superb beds the lobby was great wifi also very fast location is very near the chatelet les halles train station making it very accessible to other areas in the city and outskirts just be mindful of pickpockets in the train station because they can be very aggressive our friend was pickpocketed in m line within seconds
