breakfast was good value as children were free meaning we effectively paid euros each it seems a lot but included cereals juices coffee yoghurt pastries cold meat and cheeses as well as eggs bacon sausages we didn t need lunch and nearby cafes bars were charging minimum just for pastry juice coffee we were surprised but pleased to be given a room with two proper single beds for our children rather than the double sofa bed we were expecting
