this is overall a good property unfortunately i was placed in a location closed to the service elevator where every night the laundry was delivered at and the clanking noise of the elevator would wake me up i have stayed in other rooms and they were just fine the staff offered to moved me but i was settled and was busy with work and had no time to move
