for me this charming hotel was perfect just around the corner from the theatre des champs elysees and conveniently located near the metro and bus service i would certainly book here again for a wonderful dining experience try mollard a beautiful art nouveau restaurant specialising in french seafood but serving other dishes as well lovey food and elegant service almost a step back in time located at rue saint lazare loved it
