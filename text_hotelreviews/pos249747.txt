we stayed only two nights in paris however we all enjoyed our stay thanks to the staffs in the hotel their hospitality was amazing and we would love to go back there again in addition to that regarding the room i think the size was bigger than other hotels in paris the location was perfect as well you can access to effiel tower easily and do shopping in champs lys es if you want to stay somewhere convenient but not too busy location this hotel is the best one for you
