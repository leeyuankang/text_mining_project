such friendly staff i emailed prior to arrival to ask a few questions and was promptly answered with courteous care each time i made contact they also arranged for our airport transfer what a life saver room was clean and freshened daily what a joy to return from an adventure late in the day to find a neat room and fresh linens in bath we were always greeted with a friendly smile and kind word regardless of the time of day location is ideal just a block or two from champs elysees and other areas of interest we were able to walk to most attractions
