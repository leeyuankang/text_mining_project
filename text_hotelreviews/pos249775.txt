location was marvellous we enjoyed the walk to and from champs elysees avenue the rooms were very pleasant with reasonable size and elegant decorations the beds and pillows were super comfy with excellent housekeeping service the dining room was very cosy and clean and the breakfast was reasonably ok the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful definitely we would come back to the same hotel on our future visits to paris isa
