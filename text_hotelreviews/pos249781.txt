great location in a tranquil residential street just off avenue montagne champs elysees and with the friendly greeting from the concirge we immediately felt relaxed after miles of walking around an exhibition hall all day very authentic adn typical parisienne some would say dated but i liked the old charm room was absolutely spotless one of the cleanest ever stayed in
