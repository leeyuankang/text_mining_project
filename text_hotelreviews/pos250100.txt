extremely comfortable bed clean room and great to have onsite underground parking at not a bad price perfect suite stay for two adults and my grown up nephews they made the sofa beds up as two singles which was much appreciated even though we didn t request this nice shower with separate loo it worked really well the guy who helped us with parking didn t get his name sadly was really helpful
