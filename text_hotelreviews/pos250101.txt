great location of the property short walking distance to eiffel tower louvre museum champs lys es didn t use public transport so cannot comment on it clean comfortable room wifi worked well in the room was given a bottle of water after we ve settled in the room i guess the reason was to compensate for having to wait for the key to the room due to the delay at the time of check in
