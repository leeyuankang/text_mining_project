i loved so much about the location it was great for us as we had the hop on hop off ticket and the closest stop was at the grand palais super short walk away we were there for the christmas season and the market was super close as well there were plenty of restaurants nearby and it was still so quiet and peaceful the on site parking garage was great for us we parked the car and forgot about it until it was time to check out it was nice to not have to worry about it the staff was excellent we felt like we truly mattered to everyone we encountered i believe this place set the mood for our entire trip to paris we cannot wait to go back and stay again the one bedroom was great for our family of four i think it had the best sofa sleeper i ve ever seen and the kids said it was more comfortable than any they had slept on in our many travels
