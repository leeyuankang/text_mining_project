fantastic hotel with perfect location in a very lively central neighbourhood it is however surprisingly very quiet the rooms are not very big but they are very well equipped with a large comfy bed there is clearly attention given to the decoration of both the hotel the rooms which is charming amenities are of great standing as well but the best is by far the staff of the hotel they are one of the nicest friendliest hotel staff i ve met
