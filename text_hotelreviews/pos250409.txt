a lovely hotel in a lovely area with lots of local restaurants with good reviews close by the reception staff went above and beyond to help they helped with booking and printing our tickets for the louvre when we arrived and finding us a local restaurant at short notice the location was perfect for us if you don t mind walking and getting to see the area it s a simple minute walk from gare nord the metro station is less than minutes away but you can easily walk to galleries and printemps in minutes the room was small but as expected with a centrally located hotel but was comfortable and clean and fine for our one night stay i honestly cannot fault hotel arvor
