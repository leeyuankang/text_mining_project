lovely hotel rooms were modern clean and super comfortable our room had an amazing view over the rooftops we could even see the eiffel tower and as the hotel is on a side road it was also very quiet we heard no noise at all either from inside the hotel or out breakfast was buffet style but lovely and had something for everyone
