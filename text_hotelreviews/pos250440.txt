very nice staff lovely communal areas room had a view of the tip of the eiffel tower the hotel is also in a nice part of town just a short walk from montmartre but also close to the central city it s on a nice quiet back street and the immediate neighbourhood has a lively feel with many excellent looking dining choices would absolutely recommend
