we enjoyed our one week stay at the hotel the staff were extremely friendly and helpful it was just a short walk to get to either the pimlico or victoria tube stations our room was very clean and comfortable nicely updated and modern we appreciated that the hotel provided us with a complimentary smart phone that was preloaded with maps and city guides very handy for first time visitors there was a nice selection of items for breakfast and the service and setting were excellent
