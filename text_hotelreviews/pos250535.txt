very nice hotel room small but it was all that was needed and not smaller than other hotels i ve stayed in when in central london brilliant shower although make sure you let the water in both the normal shower and the cascade warm up before you switch from one to the other or you could get a shock comfortable bed quiet room friendly staff and good continental breakfast with plenty of staff around to help my partner s brother and his partner live in sweden and mentioned they plan to use this hotel for their base in the future when in london
