much more of an intimate boutique hotel than is suggested by the picture the room we had was smallish for people but not by european standards the bed was comfortable the staff was very accommodating and the continental breakfast was fantastic cold meats cheeses yoghurt fruit croissants and on and on really nice bathroom with rainfall shower and yummy toiletries the lounge has a couple different seating areas and the bar was always open the location is excellent just a stone s throw from pimlico underground
