the staff were very friendly anybody booking a hotel room in central london should manage their expectations of the size of room they are going to get the room here was bijou but was adequate for my purposes room was saved by having rainfall shower rather than a bath and by having a queen bed rather than a full size double but since i was travelling alone this was fine the hotel is within walking distance of pimlico tube and in a very nice area of london
