everything about our stay at the belgrave hotel was amazing and there is nothing better than having a great hotel to make your stay in a new country special the cost was great and included free wifi and free breakfast which by the way was so good the staff is very friendly the location is incredible right next to an underground station and a bus stop and only a quick minutes to get to central london everything there is very comfortable and very clean which was so important to me when deciding on a hotel to go with highly recommend and would definitely book again
