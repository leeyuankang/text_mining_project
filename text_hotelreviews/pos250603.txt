cleanliness decent size single room by london standards location very close to victoria train and coach stations the continental breakfast was very good and varied including lots of fresh fruit yoghurt and croissants in may case it was included in the room price but otherwise it was very reasonably priced by london standards about gbp for a the self service continental option but if you paid some extra pounds you could have some cooked options
