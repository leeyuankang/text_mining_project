the hotel entrance was nice and open and the breakfast dining area was bright and modern nice walk in shower very modern room although it was small staff were polite the buffet at breakfast was very nice area was ok and was good for walking to the attactions which took about mins tube was ok although if you go to covent garden to see the shows you need to get tubes there and back so a bit of a trek but overall not bad
