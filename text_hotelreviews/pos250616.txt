from the moment i arrived at the belgrave i was met with a warm welcome by george even though i arrived early and my room was not yet ready george graciously took my bags so that i could start my day off exploring this beautiful city he also was exceptionally knowledgeable on the best routes for me to take in addition i found the location to be extremely convenient to the victoria station coming in from gatwick airport on the gatwick express which i highly recommend and a short walk to the pimlico station from the hotel you can either walk from victoria station mins or take the victoria blue line one stop to pimlico minute walk to the hotel an uber was about pounds i also recommend uber getting around as opposed to taxis as they are much more cost effective i found the belgrave hotel also very walkable to many of the main attractions i was able to walk to tate modern and continue up the road to westminster abbey house of parliament and big ben to name a few i also was able to get around using the tube which is pretty easy once you get your bearings on the routes the nice thing is there is always someone in the station to direct you this a boutique hotel which is nice change from the big chain hotels i felt as though i was living among the brits that may also reside along the row of townhouses on belgrave the hotel is very new and clean the room is a decent size and average for oversees and the bathroom was large and roomy it was stocked with tea and coffee they even give you biscuits and water there was a refrigerator great as their is a wine store around the corner safe full size hairdryer iron and the wi fi was very good housekeeping did an excellent job at cleaning the room each day they even washed my champagne flute each day for me i don t think you can beat the price either also i would like to add i m a solo female traveler and i felt extremely safe from walking to and from the tube even in the evenings
