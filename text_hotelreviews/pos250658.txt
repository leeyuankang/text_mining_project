location worked well for us being near to victoria station yet a reasonable walking distance to westminster south bank etc pimlico is nearest tube station maybe minutes walk smart looking interior good use of space in the lobby small bar and three small lounge areas friendly staff no problem storing luggage either if arriving early or leaving late
