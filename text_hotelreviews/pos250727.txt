breakfast was fabulous it was continental but there was everything you needed plus could purchase hot items if you wanted we didnt need to bed and linen were very comfy the room was small but it s london they were fantastically equipped though location was perfect mins on the victoria line to euston get off at pimilo as the hotel is right around the corner number bus goes past the hotel too but takes a good mins to get into the centre of london
