staff at reception and breakfast room is helpful and attentive it s quiet and peaceful at the hotel but badly soundproofed between floors the wireless internet worked fine the hotel is close to tate britain and subways with few stops to all major sights there are not so many restaurants nearby but try the pub white swan or the indian restaurant millbank spice in vauxhall bridge road which has great food and service the hotel serves breakfast only
