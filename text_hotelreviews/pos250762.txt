the belgrave is the best hotel i have visit so far in london it is clean and fresh the staff is very helpfull and nice the breakfast is very good with lots of fresh fruits and healthy options the location is excellent in a nice and quiet neighbourhood close to underground and there is some good restaurants close by my sister and i was soo pleased and we will return for london next spring and we will make sure to book at the belgrave
