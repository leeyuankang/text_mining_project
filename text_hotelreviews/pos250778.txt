the room was big enough because in london you shouldn t expect the big rooms if you only take a standard room the breakfast was superb yoghurt variety of fresh fruit bread pasteries the staff was very friendly we had dinners within minutes walk max meter from the hotel and they were all great and with good price cool extras like newspapers and magazines wifi
