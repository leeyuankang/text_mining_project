the belgrave hotel means a lot to us as we got engaged here in so i decided to take my partner back for his birthday when we got to our room there was a bottle of wine box of chocolates and a birthday card from the hotel staff which we thought was a very nice touch the location is perfect and we had a great view of the london eye and big ben the room was very clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable
