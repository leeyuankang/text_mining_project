the decor in our en suite room was contemporary tasteful and it was clean and comfortable really nice shower everything you needed hairdryer iron etc room was a good temperature i d stayed once before on business and my room had been cold no matter what i did with the heating breakfast was nice continental was included in our rate but on the second day we had full english and eggs royal which were lovely it s closest to pimlico tube which is just a five min stroll so it s a great base for seeing london would stay again
