superb location for exploring central london by foot or getting round by tube public transport staff we re very helpful with our room bags as we arrived several hours earlier than our allocated room availability time breakfast offered a very good range of continental style food items but the cooked breakfast was excellent and well worth paying the small extra for the shower ensuite was luxurious
