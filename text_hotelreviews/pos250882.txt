thoroughly enjoyed my stay staff was friendly and helpful my room was delightful single room on the top floor with lovely view of pimlico rooftops and church steeples just the right size for one person no closet or wardrobe hanging rack on wall but no big deal for me my room was right by the elevator but wasn t noisy at all i usually avoid rooms by the elevator at all costs but had no regrets staying in this room hotel is in perfect location close to victoria station and pimlico tube station great neighborhood with restaurants shops etc can t wait to return
