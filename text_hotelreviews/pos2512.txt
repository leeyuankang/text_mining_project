flexibility staff very eager to please quiet area near to lancaster gate tube and hyde park where we had a great morning having coffee and cakes at the lido cafe also enjoyed the traditional london sing song at the duke of kendal pub on sunday night handy for the bus which took us all the way to kings cross much easier than the tube
