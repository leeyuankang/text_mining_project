friendly helpful staff small but well furnished very modern room very quiet and had everything i needed powerful shower in a light and bright bathroom breakfast was great had salmon and eggs and they were more than happy to leave the toast off the continental breakfast looked comprehensive although i didn t have any of that great coffee from a bean to cup machine small detail but it makes the difference about a minute walk from euston station and minute walk to regent s place where my meeting was would stay again
