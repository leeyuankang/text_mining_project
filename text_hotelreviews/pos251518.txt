cannot rate the receptionist on check in enough he was professional friendly and enthusiastic every time we encountered him from arrival to departure for us he was the best asset to our stay as he diffused when we felt annoyed at other things the hotel is in a great location for people travelling to euston and we were surprised to discover just how close it was the food we had in the bar was excellent and the staff were also great there room was very comfortable and we were asked on arrival which room we preferred we asked for the quietest and we heard no noise at all the shower was wonderful and we liked having hand sanitiser in the room in addition to the usual toiletries
