the best experience of the staff was the gentleman at the front desk who let me stash my luggage for a few hours whilst i went to my meeting the woman who was on reception when i arrived seemed nervous and was distracted and the girl who brought my dinner up from room service forgot items and had to come back and was awkward basically stayed silent whilst delivering the tray of food
