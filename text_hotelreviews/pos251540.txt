we were upgraded on arrival to a superior room so ratings reflect this as i suspect we had a bigger bed than standard and it made the stay seem better value for money the room was very well furnished and tasteful staff were really friendly and attentive breakfast lovely we just had pastries but lots more available the breakfast room had modern decor and a nice atmosphere
