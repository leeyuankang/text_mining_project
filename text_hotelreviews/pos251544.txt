my room was tidy and clean and the daily cleaning service is a real added value in london all the receptionists were friendly and tried to make me feel comfortable both the classic sweet breakfast and the traditional british breakfast were tasty and the service was fast it took minutes to have the complete traditional breakfast surprisingly the breakfast mushroom is the best i ever tried in london the location is functional it is near to two different underground stations miles away from euston station central victoria northern lines and miles away from euston square station hammersmith city line
