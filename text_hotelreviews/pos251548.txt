it was a real good bed and very clean room breakfast was promised on line and in all the publicity for this hotel to be a full english one but only week before our arrival there was communicated that the breakfast would be continental and that s a pity this is not correct the restaurant of this hotel however is a top restaurant and we recommend it to all visitors of london
