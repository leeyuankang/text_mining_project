the room a superior double was big and the bed was very comfortable there were blackout blinds on the window which is my current favourite thing in any city hotel where light can come in the staff were really friendly and helpful the location for euston couldn t be better but my room was pretty quiet more noise from the air con unit which was off so don t know why than anything else but nothing to worry about
