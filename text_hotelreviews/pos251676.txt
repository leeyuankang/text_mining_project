the staff were friendly and helpful for a superior double was more than i wanted to pay especially as it was room only that said we had nice good sized room which was quiet as requested just a three minute walk from euston station the location was perfect for us the bar was excellent and the barman cheery and helpful had a great espresso martini cheesy chips and onion rings at which rounded off the stay a treat
