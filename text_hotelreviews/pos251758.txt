bed was so comfortable nice quiet room surprising as it was street level accommodating for late checkout great location without stupid pricing would definitely go back we live in london but booked this hotel for an holiday evening as we had a function in russell square it was such a lovely stay that even though i had to go back to work in london for a night shift the day of departure i felt as if i had actually been on holiday highest compliments as such
