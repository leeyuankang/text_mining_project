must husband and i stayed at the wesley hotel for new years and we were really pleased the rooms were cosy but modern and clean the bathroom was immaculate with a decent shower and the beds were comfortable the location right outside euston station was perfect for us as we re happy to use the underground and it s right on the northern line which is very convenient the staff were helpful and have been very helpful in arranging the delivery of some clothing items i left behind thanks eva all in all the wesley is great value for money especially london prices on nye recommend
