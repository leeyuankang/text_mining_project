the wesley is centrally located closed to the euston st pancras and kings cross train stations but on a side street that is relatively quiet it bills itself as a budget friendly hotel and it is but it is top of class in that category the rooms are clean and new and bright amenities are good the onsite restaurant offers decent selection and quality it also is a socially responsible hotel
