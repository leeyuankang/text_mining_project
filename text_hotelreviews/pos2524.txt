i have never stayed in this hotel before it was easy to get yourself lost in westminster borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till i have eventually have found the destination it made my life so much easier as i ve never been around in this part of london before when i walked in to the main entrance i was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room my club room was beautiful but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery it didn t fuss me much though the cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was enormous i had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of merlot never to late to drink on your arrival why not the best part of the hotel was the breakfast i didn t like the breakfast i absolutely loved it as it was the best breakfast ever everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts the restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home they were so lovely and i felt very accomplished to half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star well done to all and be prepared for my next visit xx
