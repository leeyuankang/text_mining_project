loved the jazz club great entertainment went with my grandson and he really enjoyed the location the food the room was very comfortable the breakfast was wonderful this was my second visit to this hotel and i will return again at my next opportunity the restaurants near the hotel were as good as i remembered from my last visit the hotel was very helpful in making sure that we got the twin beds that i was concerned about i called booking com practically every day before this trip and was told that i could only find out when i checked in whether i could have a twin room or not this aggravation was unacceptable in future i will use a travel agent
