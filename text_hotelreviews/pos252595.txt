located in in a really nice area down a short road from some cafes and restaurants and a very short trip to the arc all staff were helpful and friendly no rudeness or coldness about being non french speakers it s a very large hotel with a very vibrant entrance hall if you re like me and prefer that atmosphere rather than a small and not very populated place
