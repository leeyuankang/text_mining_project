an exceptionally hipster hotel the interior design was fantastic and we loved the bar reception area where we met friends in the evening the fireplaces really added to the atmosphere of the hotel the rooms themselves were comfortable and functional but most importantly quiet i was only based on the second floor and was not disturbed by the music downstairs in the slightest the bar and reception staff were brilliant friendly and welcoming as were the door staff in the evening a quick flash of the room card to show that you re a guest is also a fantastic power trip when there are people waiting to get into the bar in the evening
