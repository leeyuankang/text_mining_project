this is a very stylish and well thought out hotel in a vibrant part of london with lots to see and do and great transport links the room was great with lots of little features that give it a wonderful sense of identity and the inclusion of a roberts dab bluetooth speaker was great as we aren t really tv people the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also excellent with good quality toiletries available
