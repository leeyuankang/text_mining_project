loved the room comfy bed adequate size not big but you don t exactly need lots of space in a hotel room there was enough room for a desk and an arm chair and space to move around i loved that you could borrow a bike for free there was proper milk for your free tea and coffee and a small breakfast in the room was also free these little things when many other hotels seem to charge extra for every little hints these days restaurant was great too and the communal areas really great
