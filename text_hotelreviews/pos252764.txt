we stayed in the hotel over our wedding weekend as it was located close to our venue i d made a request ahead of our stay which they kindly took into account and accomodated during our stay the staff were extremely helpful friendly throughout all the prep and after our big event the rooms are well equipped and clean and the hotel offers most facilities you could want and you can t beat the location for convenience if you need anything else the bar and restaurant downstairs are both great too with good food and plenty of seating options for either meeting friends or having meetings would stay here again without a doubt
