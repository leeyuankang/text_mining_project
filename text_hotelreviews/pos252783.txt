room was modern and very comfortable the hotel is in a excellent location and the bar area is lovely i let the staff know on arrival that it was my boyfriends birthday and they arranged for a balloon and a bottle of wine to be in the room for us to enjoy which i thought was a lovely touch i really enjoyed staying here and will defiantly return in the near future
