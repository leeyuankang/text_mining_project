the hoxton is an extremely cool east london hipster hotel and hang out we loved everything about it from the cozy areas to sit and read a book to the delicious food from the hoxton grill the old skool photo booth and of course the amazingly squishy beds the room was on the smaller side but everything about it was great the whole experience felt personalised to us and they even left a happy birthday balloon for my boyfriend in the room the bathrooms are lovely and the shower was big hot and powerful you get a little breakfast included in the price which got delivered to our door at the chosen time a nice little touch there are little quirks all over the hotel and the staff are a very friendly bunch we loved everything about this place and would highly recommend it
