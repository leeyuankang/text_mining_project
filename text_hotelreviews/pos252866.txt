great room very comfortable and well furnished breakfast being delivered to the room worked brilliantly as we just wanted to relax and enjoy not having any child care the hoxton grill located in the hotel looked wonderful for breakfast or lunch the evening crowd was buzzing close by is shoreditch market and the dennis severs museum both well worth a visit will definitely return as really helped make my birthday weekend in london special
