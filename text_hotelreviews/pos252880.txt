had a trip to london with my son and picked this hotel because of position and reviews we were not disappointed a very lively bar lounge and bar area greets you as you enter with a modern open plan reception to the left we were dealt with very quickly and professionally by very curtios staff who also booked a table at the very busy restaurant the room though not large was very well thought out and was perfect for our needs large flatscreen tv tea coffe free wifi mini bar with complimentary water and fresh milk there was a lot of quality little touches that enhanced our stay and i would recommend this hotel without reservation
