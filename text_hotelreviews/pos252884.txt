everything it s witisism and it s energetic atmosphere we came pre christmas to celebrate a wedding anniversary in our old stomping ground it was everything we wanted friendly staff were very attentive and their informal but efficient approach felt well pitched location is great easy walking distance of spitalfields market columbia road flower market sunday and brick lane and everything hoxton shoreditch has to offer at night would definitely go back and would take our teenage children next time they would love it
