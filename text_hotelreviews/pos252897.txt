perfect location for exploring the streets of hoxton and shoreditch so many restaurants and bars pubs to explore two days was not enough we were allocated a concept room on the top floor which was lovely i am sure all rooms are as equally as well appointed would certainly return for another city break balloons in the room for my partner s birthday were so great thank you
