great vibrant place to stay location is perfect the cool vibe hits you as soon as you walk in with people relaxing with coffee wine and fizz chatting working and eating you can stay at the hotel and have everything you need or just a small walk you have lots of choices of restaurants bars cool coffee shops i would certainly return for business purposes and or pleasure
