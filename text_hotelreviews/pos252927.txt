it was simply amazing the vibe is so chilled and everyone is so friendly the quirky touches just make it that extra bit more special and you can tell they have paid a lot of attention to detail we requested through booking com a room on a higher floor and with a nice view and did they deliver or what they put us on the highest floor with a city skyline view that looked just like nyc the lounge area is great to take out your laptop and get on with some work or just chill and the table tennis room is just great the surrounding area has a hipster vibe and there are some really cool places to eat and drink there s a co op store right opposite the hotel which comes in handy too overall this hotel is awesome and would definitely recommend it to all
