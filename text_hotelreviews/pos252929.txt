great atmosphere in the hotel reception and bar area both during the day and in the evening the small free breakfast delivered to the room then the option to have a larger breakfast downstairs for which you simply pay for what your order and is reasonable priced is brilliant very comfortable beds great shower great toiletries the rooms are well sound proofed so noise from the street and the hotel bar late at night is virtually non existent
