the hoxton was one of the nicest hotels i ve stayed in in london we loved the reception bar area as the decor is very cool and has a relaxed atmosphere enjoyed playing table tennis too we ate lunch at the hotel one day and it was lovely i had the halloumi burger which i would recommend the hotel is in a good location not far from old street station and walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants
