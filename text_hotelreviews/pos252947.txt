loved the decor of the hotel and the relaxed atmosphere my wife and i had a room and my year old son did too we all absolutely loved it the hotel is busy and feels cool and has a great vibe the staff we re really on the ball too like the neighbourhood guide went to three places and all exactly as described we paid extra for the late check out which is a brilliant idea
