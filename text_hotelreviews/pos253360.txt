we arrived at the hotel early around and requested an early check in if possible they took our bags and we received a call an hour later to say our room was ready we arrived back at the hotel and our bags were in our room they then gave us a late checkout complimentary location is excellent dead central five mins walk to piccadilly circus station and within walking distance of everything beautiful hotel lovely rooms with generous bathroom for central london staff were so polite and helpful definitely stay again
