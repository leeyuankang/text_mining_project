visited with my daughter we were noticed welcomed and offered help the moment we arrived bedroom and bathroom were nice and comfortable the restaurant offered a very good but not splendid dinner menu the breakfast was splendid traditional english with high quality like organic free range eggs and so on there were also lots of offers at the meny included which we could order the service was excellent all staff so nice and friendly the location of the hotel in mayfair was very central surrounded by shops for the rich lovely decorated for christmas but luckily short walks to other areas for the more common of us like hyde park covent garden oxford street and more but the best of al is the location so close to haymarket the theater district i can highly recommend this hotel
