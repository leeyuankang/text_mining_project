very friendly and helpful staff travelling with a year old so all the little things like greeting her with a little bag of sweets a gift pack in the room and her own set of toiletries made our stay very memorable we also arrived very late so the kitchen was closed but when i asked where i could walk to get some chips for her as she was hungry and had looked forward to having that when we got to london the cook fired up the fryer and made her a nice portion definately a hotel that goes the extra mile
