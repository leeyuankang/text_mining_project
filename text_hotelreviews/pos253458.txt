the cavendish is in a great location with so many shops and restaurants on your doorstep the hotel room was comfortable if a little small for two people initially i was put in a room with just a shower but they very kindly changed my room later in the evening to one with a tub which was kind there didn t seem to be any public lobby areas in this hotel but i didn t visit the restaurant on the first floor so maybe there is some public space there i would only visit this hotel again if the room rates were a good deal as they were this time
