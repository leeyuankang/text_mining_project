although the room and bathroom were quite small they were more than adequate even for a night stay the pre theatre dinner was very well priced and the food was delicious the staff were so accommodating helpful thoughtful and nice of all of my visits the london and the many places i have stayed near the mall buckingham palace marble arch near oxford street marylebone etc this location was the best for quick access and short walking distances to the tube the museums shopping theatres the mall and hyde park etc and the price was good for the location will stay there again but ask for a larger room
