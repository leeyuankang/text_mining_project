perfect location minute walk to green park station or walk to piccadilly walkable distance to big ben buckingham palace oxford street or regent street rarely used my oyster card wonderful staff rooms are about the right size for london hotels kept very tidy and clean good restaurant suggestions overall it was an excellent stay would come back again
