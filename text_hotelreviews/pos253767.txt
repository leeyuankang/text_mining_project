i would recommend the avo hotel to anyone wishing to stay in this part of hackney the staff were very friendly and the hotel was spotless although a very old building inside all fixtures and fittings are new and on trend the rooms are small because of the building s age but this didn t take away from our enjoyment we would certainly stay there again
