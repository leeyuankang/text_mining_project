this was a pretty good location for overground and east london there was complimentary hot chocolate tea coffee and biscuits and there was free wifi the room itself looks pretty much like it does in the photo s very boutique looking and has a big size tv if you are looking just for a place to crash and don t mind the way you need to get to the room and the price then you will enjoy this adventure
