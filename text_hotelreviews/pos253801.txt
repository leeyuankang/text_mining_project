the hotel was clean comfortable and the room was just as it appeared in the photos yes the room was compact but i had done my homework so no surprise the shower room was perfectly adequate for a normal sized person all the usual stuff was provided clean towels toiletries tea coffee hairdryer etc it was a couple of minutes walk from dalston junction station and easy to find very quiet no noise from traffic or other guests
