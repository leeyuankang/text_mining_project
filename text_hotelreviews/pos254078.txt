everything was spot on room more than adequate for three guests spotlessly clean lovely bedding bed comfy microwave etc provided ideal for a stay of more than a few days location brilliant to tube station all staff friendly could not do enough for you had basement room really quiet as was all the hotel did not pay for breakfast but complimentary breakfast offered although no kettle in room there was a free coffee lounge well worth price would recommend and without a doubt stay there again
