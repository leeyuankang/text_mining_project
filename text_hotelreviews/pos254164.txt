the bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows regarding breakfast that was a really strange meal there was scrambled egg fried egg tomatoes hash browns tinned mushrooms and baked beans in bain maries together with the odd halved chipolata tinned sausages plenty of cereals toast cheese fruit etc and crepes so didn t go hungry was just a bit strange
