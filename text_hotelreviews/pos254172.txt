it is brilliantly close to baker street underground and also within short walking distance to the sherlock holmes museum the room was just what you needed for a couple staying in london for one night a room with a bed and a telly and a nice size bathroom too some folks might find the room small but if you re there to sleep then it s all good the bed was huge and really lovely and comfy lots of plug sockets for the gadgets including a usb port stylish room very clean
