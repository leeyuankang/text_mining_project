trying to find a hotel in central ish london that costs less than a kings ransom is difficult i chose this hotel for its location close to marylebone station and its price i wasn t there for a holiday just a convenient overnight after a work do it was ok probably what you d expect at this price point the main thing was that the room was clean contained everything that was needed and the bed was comfortable i actually slept quite well despite the constant road noise outside
