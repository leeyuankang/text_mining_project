the location is excellent easy access to both underground baker street and shopping oxford street and also regent s park is just a stonethrow away the hotel seems quite recently refurbished and it s tastefully decorated i also enjoyed the usb charger in my room as well as the free wifi and excellent choice of tv channels the small fridge was a pleasant surprise and in my opinion such a thing should be mandatory in every hotel
