the location is excellent min walk from baker st tube min walk to paddington and oxford st is only about min away the hotel has been recently renovated by the look of it and it s clean and cheerful breakfast is included and it s quite varied and plentiful served in a lovely room in the basement the staff were all nice and helpful quite unusual for london the hotel was great value for money for me but perhaps that was because the single rooms are not the best and therefore they are cheaper
