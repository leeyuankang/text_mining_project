htl fullfilled my expectation for my short trip to london with my daughter good room rate clean good location that the breakfast was included surprised me in a good way of course the staff at the front office damian i guess as seen on the receipt was very friendly and helpful he did not only do his job but he showed his attention too it was nice we had first the room on floor facing gloucester place road not noisy but u could hear the busy street unfortunately the outside window was broken and only the inside window closed it was too cold and he moved us to the floor on the following day
