i booked this hotel because of the great value for an amazing location in marylebone and it didnt disappoint the place was small but clean and had everything we required for a three night stay sightseeing in london the staff were incredibly welcoming and we got complimentary breakfast and stored our bags for free on the last day which was perfect minute walk to baker street tube station would recommend this hotel thanks again to the staff
