spent three days in mid november a short holiday trip the hotel has been completely renovated just a couple of months ago the staff was really nice and the continental breakfast really good the location was wonderful just a or so minutes walk from baker street underground station perfect to go everywhere one would like although on a quite big street the room facing on the back on the third floor was absolutely noiseless
