staff were pleasant and friendly comfortable rooms very clean throughout on arrival we were told that there was an issue with the building and that we were being moved to a partner building which was fine the staff helped with our bags and escorted us to our new room the only thing i would say of the location is that it isn t very obvious that it s actually a hotel and there aren t any signs until you come up to the door
