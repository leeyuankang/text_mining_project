i lost my wallet in the taxi as i arrived staff were exceptionally attentive concierge showed me the closest taxi rank in case they were there before calling the taxi company to request on my behalf very nice of staff to help me as much as they did thank you the hotel itself is beautiful outside and i don t think the photos do it justice hotel was impeccably clean and relaxing room was spacious clean and very comfortable location wise it is in a beautiful up market area close to all monuments highly recommend
