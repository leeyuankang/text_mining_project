great communication between the hotel and me after the booking was confirmed they made it possible to get the room a couple of hours earlier on the arrival day i have to say since years i travel to downtown paris in the arr and the le clef has the most kindest staff i ever head the rooms are modern and very large perfectly located just a few steps away from the trocadero so it is possible to have the great view to the eiffel tower in the morning and especially at the evening thank you to the residence manager anita steinmann for having such a great friendly crew we will come back to le clef next time again
