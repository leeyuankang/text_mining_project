staff were excellent though the hotel has an odd way of arranging room service were you fill out an order form which they collect before getting the meal delivered some time later so allow lots of pre notice before you eat also room service closes at an early ish so not ideal for a romantic get away but the hotel is stunning the location is perfect the staff do a good job of being welcoming efficient
