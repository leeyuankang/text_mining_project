the staff really do go that extra mile from the second you arrive the food is fantastic especially the english breakfast we regularly stay and have never been disappointed the family rooms are very spacious which helps when you have cots prams to fit in we find the location great for walking to various museums parks restaurants the area around the hotel has a really nice vibe we always manage to find a family friendly little cafe or shop that our boys will want to go back to again and again
