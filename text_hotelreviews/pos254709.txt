room number that we chose was huge with absolutely fantastic double bed incuding uncountable number of pillows modern furniture and spacy bathroom with both bathtub and a shower and you can see the top of the eiffel tower behind the window it was t cheap but this was the best quality choice when compared to other hotels in the area very close to the trocadero with a number of shops and restaurants in the area
