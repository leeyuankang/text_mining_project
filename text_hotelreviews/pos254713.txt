the staff was very nice and answers any questions you might have at anytime they treat you very well and the bed and location is always clean and peaceful i would recommend this hotel to anyone ever visiting everything you want and need to see is in walking distance the sightseeing bus even comes and pick you up directly from the hotel verses a meeting location
