the staff were amazing so helpful polite and friendly we got an eiffel tower view which was delightful mid to top of the tower visible from window due to other buildings in the way but still very special very tasty little pastries macaroons and croissants put out during the day as well as coffee and an honesty bar to boot very gorgeous hotel location was great perfect for what we wanted min walk to the trocad ro then a further min walk to eiffel tower about a min walk to the arc de triomphe and champs lys es the hotel was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and would definitely return
