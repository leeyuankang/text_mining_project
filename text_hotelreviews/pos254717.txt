the staff were very friendly and helpful the terrace outside our suite where our group had lunch on a nice afternoon was great the constant availability of coffee in the comfortable lounge area near reception was a nice touch and a nice way to start and end the day although traditional teas suited to the english palate rather than more glamorous varieties would have been nice would certainly stay again
