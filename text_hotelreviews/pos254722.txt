excellent all round the location is quiet and you feel like you are away from the tourist belt although the eiffel tower is just a short walk over the river staff were friendly deluxe room was lovely we didn t have breakfast so can t comment on it the frog xvi over the road is good for a drink and american style food restaurant jamin just round the corner has excellent french food and service at very reasonable prices uber to tourist spots like monmartre averages about euros would stay here again
