i just returned from a night stay at citadines suites arc dr triomphe paris and their attention to detail and the treatment i received from the concierge to the housekeeping staff was phenomenal they really cared about making my hotel stay as comfortable as possible housekeeping made sure my room never lacked of nespresso coffee and clean towels i definitely appreciated the complimentary large bottle of water waiting there after a long flight and the l occitane toiletries their gym facility is also very impressive the hotel can easily rival any star hotel in my opinion
