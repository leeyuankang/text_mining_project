loved the manager s special touch when i mentioned that we are on our honeymoon entire room was decorated with rose petals including the bathtub there was a bottle of champagne and chocolates for us really sweet of the hotel manager to make it more special its just mins away from the eiffel tower which made this stay much more memorable
