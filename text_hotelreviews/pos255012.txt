the hotel is honestly a hidden gem the location of the hotel is great with so many different shops etc easily accessible as it s located on a fairly busy high street the tkmaxx is amazing it s a minute walk from the hammersmith station which was around a tube ride from london euston our room was located on the floor with a beautiful sky light the decor of the room was really modern clean and fresh our bathroom was spotless with a beautiful waterfall shower head the staff are so helpful and very accommodating their breakfast although lacking hot food you can receive a cooked breakfast on request was pleasant i can t speak highly enough of this hotel we couldn t hear any hussle and bussle from the main road the bed was so comfortable and was freshly made by the house keepers everyday we stayed for nights and it was great the size of the room was fine for us and my boyfriend is we fitted in a double bed perfectly fine so not sure what other people were moaning about the room came with a kettle tea coffee sugar etc there was an lg flat screen tv built into the wall which had freeview a hair dryer was also given with plenty of room storage available the staff are so lovely if you were to have any problems they would try their best to resolve them luckily for us we had a pleasant stay here with no problems what so ever if you can ask for a room on the third floor as the sky lights are beautiful and give the room so much natural light to make up for the fact you don t have any other windows i will definitely come back here again definitely a would highly recommend this hotel
