the room and whole hotel were spotlessly clean all staff members were extremely helpful and polite from the point of entering on our first day to when we left we didn t eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food but the selection of hot cold drink options within our room was excellent the bed was extremely comfortable and the air conditioning was a welcome essential during our stay
