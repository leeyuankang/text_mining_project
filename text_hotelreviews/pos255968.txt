we have stayed at this hotel before in one of the more expensive rooms and so for the price we were paying we expected a much smaller room but it was a nice size light and airy and very comfortable the shower was one of the best hotel showers i have come across it is a great hotel in a very nice area and we had a good stay will stay again when we can
