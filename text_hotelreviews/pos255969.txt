my favourite part of london having lived there previously and always enjoy my stays at the zetter a peaceful oasis in the heart of town with the best cocktail lounge in the townhouse and surrounded by great restaurants worth paying for the slightly larger rooms and enjoying lounging in the morning over breakfast in bed
