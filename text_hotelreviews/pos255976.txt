comfortable bed and lots of room it was nice to be able to open the windows too breakfast was excellent really good quality food it was great to have bottled water and hot drinks freely available the bose speaker was a nice touch but the connection was not very constant staff were friendly and helpful and the location was just right for going to fabric one of the main reasons i chose this hotel genius perk of late check out was a real bonus
