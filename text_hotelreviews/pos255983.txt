the staff the location the decor the vibe although right on busy clerkenwell road the double glazing meant there was no problem with noise we had a corner room which made excellent use of space and had enough room for a couple of chairs for guests to sit in clerkenwell is a minute walk from st paul s cathedral and there are various transport options with farringdon station nearby and buses on clerkenwell road but we wanted to get to know the area so did a lot of walking there were many places to eat nearby but it was good to know we could come back to the zetter and have a pleasant meal in the restaurant or in our rooms staff were all so pleasant and helpful and really made the stay for us
