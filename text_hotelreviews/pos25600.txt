the location is great right in the heart of shoreditch walking distance to a train near a lot of fun bars and restaurants for a certain type of trendy person who values a hipster sense of cool above all else they d probably really like the style of this hotel the staff were perfectly friendly and helpful with the few questions i did have the beds and pillows were clean and comfortable
