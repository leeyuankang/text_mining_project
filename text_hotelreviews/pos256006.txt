i stayed here with a friend in early july we chose the hotel because of the building the design and good reviews the hotel is the right side of funky by that i mean the design is funky without being impractical although the hotel is on clerkenwell road the area is quiet and i had a good night s sleep within easy reach of oxford street on the bus all the staff were very friendly from reception to the housekeeper cleaning my room special mention should go to fabian on reception who sorted out a problem with the reservation via booking com and olga who served breakfast with a smile the hotel has a map of clerkenwell with recommendations for bars and restaurants we tried sosharu a japanese restaurant that was expensive but excellent and st john which does traditional british food also very good clerkenwell itself is an interesting area with many old industrial buildings worth exploring is the nearby museum of the order of st john st john s ambulance housed in the former entrance to the priory of st john we also walked to islington and looked around the regent s canal a very enjoyable stay and nice to discover a new part of london highly recommended
