we have stayed in many hotels all over and this has to be one of the nicest and friendliest the hotel is cool hip modern and comfortable the staff were engaging friendly and always wore a smile we ate in the restaurant on the second night of our stay and the food was delicious it is maybe a minute walk from the hotel to st pauls cathedral where we began our bus tour of the city which i highly recommend overall we really enjoyed our stay and i would say the hotel is excellent
