great place for a weekend from the moment you walk into the lobby you feel right at home if your home is a very hip and stylish place where bikes and lps are decoratively hanging on and off walls of course the staff is very friendly attentive and helpful be it at the reception or in the bar the rooms are small but cosy and come with a decent selection of records to play on your very own record player bonus points for the twin shadows album it s surprisingly quiet in the rooms considering the buzzing energy of the neighborhood in the downstairs bar at times particularly on weekend nights
