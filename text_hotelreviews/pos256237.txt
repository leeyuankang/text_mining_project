the staff were very friendly and accommodating helpful when asking how to get places or the best things to do around town the actual hotel is such a hotspot during my stay a movie was being filmed there which was quite riveting to watch it s very easy to travel by metro from this location seeing as the metro station is located directly across the street and the hotel can provide you with maps that are very informative i would recommend this hotel to others and i definitely will be back in the near future
