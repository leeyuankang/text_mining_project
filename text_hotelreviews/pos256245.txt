the perfect hotel for lovers get a room with a river view the dock view rooms don t afford much privacy and the small clean and intimate rooms and showers are made for a passionate visit to paris it s unique charm would be lost on solo travellers or friends this hotel is sexy and intimate and wonderfully sound proofed and cosy we never heard a peep from anyone else and it often felt like we were the only guests good value for money you could spend a lot more money on somewhere with far less character we had read on trip advisor comments about poor service and difficulty finding hotel via uber but had no issues ourselves will be the first place i look to book if back in paris
