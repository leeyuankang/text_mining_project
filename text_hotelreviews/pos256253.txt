excellent property literally floating right on top of the seine river train station across the street and a short walk to the batobus river taxi hop on hop off close to all the major attractions gorgeous hotel room design with an upscale chic ambiance good lounge with wall to wall windows with views up and down the river a word of advice pay the extra and get a river view absolutely fabulous experience
