we live in china so we were really excited when the staff was so kind to us and smiled and helped us with our room and told us where the hairdryer was located we had read the earlier reviews and yes it was a bit chilly but we slept perfectly and we re really impressed by everything we experienced and since we americans aren t your typical entitled yanks we were super polite to the staff and they in return let us enjoy some much needed coffee in the morning no brainer a hotel in the river on a barge in january anywhere in northern europe just might be a bit nippy but that s what travel mates are for so if you re a whiner you might find some things to cry about but sleeping on the seine about a five minute walk from the station and downtown paris is a must on everyone s bucket list about the people who whined about the breakfast any breakfast over euro should be avoided at hotels when you can get great stuff in supermarkets and eat them on the privacy if your own room thanks to the staff for such a wonderful stay and give this place a whirl because you won t regret it
