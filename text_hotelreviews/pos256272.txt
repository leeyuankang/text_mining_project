nice decor different to other hotels i stayed in on the water opposite concrete club so you can just cross the bridge to get there allowed us to do a late check out for free friendly staff they also provided ear plugs for any guest who doesn t venture out in the evening as the bass from the funktion one sound system in concrete crosses the river to the hotel
