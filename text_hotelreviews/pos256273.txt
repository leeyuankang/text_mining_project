the room is plenty of nice little extra s like the lights of which you can change the colour the bed is great also the staff was amazingly friendly we had some misfortune in paris something the hotel had nothing to do with so they had no obligations to help us yet they did everything they could and helped us out in an incredible way not only did they try to find a solution for what we asked but they also thought of little things that could make it a little bit more bearable for us to the staff that was working on the night of the of oktober thank you so much for your kindness again
