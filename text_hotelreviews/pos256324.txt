the d cor was quirky but very nice bathroom was great the receptionist laura was lovely and very helpful a brilliant touch was the smart phone provided in every room you can take it around with you so you can make calls internet apps like citymap which is very useful and all for free a good location close to the louvre and seine plenty of cafes and restaurants close by easy access to the metro i d thoroughly recommend this hotel and will happily go back
