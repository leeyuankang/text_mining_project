i would highly recommend snob while the rooms are fairly small they are beautifully appointed with quality wallpaper and beautiful furnishings probably one of the comfiest beds in all of paris the location is top notch if you want to be close to the main sights this is an ideal spot close to nearby non touristy restaurants but a stone s throw from the pompidou and a minute walk to the louvre etc staff friendly and helpful the whole experience felt like terrific value and i ll stay here again when next in paris
