a fabulous little boutique hotel in a perfect location run by lovely helpful staff the area has seen much gentrification recently and the hotel is a perfect gothic nod to something a little fun location is an easy minute stroll to the louvre minutes from lovely restaurants and great for the metro and rer stations we stayed but one night in a very comfy bed and wish it had been longer we will definitely stay again for our next trip to paris
