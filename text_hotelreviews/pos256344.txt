completely remodeled hotel in the heart of paris walking distance to pretty much everything pompidou marais notre dame breakfast was excellent for french standards the french don t really eat a big breakfast the breakfast area is right at the entrance hallway of the hotel not that many seats so this could get crowded in the mornings in the peak season rooms are small but clean and very comfortable everything you need for a wonderful stay
