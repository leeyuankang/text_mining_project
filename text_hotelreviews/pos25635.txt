the hotel is located right in the trendy shoreditch precinct with many great bars restaurants and cafes only a stone throw away the hotel itself is very modern and great for people watching all the regulars coming in for a beer or bite to eat the music can be a bit loud at night in the downstairs bar but thats the sort of vibe i like
