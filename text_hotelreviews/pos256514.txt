nearest tube station is kensington olympia but this only operates on weekends and some public holidays fortunately we arrived one weekend and departed on the next so could use it on weekdays we used shepherd s bush tube station minutes walk away our room had a kitchenette with frig freezer which allowed us to store food and cook our own meals the staff were very friendly and helpful value was good for london we would stay here again
