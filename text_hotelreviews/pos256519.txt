a decent room but a little on the small side for the price which was too expensive for what you get it is well kitted out but for some strange reason there is nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom we were also in the lower rooms which were underneath the outside path slightly noisier but not too bad would much prefer a higher room in the main house very comfortable beds and the room looks very modern the shower is superb
