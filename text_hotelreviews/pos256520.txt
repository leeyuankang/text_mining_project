nice room bed was a bit small as i m quite tall and lanky and my legs really stuck out the end of the bed nice kitchenette in the room which is a great idea wifi was down when we arrived and we were told it wasn t likely to be working at all during our stay other than that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay
