well i was not sure how to rate this place as there is one big issue they also have rooms in the basement with fake windows that look out on the hall for the same price as the rooms on the standard floors this is a real disgrace to offer basement rooms for over a hundred pounds for such room i wouldn t rate them more than but after my complain they moved me to the room on the second floor so i must rate them based on what i had and the room was very nice everything new modern style clean and with nice small kitchenette also the area around this hotel is pretty nice and in walking distance from metro station and beautiful holland park
