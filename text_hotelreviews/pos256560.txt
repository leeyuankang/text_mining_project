it s a wonderful place to stay right near olympia with great pubs and shops and a park only a street away the room was great the inclusion of sink microwave cooking hob and fridge with toaster kettle everything you could need a tea towel for drying up was the only thing missing but they even provide a safe and slippers so i can t complain at all try the shower too a rain forest shower is wonderful well recommend
