i stayed in london for one night i was disappointed from the hotel and i think it is highly rated by customers at booking com i was given a room in lower ground floor basement i asked to have a room on the floors but the receptionist said that there wasn t another room he was very indifferent and didn t care at all male i have paid british pounds euros for a basement room with bars on the window which smelled humidity it was also very small i had the double studio and was by myself still very very small the bathroom was nice probably the nicest part of the room though a bit small they provided shampoos conditioners and soap very generous with that the kitchenette looked old the furniture and the pan need replacement they had complimentary bottles of water tea and cookies though although i didn t use any bed mattress felt old no space to move around they did have slippers though ironing board and hair dryer my power plug adapters which i ve used in another part of england where i was before didn t make contact in their plugs fortunately my laptop was purchased from amazon and had uk power plug so i charged my phone and ipad through my laptop
