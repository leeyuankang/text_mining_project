i liked the area of kensington and it suited my needs to be in that area there is a corner shop min walk away to obtain stocks of food supplies and its great to have a kitchenette to cook to keep costs down a big plus for me being alone and not wishing to be out at night although the area is very safe it is modern compact and clean i am airline staff and travel a lot a fellow work colleague was there the same time as me unbeknown to me she was with her family so the property is popular with airline travellers
