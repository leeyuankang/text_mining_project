the room was great lovely bathroom plenty of space and very quiet i never feel i get value for money from hotel breakfasts so a studio with kitchenette was great for me and it was a nice surprise to find the kitchenette stocked with complimentary teabags milk etc the location is ideal for olympia conference expo centre and was a reasonable walk from shepherd s bush station so i d use it again if attending events there in future
