its interior was kind of minimal which makes it very nice to look at the room isn t super big but spacious enough for our comfort you don t have to squeeze your way through to go to the toilet the room we slept in had a small kitchen in a cupboard which i think is pretty convenient too the staff was really nice and helpful too and made us feel very welcomed tube station is few minutes away so getting around isn t really that big of a problem for us
