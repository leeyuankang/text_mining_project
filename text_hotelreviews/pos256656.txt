it was clean and spaceouis normally booking in london you never get the same as the pictures but this was accurate the room was spacious especially with two girls and two massive suitcases we had room to spare the facilities was clean tidy and immaculate from the moment we walked in the staff friendly and accommodating simply one of the best places i have ever stayed so much so when we got home we booked straight away for a few weeks time they let us check in early and was ready for us and even after check out held our luggage so we could go shopping before we had to leave i would recommend this hotel to anyone
