overall for price location and privacy i cannot complain about this property although there are some areas for improvement but nowhere is perfect beautiful good sized bathroom good location westfield london mins away by car minus traffic during the day easy to find in a car and clearly signposted clean and tidy reception and decor outside slippers and toiletries provided iron and hair dryer in provided hair dryer didn t work however complimentary water in fridge and tea bags and biscuits ample towels provided maybe too many kitchenette in a cupboard and suitable for a short stay and if you don t plan to cook as i don t fancy standing in between a cupboard to cook however it s nice to have a good sized fridge sink and microwave when away as you don t often get these in hotels small room but there was a single and double bed in my room i would recommend for max adults or an adult and a child of they can make it up and down the stairs price for location was excellent for friday night and booked on the day although i don t think this price drop happens often it s worth looking out for i googled the area before hand and found out the whole borough has controlled parking however permit restrictionss are monday to friday to i parked in a pay and display bay on friday night until on saturday morning at on saturday i topped up the maximum stay of hours h until check our time midday such parking arrangements are quite stressful and expensive so others may wish to book a saturday to sunday stay where permit restrictions are lifted after on saturday so you can park from check in to check out stress free
