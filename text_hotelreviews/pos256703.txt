very clean and modern room as shown on the photos comfortable beds nice and helpful staff when we arrived we first were a bit concerned whether this place would be a bit too much off everything as the neighborhood looked very quiet and we didn t see any restaurants or shops nearby but actually there is a bus stop nearby and buses leave every minutes and you can easily reach several tube stations kensington highstreet for shopping and lot s of nice places to go out for dinner for us it was even walking distance as we like to walk and explore the neighborhood we enjoyed the place very much and it felt like a relief when we came back from buzzling city centre and crowdy tourist attractions and we were glad to stay there the area is clean safe and has a lot of nice houses to look at and as mentioned lot s of places to go out nearby we would stay there again
