we liked the location close to westfield shopping center which means you have many shops and restaurants close buy everything in the hotel is new thus very clean very nice discrete lights in the room we booked two rooms for three adults one of which was a double and the other was a triple studio kind and helpful staff the triple studio had a kitchenette with everything in it a fridge a kettle even a microwave hours reception desk which is very nice
