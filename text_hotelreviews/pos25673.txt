this is a cool hotel that still maintains friendly customer service i had a large room so i m not sure if they all have this but i loved the turntable and collection of retro records to play the room was spacious and comfortable ace hotels can be a bit too cool for school but these guys have kept the warm service i also like their communal spaces
