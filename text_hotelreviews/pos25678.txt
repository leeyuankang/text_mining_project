this was my wedding weekend and when i checked into my room there was a bottle of bubbles and a lovely note from the staff nothing was too much trouble and i really do think that this place is incredible value for money and i would definitely stay again the bed was massive the bathroom spotless and there s a terrific humour surrounding all the facilities which you can t help but smile at
