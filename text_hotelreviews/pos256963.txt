room staff and service was excellent bed and high thread count sheets felt amazing after a long day of sigh seeing shower and deep soaking tub were equally as grand water soft drinks and nespresso provided free of cost was a great bonus the best and most helpful perk was the complimentary smart phone in the room that we were able to use at any time to make calls within the u k and to the usa for free we could also take the phone with us to use as a map and guide to navigate around the city this was incredibly useful would highly recommend this hotel
