really helpful and polite staff lovely room with super comfy bed and soft sheets the hotel only has off street parking which i didn t realise but for us that was fine and they don t serve alcohol this wasn t an issue for us and you could provide your own if you wanted to the mini bar was stocked with lovely soft drinks coffee machine and water all free of charge we asked for a kettle and we re brought tea bags and fresh milk within minutes they d even boiled the kettle for us ready for making the baby milk really thoughtful
