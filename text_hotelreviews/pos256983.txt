this is a beautiful small hotel which is immaculate throughout the room was very comfortable the bathroom perfect this place could be exceptional it just needs something more from the ethos and routines the staff are friendly and efficient but there is not much soul or warmth in the place if the owners could recognise and change this this would be a go to stay for me in london
