great place in a superb location adria is perfectly located in chelsea the neighbourhood is fantastic of course and the hotel is within walking distance to all chelsea south kensington attractions the hotel itself is beautiful the staff helpful and kind i stayed in a relatively small room but it was conveniently arranged and furnished sitting rooms on the ground floor are good for meeting friends or visitors if the space in the room is not enough mine wasn t but the communal areas are still very private and nice i didn t have enough time to use the sauna but it is good to know that one is available
