the property was very cosy and pretty with deep red carpets and personalized room names the staff were lovely and showed me around the facilities and the check in out was super quick and easy the bathroom was beautiful and all marble the bed was super comfortable and there were good movie channels very reasonably priced i stayed in knightsbridge for before at more than double the price and only regret not staying there the whole time
