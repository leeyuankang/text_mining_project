my friend and i arrived in a very tired state after separate red eye flights and were greeted in a very welcoming yet professional manner it was too early to check in but our luggage was collected and we were shown to the dining room where we could partake of the buffet or order breakfast during our week s stay the entire staff was very helpful and most gracious we are coming back
