the hotel was in a really good location and the atmosphere was great we enjoyed exploring the area around the hotel it was just a minute walk from spitalfields mins from old street and liverpool street stations and was surrounded by countless cool eateries and bars all tastes were catered for overall though a great hotel in an ideal location
