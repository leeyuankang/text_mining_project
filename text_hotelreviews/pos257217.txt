the bed was extremely comfortable the staff at the front desk were extremely helpful in giving directions to certain sites and recommending which metro lines to take to get to them they even printed detailed close up maps to ensure we didn t get lost it was quite close to gate du nord station but we had a bit of trouble navigating which direction to walk initially from the station to the hotel mini mart next to hotel super close to metro line poissoineire and walking distance from the lovely sacre couer and montrematre
