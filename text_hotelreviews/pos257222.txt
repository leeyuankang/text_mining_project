very convenient to a shop with a fruit stand where we got food for breakfast right next door and around the corner from a bakery which we also used for breakfast food there was a small refrigerator in the room which made it nice a metro stop was almost right outside the front door of the hotel and we were minutes by car from major train stations there were plenty of different types of restaurants near by to choose from the room was cozy but very comfortable and it was clean the hotel staff was very helpful and accommodating
