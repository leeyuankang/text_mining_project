the fact that the subway station is right next to the hotel is a great plus we didnt really like our stay in paris but the hotel made up for it we always looked forward to going back to our comfy bed the staff are really nice very accommodating and even though we were a bit annoying with trying to get back to the hotel after almost getting lost all the time they were always so patient with us we ended up leaving a tip in the room before we left fantastic service especially from the guy which name i failed to get tall shaved head guy the one who ordered the food for us and deborah thank you you made our first romantic trip memorable room
