the staff were extremely helpful during our stay giving advice and help with places to go and things to see including which restaurants they would recommend at the end of our stay my purse was taken by a pickpocket on the metro system and the staff at the hotel could not do enough to help they offered to call the police and translate for us they offered to contact anyone we needed to contact to stop cards etc considering we had already checked out this was above and beyond our expectations
