the staff was very knowledgeable and very helpful they answered our endless questions with patience i also loved that the hotel is located a few feet away from the subway the room was really small but it looks exactly like the picture there are restaurants close by the breakfast is a little pricey but there is an amazing bakery right around the corner from the hotel it is not a luxury hotel but i am happy i chose faubourg and i would stay there again
