hotel was within easy walking distance to gare du nord train station the room decor was very modern trendy which gave the room a nice upscale feel very trendy the room we were in was a jr suite it was very roomy for the three adults in our party it had one large bed i believe it was a king and a couch sofa bed which was rather comfy the bathroom was quite large due to rainfall shower setup no shower doors while the shower setup was very nice it did leave the surrounding bathroom floor quite wet so some we had to mop it up after each use one of the best features of the hotel was its super close proximity to the poissonniere metro subway stop the stop was literally right outside the hotel door it wasn t a busy stop so people and traffic noise were quite low several nice cafes were in all directions as were a number of convenience stores for wine water snacks etc the front desk staff were very nice helpful we were able to store our luggage after we checked out while we did some final exploring before our train to london a small refrigerator was in the room which was nice to keep water drinks food chilled there was also a coffee machine in the room keurig like but ours did not function well the bath towels were very large and plush but the bed pillows were a bit soft for my taste the hotel did offer breakfast but we thought it was a bit pricey so we did not take advantage of it
