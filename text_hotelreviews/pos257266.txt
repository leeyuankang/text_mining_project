staff were very helpful and friendly hotel located five minute walk from gare du nord it is in a perfect location with a metro just outside the hotel you can find some very nice restaurant just outside the hotel rooms were very small but nicely decorated the bathroom was lovely although the hotel is quite central it was very quite and comfortable
