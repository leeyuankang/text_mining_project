brilliant location for us as visiting the royal brompton hospital which is three minutes walk away staff very pleasant and professional sandwich at lunchtime was very tasty fantastic that there is a small lift for one or two max which helped my husband with mobility issues coffee bar brilliant and complimentary we will return
