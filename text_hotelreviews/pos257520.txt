we really enjoyed staying at sydney house the location is fantastic the v a and the natural history museum are both in easy walking distance and fulham road is full of great shops and places to eat and drink the hotel is lovely very clean staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated worth staying in the top room for the brilliant views of london from the terrace
