fantastic location and a warm welcome from the staff whilst there s a nightclub and busy bar in the hotel it wasn t noticeable once up in the room our room was well kitted out and it was a shame we were only staying one night the exclusive wings horns robe was a great touch all staff were super friendly and it was on check out that the girl recommended we take a look at the local flower market which was well worth the walk
