the staff were lovely our first room was pretty bare bones because i chose the standard least expensive room there were some folks starting their partying early in the afternoon but the hotel immediately offered to change our room to a quieter place and even offered to help us move and we re so nice about it we had already used the room and taken showers the hotel is literally steps from the british museum and fairly close to paddington station where the heathrow express terminates lots of good small restaurants close by
