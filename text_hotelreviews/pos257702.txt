unlike some of the previous comments we found the hotel to be great our room was spick and span the breakfast was more than good every morning and the location was perfect very close to the british museum the employees over all had a great attitude but of course as the day wore on they did to to be expected we were in and out of the hotel all day long and overall had a very nice experience yes i would go back
