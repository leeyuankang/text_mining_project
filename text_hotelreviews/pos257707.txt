delighted with everything about this hotel location was great so close to oxford street tottenham court station soho etc but on a relatively quiet and attractive street lots of cafes and handy corner shops nearby decor was lovely everything was spotlessly clean and staff were super friendly and really helpful free wifi and some nice touches in the room like complimentary water really nice quality toiletries and excellent air conditioning bed and pillows were extremely comfortable overall a brilliant stay excellent value for money
