when we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite which was lovely the reason for travelling was my husbands birthday and when we returned to our room there was a birthday card and a delicious bottle of prosecco on ice we were very impressed with the whole experience and would like to thank all the staff for making our visit most enjoyable
