amazingly comfortable bed great facilities wonderful staff especially joseph mugabo who was particularly helpful and assisted my mother whilst she was waiting for me to arrive location was wonderful too great to have our request for a quiet room honoured there was a party happening throughout the night so we were grateful to be on the floor
