we had a lovely stay in london at the radisson blu great location for our theatre trip and on arrival they even upgraded our room as it was my husbands birthday and left fresh chocolate dipped strawberries in the room for our return in the evening which were such nice gestures and much appreciated the room was very well equipped and spacious and the bed extremely comfortable would happily stay again
