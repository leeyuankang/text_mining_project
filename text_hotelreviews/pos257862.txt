we loved the friendliness of the staff and the hotel in general they were super helpful when i asked to change rooms due to the road noise if ur booking a twin room i think they are all on the road side and unless u are used to heavy traffic and sirens you won t sleep our new room was fabulous quiet and we slept really well in the super comfy bed
