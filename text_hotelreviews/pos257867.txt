we had booked a request for a twin room this was not provided so my friend and i had to share a double bed we were offered single duvets these didn t get provided i had to chase up this offer on our return to the hotel at the reception staff very stressed a double duvet did arrive without a cover on it not acceptable the hotel did explain that when a room is booked via a third party its not always possible to provide rooms that have been specifically requested very disappointing visit we shall not be returning
