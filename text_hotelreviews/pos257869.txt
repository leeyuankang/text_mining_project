i booked this stay for my parents wedding anniversary i contacted the staff beforehand to organise gifts to be set up in their room the staff were so helpful and really made it so easy not only that they made it such a special stay for my parents they had nothing but good words to say about the hotel a hotel can look really nice and be up to a high standard but it s the staff who really make your stay enjoyable and that is what happened here
