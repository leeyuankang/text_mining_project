we booked this hotel because of it s location more than anything pleasantly surprised the staff were welcoming and friendly upon arrival even though we arrived early so our room wasn t ready didn t return until but we all felt safe and comfortable in the hotel and around the area overall visit was fantastic and just what we were looking for on this occasion the rooms were spotless and the bathroom was massive and well looked after too
