one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in no this is not a bargain cost wise but i found it to be worth the price and would definitely stay here again i found the staff to be super friendly and helpful great location easy to get the central london cool vibe nice coffee shop i enjoyed a tasty brunch at the hotel restaurant as well buses nearby and a fairly close walk to underground as well many high quality restaurants in the area i only wish i could have stayed longer
