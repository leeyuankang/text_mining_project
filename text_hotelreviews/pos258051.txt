great location down the block from the british museum and within walking distance to leicster suare and soho very conveniently located also was not happy with the tv movie pay per view selection definitely needed updating also couldn t believe that we needed to pay more money to watch cable channels based on our daily rate we stayed on the exclusive seventh floor which was a business floor bigger rooms and more although the late check out was great together with the daily breakfast which was included in our stay
