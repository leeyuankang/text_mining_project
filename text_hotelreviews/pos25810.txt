this hotel was excellent on every level from the moment we arrived in the taxi the staff were attentive and tended to our every need this was especially important as we were travelling with our month old baby the vibe of the hotel was cool and laid back which really suited us and the room interior had every little detail you could want i can t speak more highly of the whole concept of this hotel we truly had the most fantastic couple of days and could have easily spent it all in our hotel room
