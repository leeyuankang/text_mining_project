the location was perfect i was a woman traveling alone and felt very safe in the neighborhood metro stop close by and convenient lots of great places to eat in the area but the restaurant at the hotel was excellent as a guest at the hotel i was able to make a reservation otherwise there was a long line of diners waiting to get a table the staff was very helpful i would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends
