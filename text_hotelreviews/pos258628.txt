there is nothing to dislike about this hotel the frontage reception area and our room were all spotlessly clean the staff were amazing lovely people and so well informed upon our arrival we were presented with a map and the receptionist pointed out all the local places of interest along with eateries and where to go for public transport the concierge then showed us to our room how wonderful is that we re very well travelled and this is the first time a hotel has made us feel so very welcome we mentioned to our hosts we were in london celebrating our anniversary and they gave us wine and chocolates to enjoy perfect the room itself was a small double and although small it was furnished so well you didn t feel cramped at all air conditioning a bonus fridge microwave both provided along with a safe and some water tea coffee etc we asked for extras a couple of times and this was no issue bathroom was immaculate and spacious lovely overhead shower and bath venture away from the hotel and you ll find some lovely gardens nearby with plenty of choice to eat including some english pubs offering ambience good food and fine ale easily accessible by tube and bus this hotel is really a gem find don t hesitate to book and stay
