the location is superb earls court station is a good hub for district and piccadilly lines also holland park and posh south kensington is at walking distance many bars and restaurants nearby cleaning is good and the staff is very friendly rooms are comfortable but small as nearly all london hotels free fresh fruit and coffee at the reception a big plus for me
