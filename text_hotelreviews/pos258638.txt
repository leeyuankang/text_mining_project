the hotel is near to earls court underground on the piccadilly and district lines so is easy to get to heathrow or into london it was quiet very clean and comfortable the twin room was a little cramped for friends and luggage but we managed ok the bed and pillows were comfortable and the shower over the bath had lots of pressure and hot water although it was difficult not to get the bathroom wet as the shower screen was tiny there was a kettle fridge and a microwave but no crockery or cutlery except for cups and teaspoons the wifi worked well and there is a lift the staff were all lovely and very helpful i will return here when next in london
