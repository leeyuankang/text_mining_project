absolutely loved the small boutique feel of the property staff was excellent and so helpful the bonus was the extras such as fresh fruit juices snacks and water at no cost didn t need to run to a local supermarket to get any of these things especially water as they were re stocked every day also no problem to ask for more bottles water etc if you needed it as we left each morning i would ask for a few bottles of water to take with me on our daily excursions wifi was outstanding and fast never had a problem with it and was never bounced out didn t need to reconnect like other hotels in spain the final bonus was the use of a free mobile smartphone to make any calls and use it for goggle maps well done and i highly recommend this property if i return to london i would definitely stay there without hesitation of the hotels i stayed in europe this was my favourite
