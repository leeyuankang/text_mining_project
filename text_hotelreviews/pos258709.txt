good location walking distance from the station staff was very good especially the young lady room was very small the bed even smaller there is some problem with the pictures of the room on booking com and the actual room discussed this with the lady staff who claimed to have herself put the pictures on booking com while she was extremely helpful and i give her the benefit of doubt the actual room is much smaller and pictures were of a higher category room
