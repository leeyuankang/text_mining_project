the staff went out of their way to make my stay a great one from making suggestions of things to do to mapping out directions to going out to get me a cappuccino when the coffee machine had a temporary glitch they were absolutely lovely the room was spotless with brand new fixtures in the bathroom it was very quiet at night i slept like a baby one block from earl s court tube station so very easy to get around microwave and small fridge in the room for those who don t want to eat out for every meal
