the hotel is very close to arc de triomphe minutes by walk there is a market nearby and ternes metro station is minutes far from the hotel although the hotel is in city centre this is located in a little yard so we could enjoy silence too the staff was helpful and cleaning ladies came everyday the wifi connection was good but is needed to spell out in all rooms
