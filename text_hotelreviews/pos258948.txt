we love paris and love this area the location of the hotel was perfect we would recommend it for those wishing to discover paris with limited time near two metros lines and easy to get to from the gard du nord eurostar the staff were excellent very attentive esp as our room was not ready and we waited minutes breakfast was ample with plenty of choice the catering staff very accommodating and cheerful they were working in rather limited space we will definite go back as location and ambience was spot on
