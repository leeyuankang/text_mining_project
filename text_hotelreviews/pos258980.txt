really good location helpful staff breakfast was fine for what i wanted and the sauna and gym in the basement you could use if you asked staff they would open for you and put the sauna on mins before you wanted to use it room was lovely and how most rooms are over a secluded garden meant there was barely any city noise other than a few sirens the room was a good size with everything you would need for a trip loved the window seat nice comfy bed bath was great and all the bathroom facilities room included a hairdryer and slippers and minibar the room was clean and i had enough towels for people which was nice as i was using the room alone staff were incredibly friendly and helpful not only about the hotel but also restaurant recommendations and informing about how to get around the city would definitely stay here again
