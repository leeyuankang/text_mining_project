the room had windows that look like small holes in a box but the staff and the comfort of the room bathroom and the rest of the hotel made me forget that discomfort i especially liked the staff that is really customer service oriented from now on this will be my hotel in paris as good customer service in paris is extremely rare keep it up a smile goes a long way
