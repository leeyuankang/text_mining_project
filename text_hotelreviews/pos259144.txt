this was our fifth wedding anniversary so wanted something special the hotel didn t dissapoint in the slightest only months old it was in superb condition with all the mod cons you d expect in star got a great day rate and a free upgrade in a duplex apartment would highly recommend was about mins walk to opera house where you can catch the bus to the airport and about another mins walk to the seine so great position overall
