hotel cristal was a perfect location we stayed with our children ages it was great for a few nights with them but since this a boutique hotel i wouldn t necessarily recommend for younger kids or longer term than a weekend with kids the staff was very accommodating super helpful the hotel overall was clean if you want a quiet room request a room not located on the street side
