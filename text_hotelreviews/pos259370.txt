location was my favourite are of paris the latin quarter just close to boulevard saint michel and saint german des pres great place to start and end every day for a paris romantic but for other travellers also excellent for metro location and sight seeing in general near notre dame and the seine staff lovely special credit to the young lady who welcomed us on our first day
