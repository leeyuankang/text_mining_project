loved this hotel very friendly and helpful at the front desk the housekeepers were friendly and attentive our room happened to be a larger than typical parisian hotel room and it was amazingly quiet it might have been a deluxe room it was on a very quiet street i passed on the breakfast preferring my morning eggs at a local brasserie the location was great minute walk to notre dame but plenty far enough from the tourist mobs a minute from the metro
