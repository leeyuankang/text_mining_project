loved the cool and super friendly staff and the relaxed environment of the hotel true parisian experience specially if you prefer small hotels with personality take your time and enjoy some food and drinks in the restaurant while you mingle with the locals great details in the room totally connected with the area and the neighborhood location is also very good walking distance to the pretty streets of montmartre
