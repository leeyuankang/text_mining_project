all of the staff were amazing friendly and very helpful with securing museum passes helping us with train booking and general information the hotel was so conveniently located block from the seine right across from the ile de la cite on the left bank we could walk to everything if you didn t want to walk the metro stop was a half block away there were copies of the international nytimes in the lobby every day the vieux paris is a small more personal hotel which is what we like i would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in paris and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again myself
