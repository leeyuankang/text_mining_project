this is a great little hotel we stayed there may this year and will stay there again the next time we are in paris staff is very helpful and speaks english they have tickets to the major museums at a small premium which eliminates need to stand in at least one line our room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was modern and hotel and location are quiet but best aspect is fabulous location only one block from the place st michel in the heart of the left bank easy walking distance to most of the major sights and very close to metro
