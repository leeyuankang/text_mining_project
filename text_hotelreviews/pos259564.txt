this small hotel is full of character ask for the book about it s history rooms are small but have everything you need the shower even had jacuzzi jets the hotel is just south of the river from notre dame it is convenient to the metro however much of paris is within walking distance the nearby street st andre des artes has almost every choice of eating places you can imagine the manager and his staff did everything they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay
