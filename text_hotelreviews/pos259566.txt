the staff were very friendly and always willing to help us advising us of places to visit and assisting with travel arrangements the local area is lovely with lots of cafes restaurants and shops the river notre dame and a tube station a few minutes walk away we visited all the main attractions using the metro we never travelled for more than minutes so this is an ideal location the room was small but fine for the two of us and had always been cleaned when we got back in the evening
