the staff were delightful and spoke slow french so i could understand they were overly helpful and even upgraded us the location is perfect the seine to one side and the small cobble locked streets of st michel to the other the decor was beautiful relaxed like an old wooden cottage in the middle of nowhere incredible home in the middle of paris
