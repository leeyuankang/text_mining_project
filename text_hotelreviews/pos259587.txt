fantastic location near notre dame yet tucked away in a quiet street very characterful and cosy hotel but note the lift is tiny and the staircase is a tiny spiral staircase so not really suitable for disabled access particularly in case of fire bathroom very well appointed but compact and again it would be difficult to climb into the shower if mobility restricted
