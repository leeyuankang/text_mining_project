the staff was really helpful despite our lack of speaking french this hotel was centrally located and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see though we did use the metro because of its convenience the b line goes straight to a stop close to the hotel from the airport and it was easy to use make sure you get the right b train on the way back to the airport by using the overhead monitor i read where a client thought the room was too small for a city this size and from growing up in ny the room was a little larger than i expected i would highly recommend this hotel it was very cute and the room well appointed and close to notre dame and several cafes
