beautifully renovated boutique hotel staff were amazing and always friendly room was generous with modern decor and a great bed the bathroom was small but met all our needs and besides this is city centre so to be expected this was in the perfect location to explore hotel is still in its first year and i sure they will have many return visitors i highly recommend this hotel
