every single member of staff was helpful and friendly the hotel was quiet but we liked that everything was clean and well kept the beds and pillows were wonderfully comfortable there was a bar although it was so quiet that you sometimes had to go to reception to ask someone to come and serve but they always did straight away close to restaurants and cafes but also easy access to the metro we loved it and i would happily go back more than lived up to expectations
