loved the hotel so beautiful the staff was very helpful and the hotel was super clean the location was nice and quiet and pretty centrally located a metro station is about blocks west and gets you to the eiffel tower in mins including walking you can see the eiffel tower as you stroll around the neighborhood and there is a lovely bakery down the street limited hours and a convenance store we also spent some time at the cafe basile about three blocks loved it too
