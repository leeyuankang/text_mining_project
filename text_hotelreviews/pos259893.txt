on thursdays there is a local farmers market in the street near the hotel amazing the location is easy to get anywhere and near a major shopping street that is much more authentic than the tourist areas i love this hotel the breakfasts are also really good it s a great place to have a walk in a paris suburb that is not simply a tourist destination although obviously this is an area of paris not easily afforded
