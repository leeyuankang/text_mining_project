on arrival we got upgraded to a junior suite which was very spacious and very modern biggest room we ever had for a paris hotel we had great view of the city and eiffel tower the location was fantastic very close to everything great area for food and restaurants and tucked away in a quiet little street will definitely be back and stay at this hotel again very helpful staff also
