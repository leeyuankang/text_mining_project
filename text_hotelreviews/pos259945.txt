location near to paddington and opposite hyde park beautiful walks and runs in the park and very close to the italian fountain grden and the serpentine gallery outside tables and chairs were a nice bonus especially since the it was very little ambiance or atmosphere inside the hotel bar staff were friendly felt sorry for the woman who was managing front desk as she had to juggle phones check ins and check outs without enough support
