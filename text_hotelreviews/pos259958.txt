when we arrived early the reception staff member was incredibly kind and very welcoming he gave us a room straight away at no extra cost after he learnt that the previous night we had had no sleep he was professional but also very warm including my child in a conversation the room was great though my only issue was it was too warm because they run the heater as a whole however a staff member came up to open a window straight away breakfast was fresh and plentiful we were given a room facing hyde park which was fantastic as we were across the road for a twin room in london it was double the size and the beds were very comfortable min walk from queensway station we would return to this hotel
