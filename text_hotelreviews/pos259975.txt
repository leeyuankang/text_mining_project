unfortunately the toilet in our room didn t flush the shower dropped continuously through the night the generator was very noisy right outside our room the bed was up against the wall which meant you had to crawl out of the end if you needed to get out in the night very hard we appreciate that this an old building but surely that is no excuse for old plumbing
