overall experience was excellent staff is very kind and helpful hotel is clean location is excellent very near to most touristic locations wifi was perfect although the hotel is in a noisy area sound isolation is good and when windows are closed the noise level is not disturbing this is my second stay in this hotel and i had a superior room this time compared to standard room i had previously superior room has just enough space for comfortable movement around the room
