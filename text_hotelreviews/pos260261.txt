the location is very good the metro is very close just a few meters away we were on the first floor on our first night which was not a very good room it was a bit noisy from the sounds on the streets and there was some noise in the room probably from the ac or something we moved to the floor the next day which is much better more quiet without the noise the staff was nice the breakfast was very good plenty of choices i would stay here again should i go back to paris
