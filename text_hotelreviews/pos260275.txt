the staffs were friendly and helpful free car park for the guests they even gave us extended parking time until afternoon the breakfast was varied and tasteful the hotel is located nicely near metro station with plenty of restaurants nearby plus it is situation in convenient and quiet neighbourhood but yet still not far from tourist attractions
