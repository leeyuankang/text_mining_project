staff staff staff they were all excellent very professional and very friendly as well the hotel is close to jardin du luxembourg and very close to metro lines it s a little bit farther from the river than a tourist might like but this has the advantage of the area being less full of tourists and more french the cafe around the corner l horizon is also excellent with friendly staff and quality food not really cheap though you don t have to walk far to have your coffee and croissant in the morning sun
