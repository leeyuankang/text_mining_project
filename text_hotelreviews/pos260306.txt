location is great close to metro excellent brasseries shopping centre and montparnasse all staff were extremely friendly welcoming and helpful room spacious clean and had all facilities fridge mini bar safe comfy bed toiletries ect great wifi one staff member paul i think was most helpful when we enquired about a laundromat laverie he took time to explain where it was and even offered to walk there with us the place he recommended was just down the street and was money well spent
