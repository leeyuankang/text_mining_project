i don t even know where to start to describe our amazing experience at the belle juliette first of we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a romantic room which was absolutely divine the facilities in the room were excellent from the imac to the nespresso coffee maker as for cleanliness i cannot praise the staff enough in fact believe it or not there s been days we had the room cleaned twice without requesting it the spa facilities were also fantastic it almost felt as if they were exclusively made available for us as at no time did we see other guests if you want you can even arrange a massage which is about euro per hour the breakfast was also plentiful delicious and yammy including the coffee i normally hate hotel coffee and lastly the front desk and f b staff have been wonderful special praises to lola and louis overall it s been an amazing stay and by all means intend to return sometimes soon
