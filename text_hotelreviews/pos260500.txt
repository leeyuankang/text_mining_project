the location of the hotel is not bad it was a neighborhood we wanted to be located in however it may not be ideal for all travellers as proximity to some of the more touristy areas airport transfers are not the easiest the hotel is said to have a transfer service though which may be appealing to some travellers we did not use it it seems like this is a newer hotel which was a plus for us it was mostly modern and clean wifi worked without disruptions
