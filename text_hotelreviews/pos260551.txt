great location and very nice comfortable family and couple hotel we had requested an early check in the hotel emailed us and told us that they will try their best arrived at the hotel by am after a long and tiresome flight and found the hotel to be fully booked the reception staff asked us to wait a while and did indicate and apologise for the inconvenience as check in usual time in pm by am our room was ready to move into which was not very late as we only had to wait and a half hour in the comfortable and well decorated lobby a complimentary tea or coffee for the waiting guests would have been nice and would have made us really appreciate the service from the hotel and would show that they really cared nonetheless the room was very clean and comfortable as well as the bathroom however while taking the shower the bath tub drain was closed and stuck so had to call the housekeeping and very promptly they came and fixed it in minutes the breakfast was well served and up to the mark would definitely come back and stay here
