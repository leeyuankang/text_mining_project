the accommodation was good clean with great air conditioning accepted a room at the front of the hotel we were a little worried about the noise from the road at first but actually didn t hear a thing first rate staff with a very jolly front of house meeting us for breakfast which was equally as good the hotel was perfectly placed for our excursions on foot which took us to the theatre shopping on oxford st and several restaurants all within an easy walk great would definitely go back again
