i stayed nights in the doubletree hilton hotel i was in london for bussiness and loved this location it was nearby the british museum and only a minute walk away from oxford street subway is also closeby holborn i enjoyed my stay here so much the ladies at the reception where lovely even when i had some troubles checking in they helped me and where really helpful with everything for the room it is small but for one person big enough bed was comfy and breakfast super extensive next time i will book this hotel again
