the breakfast was lovely really enjoyed and buffet style too so you could get what you wanted we had a couple of drinks in the bar area which was really lovely and comfortable the staff were really friendly and helpful really close to the tube and on the piccadilly line so it was only a couple of stops before you are right in the heart of covent garden we picked this on purpose as we were going to see a show as part of our trip
