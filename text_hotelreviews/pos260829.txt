the staff were very helpful friendly and professional at all times response to requests for assistance were immediate breakfast buffet was exceptional in very way food in the restaurant was also exceptional our room was remarkably quiet and although we could have wished for a wee bit more space in our room we know that hotel rooms in big cities are usually very compact we also loved the central location of this hotel we were ideally situated for the buses and or taking the tube and steps away from a number of fabulous pubs and restaurants a lovely park and even a few major landmarks and museums
