with so much to do in london we ran out of time so were very happy to discover that when we returned to the hotel at around we were still able to dine in the bar there was a good choice on the menu our food arrived quickly and we enjoyed it very much following a great night s sleep breakfast was of the highest standard with a range and quality of food that would be hard to beat staff in all departments were most welcoming and helpful ideally situated between king s cross and covent garden this is a hotel that we have visited before and would not hesitate to do so again
