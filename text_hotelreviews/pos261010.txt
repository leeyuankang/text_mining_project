the hotel was in a perfect location for us loads to do see and great location for plenty of bars restaurants tube station was minutes away the hotel itself provided a very seemless check in the doubletree cookie on arrival the room was clean tidy with ample space and a humongous bed we had problems with not enough towels room being cleaned and also there was no draft beer due to problems otherwise it would have been better rating breakfast was very nice
