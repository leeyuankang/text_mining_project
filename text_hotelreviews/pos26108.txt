very good experience comfortable room friendly staff short walk from vauxhall station and the river breakfast included plenty of choice and was open for hours each morning everything was clean tidy well maintained we arrived early on day and the staff arranged for our room to be made up straight away aircon worked well we didn t really use the kitchen area but it was nice to have a fridge bathroom very spacious would stay again would recommend to others
