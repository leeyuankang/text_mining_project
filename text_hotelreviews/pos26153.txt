amazing hotel not sure where to even start there s the free breakfast which changes daily meaning never bored hour filtered water coffee and tea then there s the laundry and gym amazing room with fantastic bathroom a short walk from vauxhall metro there s not much in the surrounds of vauxhall though do recommend the rose a cute little pub around the corner from the hotel if you re up for a walk head to the river thames and in mins you can be outside big ben westminster abbey and the london eye perfect spot for us not too touristy but easily accessible to all the main attractions either on foot or metro
