hotel d orsay is in a very convenient location a quiet street just a half block from the seine it s easy walking distance to the louvre place de la concorde and the heart of st germain as well as to several metro stations the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming each time we came back to the hotel it was like coming home our room was also a good size bigger than what i had expected for paris it was nicely and comfortably furnished in a homey way you will definitely not feel like you re in a chain hotel here overall we had an excellent stay and would definitely come back next time we re in paris
