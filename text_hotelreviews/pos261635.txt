the staff at hotel d orsay were very welcoming kind considerate and helpful i choose a hotel by the size cleanliness and quality of the bathrooms and in this hotel they were superb large bathtub with a nice shower two sinks full length mirror clean white ties and marble floor if you re european and expect a bidet my room did not have one but i think most americans do not expect a bidet the windows opened put into a beautiful square solarium type garden which was quite beautiful the heating system worked perfectly so you could be warm all through the night when you sleep i especially liked all the antique furniture and real paintings on the wall great usb chargers in the bedside night lamps so you only need to bring the cord without the plug i was near the elevator but never actually heard so the room was peaceful and quiet although it was nice to hear the birds in the morning breakfast had very healthy choices and i love the fact that they had s diner delivery service from i be uneven a nearby restaurant the neighborhood is safe and well lighted and minutes from musee d orsay and othe interesting sites i would definitely say there again i arrived to the hotel by public transportation which cost plus the visit of a subway ticket and then it was a short mi use walk to the hotel when i left i you d the airport shutle taxi for to cdg just see above ground how far away the airport was with no traffic it s minute with intense traffic it takes hour minutes
