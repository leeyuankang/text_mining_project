staff were amazing so genuinely helpful and well mannered could not do enough for you the excellent location was well worth the price public transport an easy walk away we made it from the airport with ease apart from the steps we had to climb with baggage and traveled to disneyland as well we had a family room for adults and old child it was plenty spacious small fridge and tea coffee setup and biscuits were welcome extras highly recommended to all a
