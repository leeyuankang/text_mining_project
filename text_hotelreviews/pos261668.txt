great location and friendly staff the junior suite room was lovely and a great size for our family of adults and seven year olds musee d orsay metro station and the museum itself are a couple of minutes walk away the metro line takes you to the tower eiffel and notre dame within a couple of stops or less it was easy taking a metro to gare du nord one stop to notre dame change line and then about stops to gare du nord we would have done this if the hotel had not advised us to order a more costly car transfer service instead of taking the metro there are some lovely bistros within walking distance it is also walking distance to central sites like the louvre
