a great cozy hotel right next to the d orsay museum opposite the tuileries garden yet the quartier is quite and authentic with almost no tourists at all the room was a little bit small but had great bathroom and all the facilities even a book on a night table to read some pages before you fall asleep fantastic staff and truly parisian atmosphere i enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel would love to stay again
