the staff were super friendly and helpful and they didn t mind listening to my poorly spoken french they were gracious there was a lift to our floor the location was perfect a stroll to the place de concorde and the champs elysee and almost next to the musee d orsay the mini bar was awesome for a catchup with other family also staying in the hotel they had a shuttle service from the airport breakfast was absolutely delicious the room was modern and shower absolutely the best of our week trip better than the sofitel in london
