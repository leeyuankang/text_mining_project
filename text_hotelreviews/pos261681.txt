this hotel is wonderfully positioned to explore paris but feels secluded and tucked away the room and bathroom were well decorated with sumptuous curtains to aid a good night s sleep the towels bathrobes and toiletries were good quality staff were very genuine and could not have been more friendly or helpful i will definitely be returning
