this was an amazing hotel that i would absolutely book at again i looked at hundreds of hotels and i m so glad we booked this one the staff was probably the nicest i ve ever met their dog is super cute breakfast was fabulous and the location perfect the room was very comfortable and well appointed and even roomy by both uk and city standards although it isn t a highend brand name well known hotel it certainly held its own the lobby is so cozy that you almost want to go sit down there and read simple things like the still and sparkling water on tap in the lobby area as well as coffee and tea give it a very nice and welcoming vibe it s on the other side of the bridge and down the river from big ben a good minute walk however the vauxhall tube stop is a short minute walk away and then only two stops to the district and circle lines so you were far away enough from the tourists without being way outside of the city there is a great little pub just feet away and a big tescos grocery store down the street maybe a minute walk i would absolutely book here again and i encourage you to try it out
