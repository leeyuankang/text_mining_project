the hotel had some quirky decor and the staff were friendly and helpful staff also lent us a travel adaptor plug as we had forgotten ours and after stupidly leaving my passport in the safe when we changed hotels they were more than happy to retrieve it and keep it safe for me until i had chance to go back the hotel was close to many attractions and very close to a metro station also this was a bonus although everywhere in paris is quite easily accessible via foot or metro
