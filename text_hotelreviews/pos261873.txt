the hotel has a great location that is near to a great choice of bars and restaurants it is situated close to a metro station that makes travelling to other paris attractions very easy we stayed in a privilege room which could not be described as a large room but was very clean and had everything that we needed for our short stay in paris staff were friendly and the breakfast was good
