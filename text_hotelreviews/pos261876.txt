clean comfortable room perhaps small tight getting around the bed from the window but didn t mind as room looked newly renovated and modern relatively big bathroom with modern updated fixtures twin beds are pretty close together but seems twin rooms are commonly setup like this in paris beds were comfy free wifi was great had no connection issues complimentary bottle of water offered which is a nice surprise double glass windows had street side room and was pretty quiet on floor
