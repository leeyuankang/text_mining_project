we chose a privilege room because we wanted the extra space paris hotel rooms are small compared to australian standards the hotel room and its facilities were clean comfortable and modern in furnishings and fittings the staff were friendly and helpful we had a short stay in paris two nights and wanted to be close to the shopping district and the louvre so this hotel in the grande boulevard area suited our purposes perfectly
