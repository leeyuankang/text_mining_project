the hotel is in very good condition and is modern clean the king size bed superior room was comfortable and the en suite was excellent and spacious however the space around the bed was just adequate i searched for a while reading multiple reviews before booking this hotel and for the price vs standard of the hotel there isn t much better however if i visit paris again i think i would sacrifice hotel quality for a better location walking distance from main attractions for the same price overall i would score this hotel
