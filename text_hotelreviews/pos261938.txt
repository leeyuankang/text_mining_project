this is a fantastic place to stay in paris in fact it s the best hotel i have stayed in so far in paris and i have been here many times spotlessly clean room comfortable bed and very quiet friendly staff this place is great when you have a conference in palais de congres but also close to arc de triomph public transport will bring you anywhere from here for great italian dinner go to la casa di sergio just down the road at avenue des ternes airport bus from cdg stops just around the corner
