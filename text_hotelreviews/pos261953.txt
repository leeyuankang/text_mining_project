the location was so convenient walking distance from arc de triumph convenient supermarket right in front of the hotel loved the decorations both in the lobby and in the room although the room was a little tight and we had no room for our luggage the staff were very helpful they informed us about the airport shuttle which took us directly to the charles de gaule airport and the stop was only a couple of minutes away would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone
