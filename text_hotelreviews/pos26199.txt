the apartments are new and very clean the whole place has a modern feel to it all of the staff were very courteous and helpful but almena was a star so friendly and personable i like the very large spaces downstairs comfortable and peaceful the breakfast was very good no bacon though and represents excellent value whilst reading the free newspapers free tea and coffee hours is also a lovely and unique touch having a pantry of essentials is also a good idea my only small gripe would be the lack of natural light in my particular room
