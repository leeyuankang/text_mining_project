on my reservation i clearly stated we had wheelchair guest however upon arrival at your kensington hotel your staff insisted i did not inform them of this request i then asked about parking and again stating we had one person in a wheelchair i was directed to park in the underground car park we then parked my car and got my son and his wheelchair out of the car only to find that there was no exit from the car park except up some steep and narrow stairs after walking around for around ten minutes to try to find a way out i ended up having to press a button on the car park ticket machine for assistance minutes later a member of staff from the hotel came down and tried to say that it was our fault for parking in the car park the same lady when we reached to lobby of the hotel was very abrupt in insisting that i point out the member of staff that booked us in to the point the concierge had to come over and tell her to leave it and if this was not bad enough we then get to our room only to find that the wheelchair could not get through the door he also was not able to use the bathroom as it was impossible to turn the wheelchair to get in i went to reception and was told there was a disabled toilet on the mesanine floor and there was only one lift that could access it i tried for ten minutes to get access to this lift but had no success in the end the concierge had to go up and bring the lift down to us each time he wanted to use the toilet i have travelled to most parts of this world both with my son and on my own for my work and this was the worst and most embarrassing experience i have ever had the misfortune of being involved in especially for my year old son
