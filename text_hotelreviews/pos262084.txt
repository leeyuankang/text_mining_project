the location of the hotel is great and the staff very helpful friendly and professional like most traveller s you do not spend a lot of time in the hotel as you are always out and about but it is so nice to have somewhere clean comfortable and welcoming to come back to the bed s are really comfortable all facilities working perfectly and it was nice to have a fridge in the room to keep your water and maybe a little fizz cool
