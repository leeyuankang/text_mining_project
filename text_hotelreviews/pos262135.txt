the bathroom was tired sink had large crack and tiles round bath were discoloured and looked quite grotty beds were soft uncomfortable for us but some may like this breakfast was excellent with hot and cold choice great staff who were in attendance for all your needs extra tea coffee etc we asked for a room with a nice view over london and our request was granted rooms are small concierge was helpful as were the reception staff left luggage facility location is the best thing about this hotel minutes walk from gloucester rd tube plenty shops nearby and the hereford arms is a great pub for dinner drinks twice
