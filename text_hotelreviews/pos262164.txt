the breakfast was wonderful the scrambled eggs were fresh and fluffy hot foods were hot and everything was well presented it left the previous hotel for dead and we had club level accomodation there the dining area was very clean and attractive food was continually being replenished the night housekeeping staff were very good and gave me a large duvet when i complained about being cold i am a senior and i really feel the cold we did ask for a quiet room and although we were on a lower floor we had been put in a room which overlooked a small garden which screened us from the traffic quite a lot
