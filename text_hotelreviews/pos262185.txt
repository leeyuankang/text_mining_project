this is a comfortable hotel very close to gloucester road tube station and consequently well connected to the piccadilly and circle lines we went to different theatres concert halls and museums with no hassle at all there are good restaurants locally and in central london if you choose not to eat at the hotel the hotel is also an easy walk to the river and in the opposite direction to holland park museums are either close by walking or by tube the breakfast room is large but the buffet works well there is a small shop restaurant and starbucks on the ground floor there is a business lounge that we had access to and this made a nice place for a break and a snack supplied by the hotel the atmosphere at the hotel is very good and the staff are very helpful one can leave bags in a secure area on the day of departure
