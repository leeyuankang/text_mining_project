standard check in time was already good at on arrival around our room was ready so we could settle in and then make the most of our short stay in london when i realised it was a very large hotel i wondered if there would be delays and possibly poor service at breakfast when we went down on saturday that was definitely not the case we were shown to a table immediately the buffets were well stocked the hot food was fresh and hot no complaints at all we did notice a plate of pastries and muffins where the queue would have been if there was one so they were prepared
