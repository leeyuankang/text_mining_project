the room was clean and comfortable and as expected from a holiday inn the ironing facilities in our room rather than having to go to ask for one or visit an ironing room as is the case at some other chain hotels was a bonus too i was also impressed with the amount of lifts and lack of waiting time for them we visited for an event at the albert hall and the proximity to this and the tube station were great should i need to stay in this part of london again i would definitely use the hotel again
