the location of the hotel is excellent especially if you are visiting the nearby museums and shops in knightsbridge the staff are friendly and attentive and the adjacent car park is a great asset although we didn t eat in the hotel the menu looked good with plenty of choice because we booked executive rooms we were able to use the executive suite this is a great asset to your stay and needs to be used through out the day to get its benifit
