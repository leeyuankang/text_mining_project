liked the fact the windows open for fresh air rather than just aircon only staff were very helpful and location for a function close by made it a perfect choice for me it was also around the corner from the tube station and lots of restaurants all around and fast food coffee like mcdonalds kfc tesco etc so you can eat on any budget
