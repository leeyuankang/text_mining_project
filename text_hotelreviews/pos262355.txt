the location is perfect close to tube station and large grocery store the twin room was large by comparison to other hotels in the same area still a little cramped for two but manageable the staff was warm and courteous and room service supplied us with top sheets for the beds many english hotels only have duvets on the beds uncomfortable in the summer
