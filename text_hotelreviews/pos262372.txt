this is a decent hotel and good value at the rate we paid we liked the area which is far less crowded than where we had been in covent garden very close to a tube station on the piccadilly line and walking distance to several lovely museums and direct airport access to terminal needed more front desk staff as there was a very long line up at check in but at least allowed us to leave the luggage and check in later as we had a matinee to attend
