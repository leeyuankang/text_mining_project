excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean suite for just over staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the indian food in the bar smelt delicious room service was very reasonably priced too
