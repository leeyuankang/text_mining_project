the location is great and very convenient right next to the gloucester rd tube station and walking distance from the museums the staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was spacious and very clean we had an issue with getting a room with two single beds instead of one double bed as we requested via booking but it was taken care of rather quickly with the staff even moving our luggage themselves from the old room to the new overall it is quiet despite being located on a busy road highly recommended and will definitely visit again
