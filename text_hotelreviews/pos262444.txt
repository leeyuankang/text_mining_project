the hotel is in a great location close to the gloucester road tube station we had a decent sized double room as staff at reception was considerate enough to take into account that we had our son with us the bed was comfortable and i like that the pillows come in a combination of a soft firm pillows to suit your preference the staff were very helpful and friendly throughout the room came with breakfast which provided quite a good spread
