the location is absolute perfection the direct route from gloucester road station to heathrow via the picadilly line makes for a very easy commute even during rush hour the neighborhood is very pleasant and nice offering multiple options for dining the umami restaurant on cromwell road serves quite good pan asian fare we warmly recommend the tempura lychee
