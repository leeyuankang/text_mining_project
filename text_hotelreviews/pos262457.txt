the staff was very friendly and helpful with our questions since this was our first london visit the location is excellent close to restaurants stores tube buses banks the breakfast buffet was plentiful and good small charge for breakfast but worth it the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean received an upgraded room to the floor wonderful view complimentary bottles of water and a candy bar was left in our room everyday would stay here again on a return visit
