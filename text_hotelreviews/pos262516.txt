the breakfast is fantastic everything you could possibly wish for they also know how to cook a dippy fried egg and my partner was absolutely thrilled about that it made his weekend ha i stay here regularly on business but it was my partners first trip down and he agreed that it was a great place to base ourselves for the weekend not in the thick of it so we were able to get away from the crowds but also very easy access to all the attractions such as the sea life centre london dungeon london eye etc
