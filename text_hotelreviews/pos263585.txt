the staff consistently went above and beyond in their service we arrived at reception on a hot day after many hours of travel and were immediately offered ice cold watermelon flavoured water our request for a late check out was willingly accommodated and we were able to checkout at at no extra charge the concierge was very knowledgeable about transport in and around london saving us considerable time the option to avoid unnecessary changing of sheets and towels during short stays to minimise the environmental impact was a great initiative the offer to date money to a charity for every day this option was exercised was an added plus hats off the blu radisson for this environmentally friendly initiative
