breakfast is always great the rooms are comfortable and this time i stayed at the front of the hotel which was much better some rooms seem small but i guess that s london the location is good and staff always found a taxi for me when needed the gym is small but ok for a short trip i like the idea of the grab and go breakfast when you need to leave early although opening the dining room a little earlier would help i had room service which was also good for a business trip i can t really fault it
