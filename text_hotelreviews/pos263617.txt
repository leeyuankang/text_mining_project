the service is amazing every staff member goes really out of their way to make your stay incredibly smooth i loved it i would always come back to the room to find small gestures by the housekeeping that makes you feel more at home rather than a hotel even my taxi got late so the concierge volunteered to take me to the station in his own car which was extremely kind i definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again
