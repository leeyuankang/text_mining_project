the scoff and banter took ages to make our irish coffees and the waitress didn t know what it was so we said bring us coffee and whiskies and we ll pour it in the man in charge of the bar couldnt find the jamiesons whisky which my husband had asked for to go in it then they got it wrong and although i said white coffee for me and black for my husband we both got black they did apologise but it looked as if nobody really knew what they were doing there was also an awful repetitive head banging music in thw background which was too loud it was also piped in the foyer of the hotel i told to the waitress how we had to get away from it and she agreed it was awful seating was lovely and comfortable though and the whole room looked stunning our bed pillows were solo comfortable that i want to buy some does anybody know which shop i can get them in please
