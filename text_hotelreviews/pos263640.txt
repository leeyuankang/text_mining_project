location is perfect close to oxford street soho leicester square piccadilly circus yet in a quiet neighborhood you can actually sleep with the window open without waking up because of traffic breakfast is awesome with a variety of things to choose from and everything prepared with utmost care and quality the single superior room is worth the extra money though small the bigger bed makes the stay more comfortable coffee tea and water are complimentary which is appreciated staff was helpful and accommodating in every aspect
