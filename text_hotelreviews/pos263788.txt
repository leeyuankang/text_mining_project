initially i was given a smaller room than booked when this was mentioned i was moved to another room but the tv was faulty when i told staff they moved immediately to respond when the problem needed further work i was moved again and i think upgraded because the room was lovely staff always helpful welcoming and pleasant rooms very clean and tidy and beds very comfy thankyou for a great stay in london
