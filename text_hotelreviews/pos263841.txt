the location was good close to shopping and the tube the breakfast buffet was included in the price the food was well stocked and fresh but there was only one slice toaster so you had to make your toast first or you did not get any or would be done your meal by the time you got your toast the staff was good but on the last day i was there until the buffet ended they didn t even give me a few extra minutes to finish the meal before they started vacuuming around me
