when looking for a great hotel near covent garden and theatres my best friend and me found this gem of a hotel as it seemed just perfect for us and it didn t disappoint very professional staff greetings were all friendly from reception to dining to bar from the moment we checked in until we left our room was spacious the beds very comfy the furnishings were clean not worn looking and everything was extremely comfortable despite the room being street side with double windows equipped we encountered no noise distraction whatsoever the hotel is placed in an excellent spot in the heart of westend within walking distance to everything it s barely minutes from tottenham court road tube station literally just around the corner from the british museum and a pleasant easy walk to all the theatres in the westend the concierge kindly held our luggage the next day when we went out for the day before travelling home so we could enjoy some more window shopping in covent garden without lugging a case about breakfast was buffet style and very delicious freshly cooked and there was a wide range which would suit all we will definitely be staying here again and won t hesitate to suggest the hotel to anyone all in all our short stay was a success
