room was comfortable but small however we were in the centre of london and the price you pay represents location comfortable bed and slept like a baby the seat we were given at breakfast originally was not really suitable to sit as you were right next to neighbouring table and no room to sit if you sat on the bench beside the dumb waiter we moved to another table breakfast was beautiful and everything was there that you needed we walked round london in the morning and after a very long walk went to collect our bags from the concierge i felt a bit wobbly on my feet and sat down in reception to a very refreshing watermelon water all in all a lovely friendly clean comfortable hotel we stayed at the radison blu because it was ideally situated to the theatre as we were seeing a show we are keeping an eye out for other shows in the area so we can have an excuse to visit again
