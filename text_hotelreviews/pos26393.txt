location x there is also a hotel entrance direct from the station concourse ideal place if you are coming to london from gatwick and want to minimize the time figuring out where to leave your luggage how long to leave for travelling between hotel and airport etc plus victoria station has lots of surprising shops that are represented around the concourse m guessing these are for busy weekday commuters these are quieter at the weekend we also squeezed in a trip to brighton and back on sunday afternoon yes it s really possible an hour each way travel time we extended our stay at the hotel to cover our whole london trip this was our first time staying in a victoria hotel i see the advantages of doing so again
