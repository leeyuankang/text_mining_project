the hotel lobby is gorgeous the location is ideal as we were traveling to gatwick airport the following morning and victoria station is literally next store absolutely the best location for us we walked to hyde park and the chelsea neighborhood from here it was lovely weather and we really enjoyed being able to explore on foot
