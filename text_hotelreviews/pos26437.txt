hi i booked one night at the grosvenor hotel between april and this stay was a gift for my mum and year old daughter they went to harry potter studios on the and were due to return to london centre late that evening i cannot tell you how amazing the staff at the grosvenor were they answered all my questions and ensure that my mum and daughter had a wonderful time they provided them with a beautiful room on the floor and a very delicious breakfast i am grateful to the staff for making an extra effort for my family and making their experience a memorable one my mum does not speak english but someone at the hotel that speaks spanish was there to help her stay easier thank you for all the little details that made a difference in their stay and in my peace of mind whether you will visit the grosvenor for a special occasion or wish to surprise a love one i can assure you this is an excellent choice
