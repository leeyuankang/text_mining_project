loved this place will re book for summer trip we stated here at the beginning of our trip before going on to glasgow for a few nights and then had last nights back in london with another hotel for the last two nights but after night at the other location which was nice but not comfortable temperature bed service wise we booked the last night back here had to pay extra for the room last minute but was provided a room that was a bit larger thought in our same room category sean checked us in and he was super helpful friendly and funny the rooms are spacious beds are super comfortable better than mine at home and the ac worked like a dream the in room amenities were great and they have a lovely room service menu for that late night snack wonderful location you can reach it from inside the victoria station beautiful property location and rooms after years of coming to london or times a year this property is not the most inexpensive i ve stayed but for all the amenities and location its well worth the slight extra price we come to london a few times a year and will look no further than grosvenor hotel in the future
