my wife had to attend hospital for a day procedure in london as we live in eastbourne that is why we chose the grosvenor hotel for its entrance which is in victoria station there was no wheelchair access into bathroom in the first allocated room we were then moved to the floor into a small suite which was nice but could hardly get the wheelchair into the toilet and also no wall seat in the shower so could not shower i am an amputee of the right leg and because of where the room was situated i had to stay in the room most of the time as it was difficult with hand propelled wheelchair to navigate the corridors as needed to take two lifts one from the floor to the floor and then to the ground floor ho hum not the best place floor to put a wheelchair bound amputee if an emergency had arisen on my stay i probably would have been forgotten when this was booked we did request wheelchair access and also contacted the grosvenor to confirm the day before to make sure this would be ok i also need to mention that the wheelchair lift at the victoria station entrance was not working properly as i was suspended on it half way up the stairs until an engineer was called to work on it with me in it laughable i know but not funny at the time as could have caused a terrible accident if it had have broken off from the rail this hotel needs to be specific regarding what it offers in the way of wheelchair access for people with a disability
