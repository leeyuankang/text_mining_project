i did not have breakfast at hotel so cannot comment on that we had the family suite and it was big enough for all of us and our bags the best thing was the location a few minutes to champs elysee street and a lot of great restaurants around the staff were excellent and very helpful with directions etc one of our bag locks got stuck and the nice lady housekeeper helped us to reopen bag the beds and pillows were very comfortable the heating was good yet room still a little cold we had read about this before so we brought our own blankets bathroom was great and they had these essence boxes that you could attach to shower and the water coming down would smell better the bathroom amenities that were offered were great nothing less than hermes and they put enough towels for but the nicest thing was that you get free soft drinks daily and bottle of water also free coffee was offered in the lounge for anyone all day as well as these delicious eiffel tower shaped soft candy that were yummy and addictive i loved this hotel and would return definitely
