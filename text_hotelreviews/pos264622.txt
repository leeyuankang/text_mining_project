very nice hotel in a central location within minutes walk from the eiffel tower the rooms were clean the bathrooms are quite big and we managed to get a classic room for a fair price so there is good value for money hotel if you manage to get a last minute promotion the staff at the reception were very friendly the neighbourhood of the hotel is chic and quiet
