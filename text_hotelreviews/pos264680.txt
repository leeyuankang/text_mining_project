as soon as we arrived i explained to antoine at the reception that i had read a ladies comments of a room with a balcony immediately we were upgraded very impressed with this very clean room although we were missing a robe and slippers to get to the pool but all was not lost we didn t have breakfast as it was a little expensive for what you got we did have a bakery next door which made it easy to get croissants would most definitely go back again the hotel was clean with easy access to other areas with the metro mins away the maid we had cleaning the floor was lovely even though there was a language barrier she was most helpful on our final morning the reception lady and i had a lovely chat about health in general very lovely young lady
