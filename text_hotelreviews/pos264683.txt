we chose the property because of the parking we loved the location it was half a block from the metro that goes straight to the louvre near lots of restaurants a nice wide street and best of all the front desk staff was always so nice and helpful there is also a street market right in front of the hotel two days a week thursdays and saturdays it s really a great place and i would stay there again we came back two more times and it was our favorite hotel
