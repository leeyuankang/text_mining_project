for the price paid normal rate i thought this was a good value hotel plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities the room was smallish but well laid out i stayed for one night the location is great and if you re visiting london for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at paddington
