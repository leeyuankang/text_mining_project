the hotel is the perfect location for doing the tourist thing amazing staff especially corina front desk so helpful the rooms are quite basic and cute if you get offered a cheap upgrade and want a bit of luxury go for it but we got an amazing deal for the centre of london and the hotel is really beautiful and grand we peaked too soon on cocktails in the locals bars so decided to try the chinese restaurant down stairs and so glad we did the food was amazing literally best chinese food ever can t recommend this hotel more such a great price and with the underground literally two seconds away it s perfect to get around to see everything
