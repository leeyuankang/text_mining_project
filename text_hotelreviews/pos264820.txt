the rooms are aesthetically pleasing and rather spacious we liked that it was located next to the metro and bus stops we love the fact that the hotel provided us with a samsung mobile phone that allowed us to commute with much ease in paris honestly this was a big thing because we did not have time to get a sim card in paris upon arrival and on sunday everywhere is closed the mobile phone was a very plus point there the staff was really pleasant and helpful we got lost on the first day and the duty manager came out to take us to the hotel we were also upgraded to a larger room as it was our honeymoon we really enjoyed our time in paris and les theatres was part of the reason
