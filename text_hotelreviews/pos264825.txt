excellent customer service good selection for room service bed was very comfortable when other reviews say the bathroom doesn t have a door that is actually false as the toilet area does have a door and the bathroom has a very nice open setup front desk was helpful and very courteous overall a great hotel for the price and it is very near public transportation restaurants and more
