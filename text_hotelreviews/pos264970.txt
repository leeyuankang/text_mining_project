this hotel was great the breakfast was amazing the glazed donuts were especially tasty almost too much hehe used the room service two times in total both during the late evening night and the food was good and delivered fast the staff was very helpful in finding and ordering tickets for attractions such as the city tour bus and the london dungeon a short walk away from the underground stations great portland street and regent street making it possible for us to go pretty much anywhere in the city centre i would definitely stay here again
