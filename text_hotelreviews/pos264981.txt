i stayed for three nights the location is excellent easy walking distance from marylebone high street and also many other local restaurants the thing that really makes this hotel stand out is the customer service i felt really looked after and safe which is important to me as a single female i loved the cocktail lounge the live music was really good and the cocktails excellent and some were quite unique not just the usual suspects the bedroom and the whole hotel was immaculately clean and well presented the coffee at breakfast is very good nice and strong and there was a good buffet breakfast very multicultural choice my only bug bear with this hotel is that i found the bed to be extremely uncomfortable i mentioned this to the reception supervisor after my first night and she went to great lengths to try to resolve the situation but regrettably is was not possible on night i was dancing till in the morning so would have slept on a washing line and i wouldn t have noticed but night was still terribly uncomfortable now this could just be me being fussy about my bed and the hotel did try hard to resolve it but nonetheless i do stay at a lot of hotels and don t have this problem i would love to make this my hotel of choice when down in london as it is so brilliant in all other aspects but a bed is a pretty fundamental thing to get right in a hotel i would have given this hotel a if the bed had been comfortable
