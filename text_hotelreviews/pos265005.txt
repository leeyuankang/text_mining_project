this was my second visit to the hotel having taken my son years earlier for his birthday visit to the city i had always promised myself i would go back with my husband of years i was not disappointed the experience was every bit as good albeit the room was somewhat smaller than the one i had occupied previously the hotel bar was fabulous and the jazz singer on the saturday evening was superb great location to get around london my son does not like using the subway and we were able to visit all the places we wished to mainly on foot it is definitley on my favorite hotels in london list
