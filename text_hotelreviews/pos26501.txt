the staff were amazing and it felt like we had five star treatment we were at the grovesnor for our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a palace suite plus bottle of champagne it was such a lovely surprise this was our second stay at this fabulous hotel its beautifully maintained and has a lovely cocktail bar plus excellent restaurants which we will be sure to try on a future visit even without the complimentary upgrade the hotel is a great place to stay its without doubt our hotel of choice for those weekend visits to london
