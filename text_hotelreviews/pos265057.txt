i booked this hotel for my younger sister and i as there wasn t room for us to stay with the rest of our group we were able to leave our bags with the concierge earlier in the morning this was fantastic as it allowed us to enjoy our day luggage free upon check in we were told our room had been upgraded my sister and i couldn t have been happier and we will most certainly be recommending this hotel to friends and family thank you
