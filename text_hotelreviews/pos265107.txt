the hotel is in a good location just walking from regent street all the staff where very friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and very comfortable our flight was late in the evening and we were able to leave our bags with the concierge so we could spend the day sight seeing i would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and hope to return again soon
