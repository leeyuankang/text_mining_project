the rooms were lovely and the staff were very helpful as our train home wasn t until at night the day we left we wanted to leave our luggage which wasn t a problem we didn t even have to ask one of the staff came up to us straight away to offer this service the tube station is also a two minute walk from the hotel which was really good
