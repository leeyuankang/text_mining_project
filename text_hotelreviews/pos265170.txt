i loved the dry martini experience made us feel extremely welcolme and they took time to explain all the cocktails and to find out our taste and ensured at all times that we were happy with everything also offered to help to make our stay more memorable all bar staff so friendly and could understand our scottish accent i am looking forward to our next visit
