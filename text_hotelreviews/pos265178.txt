we genuinely loved everything firstly the spanish girl on reception who checked us in was wonderful and welcoming we discussed some places i had travelled in spain and the foods and then the fresh home made sangria that was on the reception desk and our love of spain s culture and scenery i explained it was my birthday and we needed a late checkout and after a brief discussion with her colleague we were blissfully granted an upgrade to a more spacious room as a treat from the hotel wonderful the room was very smart and the shower was amazing but what we loved most was the original art that decorated all the corridors if we had more time we would have viewed them all as the hotel could humbly compete with many an art gallery of course the hotel was also beautiful throughout
