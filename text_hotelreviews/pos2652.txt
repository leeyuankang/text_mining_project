ideal location for paddington station and the parks and only a good walk to the west end weather permitting greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming rooms were small but well appointed lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good no public space to relax apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar we didn t eat breakfast but the food we saw looked very good the staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp we as a family enjoyed our time here
