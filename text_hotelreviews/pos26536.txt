the room was lovely and a good size staff very friendly and helpful lovely food both in the restaurant and room service there was a mix up with the rooms on arrival we were provided with a double room for a family of three and no bed for my daughter this was quickly rectified and we were upgraded to a larger room no problem for the staff at all extremely helpful
