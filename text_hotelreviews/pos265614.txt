had a lovely minibreak in amsterdam staying at the sir albert the bed was comfortable and the room was clean plus the shower was amazing we were on the ground floor so we didn t have a great view out of the window but there is a bar restaurant downstairs that is really buzzy and we didn t hear a thing the staff were helpful and accomodating gave us great tips for where to go in the city and helped us booking restaurants highly highly recommend it
