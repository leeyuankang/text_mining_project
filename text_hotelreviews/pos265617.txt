we did not eat at the hotel but it was packed from lunch to dinner and the food smelled great we wanted to explore the city s ethnic and international food so we never got around to eating in the hotel the restaurant is very pretty many people patronized the breakfast option the spread looked lovely and at very reasonable we don t eat that early
