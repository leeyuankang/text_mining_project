the staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinely welcoming friendly we visited for just two nights for our anniversary which they made very special for us with a great view over the canal if you re travelling hand luggage like us the room is well furnished with shampoo conditioner and shower gel and a great little coffee machine you may wish to take english tea bags we didn t try the restaurant as we re not fish lovers but it was busy and vibrant and gave off a great vibe plenty of places to choose from locally for food from around the world good location just a short walk into the centre highly recommended
