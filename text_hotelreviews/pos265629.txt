the rooms were small but felt spacious the bed was very comfortable and the shower was excellent upon arrival we were welcomed with a glass of prosecco the staff were friendly helpful and smart the room we were given was over the restaurant and the music was too loud but the night manager moved us to a quiet room it was my wifes birthday and the staff put balloons in the room gave complimentary drinks the only downside was the tram had been diverted due to roadworks but will be back to normal soon
