the style of the hotel was very much our taste very clean chic and their cosmetic products which they have in the rooms fantastic the staff was very eager to give us nice tips for our short stay and they were very honest make sure to check out their restaurant as well the gyoza are the best ones we have ever tasted in our lives a big plus is also the location quiet and not where all of the mass tourists go but still in the center surrounded by cute restaurants and bars
