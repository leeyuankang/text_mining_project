the hotel was situated in the most ideal location it was close to the centre of town and beautiful bars shops and restaurants however don t feel the need to wonder too far for delicious food as the sir albert is home to izakaya restaurant which was some of the most exquisitely tasting asian cuisine that i have experienced throughout my extensive travels through europe the hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating ensuring that we were well accommodated and helped with whatever we may need the rooms were immaculate and clean with the most comfortable beds we could not have asked for a better hotel to stay in whilst traveling in amsterdam i highly recommend the sir albert hotel
