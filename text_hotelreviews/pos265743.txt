the bed was definitely the most comfortable i have ever stayed in the hotel room was lovely with a great shower and quality toiletries the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly as it was my partners birthday they also put balloons and a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine in our room which was a lovely touch
