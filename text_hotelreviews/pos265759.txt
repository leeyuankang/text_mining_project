loved our stay at sir albert staff were all so helpful and friendly when we arrived we had a minor issue with our aircon but this was quickly resolved the hotel is in a great location with easy access to and from the centre of amsterdam tip it s worth getting a hour tram pass if you plan on exploring the city you can purchase these at reception
