the location was perfect just by the albert market and within walking distance for all attractions book tickets for anne frank s house well in advance from their website to avoid the queues park at the olympic stadium if you are coming by car use the park and ride ticket queue then catch the tram into the centre and keep your ticket this means you ll pay euro per day to park we stayed for hours and it only cost euros to park you need to keep your original tram ticket from the park and ride to get the discount great mini break
