to be fair we didn t have a lot of time at the hotel i liked the bedroom s style it was large and comfortable it is in a great location and suited our needs perfectly we went to the bar after the theatre it had a smooth ambience but the drinks were expensive compared to babylon kensington roof gardens in order to make use of some of the facilities i to planned to go for a swim before breakfast but found the pool wasn t open until am disappointing we didn t have the executive lounge explained to us so have no idea what that was all about but can be found on floor e via the lift a pleasant enough stay but will probably try another hotel in the vicinity next time
