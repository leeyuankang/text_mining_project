the fabrics in the room were quality and the room was quietly located as per our request the public areas were spotless most staff were excellent but zuzanna in the bar was exceptional she was so professional and charming we would return if only for a drink just to see her the gentleman pianist was a joy to listen to food was in the bar but room service food was excellent although an extra on an already service charge was unnecessary
