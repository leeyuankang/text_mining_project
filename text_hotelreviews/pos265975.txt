i booked this for my mother s birthday as it has been a dream for her to stay here absolutely fantastic staff the bar staff were lovely enough to prepare a birthday cake and the hotel reception staff did aswell as a a surprise for her in the room i cannot thank the staff enough and although i was unable to stay myself my mother was looked after impeccably and the breakfast did the trick after her lively night at kinkyboots followed by prossecco at the hotel bar again absolutely thrilled with the whole evening
