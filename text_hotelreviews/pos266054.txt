the staff were friendly and helpful and even arranged a birthday surprise for my husband the room was small but elegant and had everything we needed and was plenty big enough for us the bathroom was lovely and really big we didn t eat at the hotel or use any other facilities so can t comment on these the location of the hotel was fantastic as we were easily able to explore both sides of the river we we would definitely stay here again
