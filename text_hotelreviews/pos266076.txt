i was really looking forward to staying here as its a mythical name in hotels and the beautiful facade clearly demonstrates its period splendour first impression when you walk in it s a bit ordinary and sort of like almost any hilton anywhere there are many gorgeous period details like the palm court the iron work the wonderful old doors and old the marble staircase but you don t notice those straight away it felt a little soulless and ordinary and i think the entrance and initial public rooms could have been made to be much more elegant and in period that said i found our room very comfortable all the corridors are well decorated and clean not exactly my taste but overall very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely even if the bath tub was a little small and no overly comfortable to shower in no wifi in rooms you have to pay which is just plain mean for a hotel of this cost the health centre was a disappointment it s actually a gym open to membership to anyone and that wasn t clear to me consequently it felt like any gym anywhere else facilities were fine and the pool room was nice one of the reasons i chose the waldorf was for the pool as i wanted a relaxing afternoon by the pool reading sadly that was not possible given how extremely noisy it was with children and families playing the management need to police how the pool functions for everyone s benefit it also closes at on a sunday and given check in is at i was very disappointed the concierge hadn t mentioned this when we booked breakfast we had to wait in a short queue to be seated overall the breakfast was good and plentiful but i don t think the cooked breakfast was excellent when we left at the queue was very long so make sure you go early this dining room is not rally big enough for the number of rooms in the hotel and if a lot of people turn up the queue is long
