the room was very comfortable immaculate and quiet the decor in the bathroom outstanding and the gentleman who assisted us to our room helpful and very pleasant the hotel is situated near drury lane great for the theatre and close to soho where you can get a meal late at night as we did as we arrived late when it poured with rain the next day they loaned us a union jack umbrella which was a lovely touch highly recommended
