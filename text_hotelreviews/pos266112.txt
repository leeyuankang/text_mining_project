when checking in i was asked the reason we were staying there and i mentioned it was a special wedding anniversary later on a bottle of prosecco arrived in the room with an ice bucket and two flutes a lovely surprise which together with the spacious room and helpful staff made it a memorable stay as long as i can afford it the waldorf will always be my first choice london hotel
