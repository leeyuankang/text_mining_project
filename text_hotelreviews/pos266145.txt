everything was excellent nothing too much trouble for staff welcoming you with a smile we were late for breakfast as we slept late in this wonderful room but there was breakfast left wonderful orange juice fruit and yoghurt and plenty of croissants left all out of this world and we will certainly stay again there was of course fried breakfast which again looked freshly fried grilled there were also staff still cooking breakfasts and i can only assume that whatever you wanted for your breakfast it would not be a problem to give you i was sorry we were only on a one night stay in london
