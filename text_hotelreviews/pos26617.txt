this hotel is within walking distance of many major attractions buckingham palace westminster abbey london eye parliament big ben it is very comfortable the rooms are updated i recommend the family room which was not much more but provided much more space there are many local pubs and other great places to eat close by you just have to be willing to explore another great plus is that the hotel sits above a major tube train station as well as a bus depot right outside you can get anywhere from here i took the tube from the airport and walked upstairs to my hotel nothing more convenient than that
