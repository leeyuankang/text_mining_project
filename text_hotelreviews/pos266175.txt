the staff were very pleasant and helpful our room after a free upgrade was a nice size i think we would have found the standard room a bit small the location is great we didn t need to use the tube atall the pool and gym were very good the breakfast offerings of nuts seeds and creamy yoghurt were good and the omelette chef was a nice touch i liked the slight feel of faded grandeur and the decor of the ballroom looked nice where they hold tea dances and business events overall i would recommend booking this hotel
