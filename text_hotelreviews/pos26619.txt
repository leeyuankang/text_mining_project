the location next to victoria train station with its own entrance in the station save you having to walk round to the main one we had booked buckingham palace tour so this was a ten minute walk from the hotel easy access to underground tubes hotel has a bar and a more relaxed cocktail lounge but plenty of cafe coffee shops in victoria station to use rooms are comfortable and quiet you wouldn t know you re next to a busy london station staff at check in very pleasant and concierge were very friendly and helpful
