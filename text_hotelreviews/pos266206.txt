this is the first time we have stayed at a hotel that was wonderful from entering the door on our arrival to the time when we left every one of the staff was pleasant helpful and good representatives of the waldorf hotel the bedrooms were fantastic the breakfast and dining room were excellent and the lounge area very comfortable and relaxing on speaking to other guests at the hotel they all gave similar comments and a number of them had dinner there and said that the meals were very good given the fact that the hotel is so central and such an excellent place to stay we would highly recommend this venue to anyone visiting london excellent
