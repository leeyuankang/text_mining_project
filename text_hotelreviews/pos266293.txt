i booked to stay at the waldorf last night as a surprise bday present for my boyfriend i had come for afternoon tea a few weeks ago and fell in love with the place such friendly staff and the afternoon tea was the best i have had last week i emailed the reservation team telling them it was my boyfriend s birthday surprise and they upgraded us to a larger room when we arrived yesterday we were early and the room wasn t ready yet so we went in good godfrey s lounge in the lobby for tea and scones when we went up to the room omg it was beautiful i was so pleased we were on the floor with views of the shard a huge bed double sinks huge bath tub seperate shower and it was all amazing we went for a meal i had booked at our favourite restaurant stk right opposite the hotel then came back after we didn t want to leave we paid for breakfast in the homage restaurant this morning and i do recommend going for breakfast before you get a free complimentary buck s fizz and it gets very busy after when we were leaving there was a huge queue over all i would advise everyone to completely ignore all the rubbish reviews on here because it really was and worth every penny we will be coming back soon
