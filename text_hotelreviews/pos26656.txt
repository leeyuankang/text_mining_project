hotel was very comfortable and clean good beds and a good size room staff very polite and professional loved the fact it was right at victoria station and had its own entrance which made travelling around easy lovely bar and food at a reasonable price had afternoon tea in the tea rooms which was very nice and the staff again were exceptional
