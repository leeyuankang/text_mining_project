we stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central london central line tube and bus stop only a min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions considering the location it is pretty quiet at night this time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost we have stayed in lots of places in london but will definitely stay here again
