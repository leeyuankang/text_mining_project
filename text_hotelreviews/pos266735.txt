this hotel is perfect the room is very comfortable clean neat and tidy although the location is not in the city center it s really convenient to catch the public transport there are a bus stop tram stop and train station really close to the hotel just walk minutes the neighborhood is very friendly as well it feels like local people living in amsterdam
