the hotel was very nice with excellent facilities the restaurant was good especially the breakfast although on the outskirts of amsterdam it was near the tram stop so there was no problem getting into the city centre and back with ease parking at the hotel was easy my husband has to use a non motorised frame for walking and he managed it all very well
