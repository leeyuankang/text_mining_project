excellent and friendly staff the bed and room were really comfortable it was good that the fridge was left empty apart from complimentary water so that own drinks snacks could be kept cool the hotel is in a good location outside of the city centre where it was easy to jump on the no tram and then a couple of minutes walk the restaurant did look very good but i didn t have the opportunity to use it
