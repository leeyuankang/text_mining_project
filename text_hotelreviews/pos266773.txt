if a guest would like a real coffee not one from the machine but in real crockery then they should provide it was very disappointing that only one member of staff from reception went to make the coffee himself for us thank goodness he is the only reason i will even go back there again it sounds silly but there are no other coffee shops that are close by so they really should not have a self service and make this special
