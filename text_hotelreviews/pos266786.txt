everything comfy bed clean room friendly staff will definitely consider booking here again if i visit amsterdam again although location is not convenient it is actually very easy to get to city center within mins via public transportation the tram stop is just around the corner from the hotel which is very convenient would highly recommend this hotel if you are not the lazy i dont want to walk type
