i enjoyed my stay it is very clean comfortable and friendly we ate well in the restaurant and there was no external noise that i heard to keep me awake the staff listened and dealt with one complaint the travelcards sold in the hotel do not work on the bus that stops near the aiport i feel that this should be made known to all guests at the time of purchase as i bought the two day ticket to use it on the second day i was surprised to find i had to pay on the bus the card does not cover buses not run by gvb the hotel staff refunded me for the second day and i was very pleased with the outcome this i think is the mark of good customer service the staff also took on board one suggestion i made see across overall i enjoyed my stay and would stay again i have some comments in the what didn t you like section which i hope as a customer you take as customer feedback that is intended to help improve your service
