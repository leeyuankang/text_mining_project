hotel was fine little far from city centre but the tram line was perfect for getting in and out and it was for a unlimited ticket rush hour can be a little cramped it nothing unusual there taxis are far too expensive so look up public transport before you go lots to see and do in amsterdam but if i was to go again i d book a hotel closer to the city as the spa facilities were okay but we hardly used them as there is so much to do in the city
