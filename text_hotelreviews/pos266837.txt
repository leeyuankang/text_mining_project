the hotel itself and the facilities were great the room we stayed in was lovely and the staff were really helpful and friendly the spa is absolutely amazing although you have to pay when you arrrive to use it but the faculties there did the money justice the food they serve is also great the metro station was a two minute walk away as well as the nearest tram bus stop and the transport was every minutes a supermarket was also only around the corner
