the hotel was really nice we were staying in this hotel for nights and ended up really content with everything the rooms were spacious and cozy and our beds were comfortable too talking about staff they were always smiling and ready to help you and the thing that made this hotel extraordinary was their breakfast there was a huge selection of different food including freshly cooked eggs or omlettes
