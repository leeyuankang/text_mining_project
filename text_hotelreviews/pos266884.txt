the room was lovely after we changed rooms to one with a smart tv and one big bed instead of smaller ones put together this was handled very well the vitality spa was by far our favourite thing about the hotel it had many different facilities and it was great that our room allowed us free access to these facilities the location of the hotel wasn t too inconvenient and the staff were very helpful everywhere was very clean and my queries were dealt with very well
