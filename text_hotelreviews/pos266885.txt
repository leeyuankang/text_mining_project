the staff at the hotel were so helpful and welcoming throughout our stay keeping hold of our luggage printing off tickets for us etc the facilities were great especially for the price we paid and the spa was definitely worth the extra the shop in the lobby was also a lifesaver for forgotten items and late night snacking
