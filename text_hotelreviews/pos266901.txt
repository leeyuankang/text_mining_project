the hotel was in a perfect location for us outside the city centre but still had plenty of public transport options the staff were friendly and helpful the bed was extremely comfy and we had the best nights sleep the restaurant served fantastic breakfast and dinners at reasonable prices the hotel was clean modern and everything we could have asked for would recommend to anyone
