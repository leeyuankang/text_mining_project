quite possibly one of the most lovely and luxurious hotels i have ever stayed at the spa was amazing staff were friendly and helpful and the bed was super comfy even the sandwich i ordered for a late night snack was utterly delicious the hotel is literally a min walk to the metro station so it s easy to get out and about would most definitely stay here again excellent all round
