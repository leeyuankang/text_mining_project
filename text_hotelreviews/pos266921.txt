great staff girl at the reception was very helpful and friendly just like the rest of the staff the location is a bit outside of the central area but you can buy a tram ticket for a couple of days and the tram operates every minutes very nearby you can buy the tickets at the reception very clean modern and spacious rooms breakfast was nice although it s the same every day we ended up buying it separately as you never know is it really good or bad until you get to the hotel but i can also recommend prebuying it to save a few bought separately it was per person if i can recall
