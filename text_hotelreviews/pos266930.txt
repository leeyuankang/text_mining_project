i stayed for three nights with my partner upon arrival the staff were very helpful and polite and we were able to get our room key without any hassle the rooms are very clean nice comfortable beds and big clean showers there was also a mini fridge with complementary water the tv had various english channels so that was good to watch i feel that breakfast was a little overpriced being but the food we ate there was very nice they had a mixture of hot food as well as the pastries fruit yoghurt and hot and cold drinks we used the wellbeing facilities once i also feel that it was not worth the usually had an offer on spend they had an indoor pool with a sauna that could fit two people as well as a vitality beach i think as guests that should be included the location is very near to the airport took us about to get there on the train and bus it is not near to central amsterdam you would have to get tram which is about a walk from the hotel takes about to get there but you do pass a lot of places that you would love to get off and walk around after reading reviews it mentioned that it was noisey due to building works i can say i m happy we didn t experience any of that the area was very clean and quiet there is nothing close by to the hotel we did find two supermarkets lidl and albert hejen within walk from the hotel so we were able to get a few things from there there was also a turkish restaurant next door we visited every night efem which was amazing and had great value for money and customer service so overall a lovely hotel not the best location but for me that was preferable as i wanted a bit a peace and the tram is very easy to connect you into central amsterdam
