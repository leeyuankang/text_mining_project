very comfortable and clean location is far from the city but there s a tram about a block away from the hotel that has a direct line through all the big tourist spots including the meusam district dam central the flower market red light district parks etc if you are doubting your stay here due to the hotels distance please don t it was such a value and so easy and cheap to commute back and forth from the city hotel even has a direct line to the central station bus
