the bed was by far the most comfiest bed i have ever slept on the hotel had an amazing smell through out with little air freshness puffing smells ever now and then the staff could speak english very well they were very helpful and polite good value for money and it was right by a tram stop so it was so easy to get around with a straight route to the city the breakfast was all you can eat for each which is very good value when you compare it to what you can get outside the hotel but we decided to go out for breakfast and explore so i cant make a judgment on the food but it looked and smelt nice wouldn t go anywhere else will definitely be going back nothing negative to say at all
