what a truly wonderful stay we were attracted to the hotel at first for the value for money with regards to having a spa and it being for nights at the corendon would have only bought us an average stay in central amsterdam with no frills the hotel had a very new feel to it and smelt beautiful throughout the establishment rooms were impeccably clean well proportioned and provided a lovely ambience with the automatic blind system that shaded the room automatically when the sun came out exquisite spa facility truly one of the best i have ever had at my disposal it was evident that a lot of money had been spent in this particular aspect of the hotel taking into account the floor to ceiling marble haram breakfast was a true delight with such a vast range of beautiful delicacies from smoked salmon to a traditional english breakfast particularly drawn to the omelet bar where you could choose your own incredients and then have your omelet cooked in front of you the location despite being minutes outside of the centre was just as fantastic being on tram routes right outside the hotel lobby and an all night bus service stopping just meters away a wonderful stay was endured and i would highly recommend this hotel to any visitor to amsterdam
