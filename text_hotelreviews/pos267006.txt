the staff are truly wonderful all the time the hotel is outside the centre but that is clear from the get go and it is very easily reachable by tram in about minutes depending on traffic breakfast is pretty good with a choice of warm an cold food but for euros they should be offering fish salmon herring the usual marmalade champagne and those other perks of a luxury breakfast rooms are spacious and clean there is a turndown service as well which is great reception has a selection of soft drinks fruits and pastries with no shops in the vicinity also a good idea
