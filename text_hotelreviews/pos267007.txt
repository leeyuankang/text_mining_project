i usually stay at the hotel artemis few times a year while staying there i had to stay an extra night but this time they were fully booked so walked over to corendon its a little more expensive but well worth the extra cost i like the self check in and the front desk staff were brill will stay here again although the cost could be a lot lower i think for business travellers
