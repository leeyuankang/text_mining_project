all staff very friendly and helpful at all times hotel is very nice and spa facilities excellent we had booked room only but dined in hotel which was lovely and reasonably priced staff went out their way to make our stay memorable as marked birthday celebrations for one of our group with complimentary dessert drinks along with a rendition of happy birthday a little touch that will be remembered
