great room bed is super comfy well ventilated great tv relevant closet space comfy chair smooth lighting system the hotel itself is peaceful big restaurant and bar with a pool table food was worth it s price as it tasted great the location is okay only the number tram which was minutes to get into the centre and a short tram and train to the airport i didn t have time to use any spa gym facilities but these seemed very classy staff are efficient and friendly
