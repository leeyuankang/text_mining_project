brand new hotel so everything is new clean and great lovely rooms with mod cons good wifi breakfast okay their egg counter is handy as they ll make whatever egg you fancy fresh nice spa on bottom floor though be aware this is not included in the cost as i was lead to believe thanks booking com two food places but both quite expensive and limited menus for me anyway location just right not too in amsterdam but not too far out
