very nice new facilities in an area which would appear far away from tourist attractions however the hotel was very well connected to downtown by tram min walk less than min tram ride to train by metro min walk min metro ride and to the airport by metro rail less than min rail ride it was at the end of our holiday so we wanted to be close to the airport
