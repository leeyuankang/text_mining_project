we really enjoyed this wonderful hotel this hotel had character and charm and our room was very comfortable the main restaurant was superb and had great food and service the morning breakfasts were great the concierge was very helpful with directions and helpful touring ideas the desk clerks were very courteous and friendly this hotel was not expensive the location is great with a side entrance directly into victoria station many sites were within easy walking distance we highly recommend this hotel we look forward to our next visit to london with a stay at the grosvenor
