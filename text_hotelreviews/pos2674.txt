the hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry we also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right the customer service was superb during our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital the customer service here was first class and i would highly recommend it i can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us i would defo stay here again
