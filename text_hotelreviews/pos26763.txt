the back entrance to the hotel was in victoria station so it was really handy not having to walk around with our cases staff were very helpful i d obtained a breakfast voucher after booking but this couldn t be added on so as a compromise we were offered a free upgrade with use of the executive suite on our first day the concierge asked if we were going far as it may rain and offered us a complimentary hotel umbrella nice touch
