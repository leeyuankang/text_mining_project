brilliant location in a very hip area and close to tram and underground stations to explore more of milan lovely airy room overlooking the canal communal areas are very stylish yet homely and it has a lovely restaurant downstairs which exceeded our expectations in terms of quality service decor and ambience a real gem all round would totally recommend for a weekend break
