fantastic boutique hotel in the middle of the buzzing navigli suburb from the moment we checked it we felt at home rooms are a great size facing the court yard with all amenities you need for a few days in milan nice courtyard lounge area to enjoy a glass of wine or two a very personal hotel with great staff good spot to walk around and explore milan for all those who do not mind walking more than min to see the cathedral dinner at the bugande restaurant is definitely a must we ate there twice during our day stay food is fantastic and waiting staff also carlo was especially attentive and has a great eye for detail navigli is quite loud with a lot of restaurants and bars really great for the evenings but you hear absolutely nothing while in the rooms or hotel itself it is very quiet overall a fantastic little find we will definitely be back
