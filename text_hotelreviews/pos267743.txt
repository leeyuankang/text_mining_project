this hotel is in an excellent location in a really vibrant part of milan and yet it is only minutes on the tram to the duomo very helpful staff it has an excellent restaurant and there are plenty of other choices nearby this is a great find the soundproofing is very good in the rooms so you won t hear all the noise outside the rooms in the annexe are even better than the ones in the main hotel so ask to be in the maison privee
