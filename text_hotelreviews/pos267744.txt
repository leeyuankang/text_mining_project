we recommend maison borella staff were friendly and helpful the location is great breakfast is generous and the rooms are fine maison borella is a massive improvement on a previous hotel we stayed at in milan a few years ago and it gave us an improved perspective of the city our reasonable requests were dealt with efficiently and politely the hotel is really quite lovely and i would have been happy to stay longer the group agreed we would stay here again if we returned to milan
