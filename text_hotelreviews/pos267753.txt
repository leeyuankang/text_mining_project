the hotel is located right on the canal with lots of restaurant and bar options around we had a courtyard room with a comfy bed and the shower was great a very nice breakfast is served in the downstairs restaurant there is a cozy lounge and courtyard seating as well really nice to sip a cool drink at the bar overlooking the canal
