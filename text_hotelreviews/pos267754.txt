we pair were away for a girly weekend and chose this boutique hotel because of the great reviews the look of the place and the location the navigli area is great really lively at night with people out for the evening passegiata not rowdy though plenty of people of all ages we were really pleased when the reception staff organised us a table for drinks on the front where we could watch the people go by good seats on the frontage are hard to find so we felt we d done really well to stay here and take advantage of this our room was lovely very comfortable twin beds and a spacious bathroom it was quiet in our room even though we were there on a saturday night the staff on reception were very professional and the porter was a very friendly chap altogether we were very pleased with our stay until they spoiled it with the experience we had at breakfast time
