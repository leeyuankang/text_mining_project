the hotel and the staff were very pleasant friendly and helpful we had dinner and breakfast at oskars the restaurant but wouldn t recommend this the dinner was mediocre and the breakfast poor plenty of it but all the hot food came out of bain marie s and was mediocre at best the hotel is a minute walk to the koncerthaus which is very convenient if you have booked a show there
