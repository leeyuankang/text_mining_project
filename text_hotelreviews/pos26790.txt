staff were very friendly and helpful as there were six of us we ate breakfast in the lounge and staff couldn t have been more attentive usually we eat out for breakfast but because the hotel had made such an impression we decided to eat in and had a thoroughly enjoyable leisurely breakfast loved the grandeur of the hotel and it didn t look tired
