the location was walking distance to the main center little further to markets the bed was amazing so big and comfortable the pillows were puffed up they were like a airbags and sheets were crisp and made a very nice sleep bath room had normal soaps towels etc during the day the staff often placed complementary chocolates into the room and refreshed the bed the staff were very helpful and highlighted items on a map will use the hotel again
