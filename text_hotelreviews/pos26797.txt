the staff were very friendly and happy to help at all times our room was outstanding very clean spacious beautiful design layout and features the hotel itself is in a fantastic location for people visiting london to sightsee as it s around the corner from victoria station a perfect mix of the old historic lavish london you would expect with a hint of modernisation i would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone and am looking forward to visiting again a huge thank you to the staff for making our visit a memorable and special one look forward to returning to the grosvenor hotel in the near future
