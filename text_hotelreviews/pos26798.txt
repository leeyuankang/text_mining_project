made very welcome by the concierge who offered to check us in as there was a queue at reception the room wasn t ready which wasn t surprising as we were there for around am we were upgraded as it was my husbands birthday later that day when we had arrived back at the hotel our luggage was in our room and minutes later we were given a complementary bottle of wine and a happy birthday message
