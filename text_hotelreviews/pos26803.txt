i must praise their maintenance staff aziz who was not only prompt in replacing a burnt out light bulb but also helped me get a floor lamp as the room was under lit with only bedside lamps and a desk lamp he really cared and made an extra effort first to get the lamp and then to get the extension cord so it could be plugged in it s so rare to find someone who cares about your comfort in a big hotel the room was otherwise very good spacious and had windows so during the day nice and bright but evenings gloomy before the extra lamp
