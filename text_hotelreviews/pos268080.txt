the location is great it s in the middle of everything museums cafes and shops few minutes to see beautiful museums and attractions i enjoyed my staying in the hotel and they were so generous with me and upgraded my room to suite the breakfast was good the rooms are new and clean if i visit vienna again i will stay at park hyatt again for sure highly recommended to everyone thank you
