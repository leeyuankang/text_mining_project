the staff at check in were not very friendly i am a hilton gold member and my partner is a platinum member and because we did not book through the hilton website we did not get to avail of our membership we were not advised of the hotel facilities or where the gym was etc minor detail but still nice to be told what s on the premises the breakfast is slightly chaotic due to the large volume of tour groups so it s not a perfect location for business travelers
