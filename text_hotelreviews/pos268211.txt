the location of the hotel was fantastic just a short walk from the inner stadt and the main attractions for getting into the city from vienna international airport the hotel was less than a two minute walk from wein mitte station where you can get the city airport train cat which at euros is a bit expensive but only takes minutes we had a room with a king size bed which was incredibly comfortable especially good after busy days sightseeing the room was very clean and we were very impressed with the housekeeping service
