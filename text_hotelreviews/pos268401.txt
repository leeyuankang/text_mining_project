fantastic location cat train ride from the airport easy min walk to stephensplatz cathedral and central part of town or you can take the metro for stops the hotel is surrounded by grocery stores and all the essentials for an easy breakfast coffee meal at a reasonable cost friendly staff with very comfortable rooms as a tip buy your mozart chocolates at the grocery store nearby instead of downtown they are packaged the same and cost less great for gifts we will stay here again when visiting vienna
