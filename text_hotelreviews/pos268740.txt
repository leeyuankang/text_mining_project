the room was spacious modern and very clean the staff were helpful and friendly the location was brilliant just a few steps into the port area and the centre could not have been better the only thing is you cannot park at the hotel have to park in a secure carpark up the street which made getting luggage to hotel laborious as you cannot park outside to offload otherwise perfect we will stay there again it was all in all a really good hotel
