location it was so easy to walk everywhere the gothic quarter is charming and the beach is a minute walk away room floor balconey above entrance was a good size didn t use the pool but the terrace was a lovely place to drink wine and nibble on the tapas that are free with tea all of the staff were friendly and helpful we don t usually add breakfast to our reservations but we did this time and it was worth it
