absolutely loved our weekend away at hotel catalonia port greeted with a glass of cava on arrival and the staff are brilliant made us feel so welcome from start to finish we had the amazing junior suite the room is on its own floor with private terrace and spa bath in terrace the only thing i would say is the spa bath is not heated so because of the weather we did not use it although if it was summer it would of been amazing the room is nice and quiet nice big bathroom with lovely walk in shower and the bed is so comfortable the man who greeted us at check in was so friendly and made us feel so special i think his name was mikel apologies if it wasn t the porter who helped us with our bags was lovely too once in our room they sent up a bottle of cava and a fruit platter and we so enjoyed it after a day of travelling every morning a paper was at our door it s the little touches that mean a lot at tea time there are free food and drinks up until i think so after a night of sight seeing it was lovely to get bk to a lovely cup of coffee or tea the hotel itself is spotless and in an amazing place a few minutes infront of the hotel is the port such a lovely walk and a few minutes the other was is las rambla so everything you need is not far away shops bars restaurants and all the sights are near by or a little walk away thank you so much hotel catalonia and the staff for making our stay as fabulous as it was
