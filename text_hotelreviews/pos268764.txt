the location was excellent for sight seeing close to the port and la ramblas welcome was so warm a great start to our holiday staff were the best i have come across and alan printed out boarding passes for our return journey rooms were very comfortable we had a little balcony which was nice we were looking directly into an office but hotel is in a generally pleasant area and there were lots of other things in view as well breakfast was very nice but a bit on the expensive side we had dinner on one night in the hotel restaurant it was very nice and value for money overall we felt very comfortable in this hotel and would return again
