the hotel was modern stylish immaculate and had a friendly atmosphere it was in a good situation the neighbourhood is safe and it is within walking distance of everything after one night we had already booked to move to a posh hotel up the road but after a couple of nights there i wish i had stayed my whole time in barcelona at this hotel it is extremely good value for money
