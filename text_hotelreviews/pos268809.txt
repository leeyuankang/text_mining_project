location was great it s in the gothic quarter old town area mins walk to the port and bottom part of las ramblas lots of quaint tapas restaurants close by and cafes for coffees and pastries small and clean hotel very friendly staff we stayed in the suite modern small room with large bathroom and walk in shower the best part about it was our private roof top terrace with hot tub however the hot tub isn t hot it s warm we used it on the first night but that was it wasn t very clean either for the price we paid i didn t think it was good value for money the views were lovely thou and we enjoyed sitting outside of an evening barcelona is a lovely city we honestly didn t spend that much time in the room until the evening fab tapas restaurant close by called sensi highly recommend
