the bathroom is really nice most hotels i ve stayed in while in amsterdam have tiny bathrooms with showers that seem made for children the full size tub was unexpected very nice it s also just barely off rembrandt square so it s right by one of the hubs of the city but significantly quieter than the hotels that directly overlook the square ac works well too which was also a nice surprise
