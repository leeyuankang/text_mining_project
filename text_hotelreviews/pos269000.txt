bed was really comfy although two singles pushed together but had a double mattress topper so to be fair felt like a really big double room was really nice very well furnished also staff were very friendly and helped with printing of boarding passes queries etc the location of this property was perfect rembrandt square had everything and everything else attraction wise was a matter of walking
