the location was perfect quiet area and only a couple of minutes walk from the tram stop there are also many cafes restaurants and shops right at your doorstep there was also an ice machine at the end of the hallway which was an absolute bonus staff were very helpful and friendly for anyone travelling in from the airport don t take a taxi as its a small fortune all you have to do is catch the train from the airport to amsterdam station and then take tram very simple and very cheap
