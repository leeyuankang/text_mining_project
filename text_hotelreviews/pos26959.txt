absolutely loved this hotel with its nostalgic feel but it was the location that swung it for me as a person who regularly gets lost this was utterly perfect nothing to have to remember except that it was at victoria station door to door tube service room very comfortable and no smaller than any similar hotel in a major capital city so i had no complaints there i could hear the muffled platform announcements from below but actually i quite liked that and thought it added to the ambiance of a unique stay to sum up perfect
