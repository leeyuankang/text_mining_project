hotel was ok not a star i go on holiday times per year and i ve stayed in many star hotels and this was no where near the standard i would expect for star hotel cleanliness was much to be desired in particular the shower area tiles and base of the unit which requires to be stripped back and redone the only good thing was the area which was in a lovely spanish village and was only min by underground to the hub of barcelona
