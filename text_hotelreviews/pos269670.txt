the rooms were finished to a very nice standard as was the decor throughout the hotel the breakfast was good and most of the staff were friendly the location was quiet but mins walk to the train which brought you directly to barcelona in about stops the other direction brought you to beautiful mountain side towns the pool was very nice too
