breakfast was very nice staff were friendly and helpful the pool could of been cleaner as there was a lot of leaves in it the bedroom was very spacious and well air conditioned really enjoyed my stay here apart from the fact they didn t have a bar should really think about opening a proper bar restaurant as there wasn t much options for food and you could only get a beer or a glass of wine at reception
