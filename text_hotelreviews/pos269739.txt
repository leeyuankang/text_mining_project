this is a charming boutique hotel in a quiet off the beaten track location although not in the hubbub of the central rings the location provides quick access to the park transportation and the museums after a busy day of touring the hotel provides a wonderful respite the staff was very eager to please and worked hard to fulfil all requests there is a sense of personalized service and attention our room was nicely sized and comfortable
