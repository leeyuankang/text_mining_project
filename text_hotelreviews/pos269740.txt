one of the best hotels i ever stayed in the attention to detail in the rooms and living area is amazing the restaurant is beautiful tranquil and the food is out of this world i enjoyed eating at the hotel much more than eating in town staff is relaxed and friendly yet extremely efficient it is a real retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city
