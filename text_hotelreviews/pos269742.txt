during a previous visit to amsterdam i had stayed near the vondelpark a lovely location which we chose purposely on this trip for its being a bit out of the usual tourist rush of the centrum we splurged on the grand suite for our tenth wedding anniversary the staff were extremely professional helpful and pleasant we were delighted and touched to find a split of champagne and some macarons waiting for us upon check in as a nod to our anniversary when we needed our soap replenished after three days of a six day stay it was handled promptly adrian arranged for a bit of breakfast for us to take with us as we departed for the airport at the end of our stay which was beyond kind the newly refurbished property was stylishly and comfortably furnished there is also a private leafy garden with tables out back which is a lovely retreat our suite had ample well designed storage the only complaint on the ambience score was the electronic system which programmed the lights temperature control and indicators for do not disturb and please make up room perhaps we missed something in our room orientation but we were not able to put the lights on in only the living area for example while leaving the lights off in the sleeping area and although the bathroom lights had their own wall switch for some reason they too would be turned off if the all lights off indicator was touched by someone in the other part of the suite you ve never known pitch black until you ve been in that toilet cabinet without illumination quelle surprise i underscore again the charm warmth and professionalism of the staff because i now have a few words for the owners of the property we were told when we checked in that the goal of the experience was to replicate the feeling of being at home which i guess was to arise from the open kitchen at the end of the dining area the chef and his staff were also extremely lovely
