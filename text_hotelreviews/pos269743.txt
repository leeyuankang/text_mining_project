faisal from reception was just a delight to deal with incredibly helpful and cheery he made us feel incredibly welcome and was super efficient in assisting us with restaurant recommendations and laundry issues located perfectly blocks away from the museum quarter and steps away from gorgeous vondel park the reception area smelled amazing
