lovely hotel in an ideal location for exploring the city a short tram ride from the city centre the hotel was comfortable and has been refurbished to a very high standard modern clean and bright the staff were all very friendly and helpful our only regret is we only booked for nights so much to see and do and unfortunately we didn t get time to do everything we will come again and stay at this hotel
