brand new hotel with all the advantages and disadvantages bed is super comfy the whole hotel is charming the design is beautiful the location is great one can sense that they are doing their best to do the whole thing right but it seems that they kind of lack the experience to accomplish this goal the staff is trying to be nice and helpful but they sometimes lack experience confidence and or genuineness to really do so entire staff would need better training
