my boyfriend and i have just returned from amsterdam i had surprised him with a trip for his birthday we had the most fabulous stay at pillows hotel i couldn t fault one thing from start to finish from reception to bedrooms the hotel was clean and modern with a boutiquey feel throughout you could sleep for days in those beds and make snow angels in the thick plush carpets what comfort dreams are made of as for the staff i can t stress enough how fabulous they were friendly calm up for laugh and incredibly attentive they did everything to make our stay the most special it could be at the start we experienced a slight mix up with our room thought what we had booked had a terrace but this was quickly resolved by the fantastic staff who showed us to a different room equally as fabulous that was better suited to our requirements if of interest swapped to basement room it had doors that led to an outdoor patio since it was a celebratory trip i had asked the hotel to decorate the room with balloons etc for when we arrived back to the hotel after a day in town normally a hotel would just put a bottle of champagne on ice but on hearing my boyfriend has more of a sweet tooth than love for alcohol the hotel manager kindly went out herself to source a selection of sweets and chocolates to sprinkle around the room with balloons and a birthday banner what a woman all in all i can t recommend this place enough i will most definitely be returning there on my next trip to amsterdam and can only hope that they expand to more cities around the world
