a very stylish boutique hotel set in a lovely neighbourhood near the vondelpark just a short walk from the rijks and van gogh museum super comfy beds modern appliances and decor and great variety of breakfast options however the best thing about this hotel is the friendly staff who were so welcoming and helpful throughout our entire trip we highly recommend this hotel and would definitely come back
