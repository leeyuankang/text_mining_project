this hotel is just fabulous we a group of six females stayed to january when the hotel reopened as pillows anna formerly santon hotel de filasoof the decoration of the hotel is exquisite and makes you feel at home i highly recommend for solo travellers couples and small groups upon our arrival we was greeted by the staff who welcomed us and sat us by the fireplace this was so cosy and warming given the very cold weather we stayed in the luxury double small rooms each room is slightly different given the shape of each room however each room is as nice as the other my room faced the front of the building which gave views of the street and the beautiful buildings opposite we also had a balcony which added another special touch the large double bed was very comfortable and allows for a good nights sleep the shower was also great with a good amount of water pressure the hotel is a minute walk to leidseplein or the number tram can be used there is local supermarket nearby as well as coffee shops for breakfast we had breakfast at the hotel during our stay for the two mornings and this was delicious the staff are very attentive and willing to go the extra mile to please you i had yoghurt and granola scrambled eggs and toast other options are available including smoked salmon local cheeses pastries and fruit to name a few the selection is good and it is nice that the kitchen is open for the visitors to see which also makes you feel as if you are at home rather then in a hotel the dining area has views of the garden and the neighbour s gardens this was extra special as two horses can be seen which is unusual to see in a city the hotel has a traditional spiral staircase which can be used however there is also a lift so would be ideal for any visitor with any mobility difficulties this is one of the best hotels i have stayed at and will be staying at again when i return for a future visit
