the staff was very kind even before the arrival they were answering promptly to my requests breakfast buffet has a large variety of food despite the small dimensions of the restaurant food was was delicious the room was clean and the bed very comfortable but the best part is the position you are in the pedestrian area in the innere stadt i would definitely recommend this hotel
