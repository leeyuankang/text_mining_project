superb location walking distance to all major attractions in the first district of vienna we loved our room with comfy beds and it is always good to be able to open the windows for air the rooms are a bit like schoenbrunn palace very authentic old viennese style hotel with great history in a great location the breakfast was great friendly staff definitely would book again great value for money overall
