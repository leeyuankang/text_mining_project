the location of the hotel was excellent because you could easily reach all the main sights by walking and if not the u bahn was close by as were the trams the staff were always polite and helpful readily finding out where places were such as cafe neko where cats roam amongst the customers the lovely sack of chocolates on the door handle for michaelmas the next morning was a thoughtful touch the hotel is also in a quiet safe side street beautifully decorated for christmas this hotel gives an atmosphere of the real austria the cat train which links the city centre to the airport is very efficient
