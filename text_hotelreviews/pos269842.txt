the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the d cor was traditional in keeping with the age and style of the hotel and just to our taste the location was perfect for exploring on foot the many wonders of central vienna and yet it was so quiet a great choice of food and beverages at breakfast in a delightful bright room whilst it belongs to a chain of hotels it had a family owned feel to it
