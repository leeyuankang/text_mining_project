for an australian travelling by herself this proved to be in a brilliant location to easily reach all tourist attractions staff were super friendly and helpful particularly lutta rooms are very comfortable and in an older viennese style do not stay here if you want super modern and ultra stylish but i would highly recommend if you want to experience a little bit of older world grace and charm albeit a little outdated great breakfasts with eggs cooked on request which was great very helpful also in storing luggage before and after checkout with great facilities for washing up if your room is not ready or you have already checked out bathroom was generous beds large and linen clean and crisp room was reasonably quiet certainly no street noise and i felt very safe at night highly recommend
