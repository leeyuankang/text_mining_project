the room apart from it getting too warm and the bathroom good decor clean with good facilities the breakfast good selection from the buffet although fried eggs proved to be an option too far the staff at all times helpful polite and welcoming all round a good and comfortable hotel and extremely well situated in the city it would be will be top of my list for my next visit
