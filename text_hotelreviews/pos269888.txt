a lovely hotel excellent location right in the heart of the city so convenient for shops and attractions but as it is located in a pedestrian only street it is very quiet staff could not be more helpful with some great suggestions on where to go and where to eat breakfast was really nice particularly the nut bread there was a lot of choice from cereals to cold meats fruit yogurts to hot selection with an option to have other elements freshly cooked if required you could not fault it but note that the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar facilities but with so many eateries on its door step it is not a problem rooms were very comfortable and well equipped not often do you get a kettle in your room aboard these days beds very good and ensuite bathroom a good size with great pressure in the showers and lovely towels considering it is a very old building the hotel was excellent and had a very cozy atmosphere we will be back
