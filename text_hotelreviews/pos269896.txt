everything was perfect exquisite quiet and elegant location though in the mid of the historic centre close to metro and tram stops and within walking distance to many attractions and places of interest clean comfort though the beds were so soft rooms were elegantly decorated very nice staff especially diana who was so helpful breakfast was good enough all in all it was a perfect stay i would definitely stay there again
