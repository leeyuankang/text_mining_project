this was the most amazing place to stay in vienna everything starting with the location on the most authentic quiet street of vienna but just off the main drag min from the opera with your luggage to the hotel design traditional viennese breakfast public area and room was so very authentic and adorable we had to come back later to vienna for just one more night and we booked this hotel again although it was more expensive as our initially booked place for that night the spiral staircase the pictures on the wall your room names the way the breakfast is being presented are absolutely unique and you feel a very pampered guest in this unique hotel
