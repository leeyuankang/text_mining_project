i ve been staying at the hotel since the mid s when it was a family enterprise it is now commercial but so are a lot of hotels worldwide and new construction in vienna this review is colored by memories years ago when i first stayed at the mailberger hof it was a scrumptious little place in the inner city hidden a bit from the mainstream foot traffic or in the old days auto traffic as well we also remember staying there in the early when we were making one of our personal pilgrimages to one of the most classically beautiful cities in the world at that time there was one apartment at the top level of the hotel now more gracious and large and we and our children now early stayed there for a month based on currency the hotel has aged a lot along with its furnishings and fun has transformed into functional it is definitely that and easy to recommend as price worthy and location terrific if you want to be in the first district
