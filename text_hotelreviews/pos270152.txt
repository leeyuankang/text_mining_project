excellent central location yet in side street excellent breakfast good choice and variety and could be taken in pleasant courtyard good pot of tea if you like your tea in mornings friendly staff superior room spacious while the bathroom was not new it was clean and everything working in good order with a bath and hand held shower we had bedroom at front of hotel although can be a little noisy from the side street in evenings with windows closed could not hear anything there are rooms facing the courtyard in the lounge you could help yourself to refreshments any time of the day which was a lovely idea
