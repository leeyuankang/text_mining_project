brilliant location for a vienna city break literally a min walk from the centre and a min walk from both the opera and stephans dom an old world austrian hotel with welcoming and friendly staff a pleasant garden for breakfast although i assume it could be a little dark and gloomy in the winter a good breakfast and a good lounge with free refreshments
