this is a very nice hotel with a fantastic location connects to victoria station so if you are flying out of gatwick you can walk through the back door of the hotel into the station and catch the express to the airport the location is also a minute walk to buckingham palace minute walk to westminster abbey and a minute walk to big ben and parliament it is an older hotel but has been remodeled and upgraded and is very nice rooms are much larger than you would think and the bed is very comfortable bathrooms in some rooms are much larger than others staff was great
