i had a nicely decorated cozy room for one on the floor in the mornings the chimney next to my window woke me up with the smell of freshly made pancakes the breakfast it s delicious and nicely diverse even if the sausages and bacon isn t quite your thing i especially loved the mushrooms coffee and the small dutch pancakes i really appreciated that in addition to basic milk also a vegetarian option alpro s almond milk was served everything felt fresh and hand made it was also nice that you don t have to pay for the breakfast before actually checking what is served all in all the breakfast was good value for the money free coffee tea vegetables small muffins croissants etc available in the first floor outside the breakfast hours also a possibility for take away cups location the area is rather peaceful but with great public transportation e g trams no and which goes to the city central also the amsterdam zuid train station train to the airport and rai conference center are less than min walk away really friendly and helpful staff possibility to leave your luggage to the hotel before the check in and after the check out the room was quiet and peaceful even though the elevator located almost next to it
