surprisingly spacious room on the floor very clean and comfortable about a walk to centre but the trams were on the doorstep another option into the centre great location in a nice part of the city we did not have breakfast here as we wanted to explore local options great bakeries with decent coffee and lovely pastries for around five euros lovely bars and restaurants and shops all minutes away we did not feel need to take the tram few minutes walk to van gogh and rijksmuseum set in a lovely park
