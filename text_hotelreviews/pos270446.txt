absolutely loved my stay here i m from the uk and took my husband away for a surprise weekend in amsterdam the room was so big the beds were really comfortable my husband wanted to know what kind of pillows they had as he even wanted to buy his own were a young couple aged it was in a great location as the hotel was a short walk from a tram stop which took you into city center with the help of google maps we got around incredibly easily with a hour tram pass bought from the hotel we were able to get around the city with ease
