we enjoyed everything i can t think of a negative thing to say the breakfast was included in our room price and there was lots to choose from the beds were comfortable most of the european hotels we ve stayed have two single mattresses pushed together which is fine with us as it s a lot bigger than a double the hotel is down a residential street so it was quiet with a large grassed area with plenty of trees outside
