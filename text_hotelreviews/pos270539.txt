feels a little bit out of the centre at first but frequent tram stop of no to the museum square and central station just a short walk away comfortable quiet rooms helpful staff nearby cafes and restaurants serve a local clientele so in fact of better quality and value than central tourist core of amsterdam try le pain quotidien for breakfast and restaurant de knijp for supper
