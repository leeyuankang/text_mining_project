hotel room was spacious had a big bathroom it was very clean and bed was very comfy and i loved the decor location was great in a quiet area away from the night life but tram was a few minutes away which took you straight to central so ideal place if you want a good sleep after a night out staff were really welcoming friendly and helpful too
