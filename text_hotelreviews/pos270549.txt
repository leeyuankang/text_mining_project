loved the fact that the hotel sent us a detailed description for transport from the airport we opted for the train and tram even though we did it differently than suggested our error turned into our first good story if our trip hotel room is small be prepared but it works for two people just fine i loved the view of the green space and park bench from our window the quaint neighborhood the excellent cafe around the corner from the hotel passed the starbucks the short and beautiful walk to museums and ease of getting to old town people were all friendly when asked a question and easily engage in conversation
