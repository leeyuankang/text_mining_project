i have stayed at many high end hotels including the four seasons weston s and hiltons and this by far beats it expectations the location of the hotel is a perfect quiet street where it is easy to access downtown via walking tram or biking the staff was so friendly and accommodating the bikes that were available to rent were a great bonus and we used them everyday to get around the rooms are comfortable and a mixture of modern and historical the beds are very comfortable everything was extremely clean and taken care of and we wish we didn t have to leave definitely will be back again soon
