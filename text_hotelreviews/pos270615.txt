pleasantly surprised for a last minute choice very nice hotel excellent staff nice breakfast and perfect location there is a tram stop within minutes walking that takes you to all the sights and downtown the tram is a far better way to travel vice a taxi in amsterdam inexpensive and convenient really nice bar and theatre in the hotel as an added bonus
