the bed was extremely comfortable they were two large single beds pushed together so they were not actually double beds but no complaints about that the hotel was very quiet and is located in the suburbs of oud zuid old south it is approx walk slow pace quicker if you walk faster to reach right into the centrum there are many trams lines and the two which are closest to the hotel are no and and these take you right through the center and up to central station so in summery the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the city but just a short hop skip and jump from every thing including the major museums and vondlepark which is just a minute gentle stroll the staff are very helpful and courteous we did not have breakfast at the hotel as there was a nice cafe not far away that served an excellent breakfast variety the hotel also has a seater theater but there was no performances during our stay the reception and lounge is decorated in a past gone by with chandeliers leather chairs and book cases if you want a modern looking hotel go elsewhere we stayed in one of the superior suites and it was nice and spacious there is a fridge in the room that you can use to keep you beer wine or chocolate cool i wouldn t say cold but cool we had a lovely time and apart from some very minor things we would recommend this hotel especially for the mature person not so sure it would suit young persons
