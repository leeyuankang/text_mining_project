this is one of the few hotels in amsterdam where you can park your car easily although you will have to sell one of your children to pay the bill we first visited this hotel in the year after john lennon and yoko made it famous and back then it was considered a luxury hotel unfortunately it hasn t changed much and you still have to climb in the tub to shower and the rooms are still the same size we had a canal view room and it does have a wonderful view of amsterdam but to be honest this is probably the most expensive hilton we have ever stayed in and really you are paying for the parking lot because nothing else warrants the rate they charge the hotel is in an upmarket neighborhood and there are a lot of restaurants within a few minutes walk if you don t have a car there are probably a lot better options for less money
