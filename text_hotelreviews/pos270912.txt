very kind straff not that close to center for this price by city train it took us minutes to center too cold to walk later on the trip we saw cheaper hotels closer to the centre food not that good and very expensive have to say everything was expensive and that is okay if the standard would live up to it and it takes h for them to take the deposition but several days to get it back but clean nice hotel and very kind helpfull staff it would also be fare to the customers if hilton hotel could inform you that you pay taxes each night that you stay we got a chock when we saw everything extra that vi had to pay
