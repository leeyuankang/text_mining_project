the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating the room was spacious and clean with everything you could need and more one side of the hotel faces over a beautiful canal and the area close by is really peaceful with lots of nice places to eat vondelpark is gorgeous and not far whilst the van gogh museum and iamsterdam letters are easily walkable i would highly recommend this to anyone for either work or leisure
