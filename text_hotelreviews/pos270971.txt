no need to book with breakfast if you have access to the executive lounge although the range of items is somewhat larger at the full breakfast buffet the breakfast at the executive lounge is more than sufficient to fill your tummy the views from rooms at upper floors are really nice both sides with a slight preference for the old city views public transport min to the city by tram is in walking distance the staff were really helpful and very friendly
