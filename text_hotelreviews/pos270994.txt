the view is magnificent it s right by the canal and you have to book a canal view room to fully enjoy it i had the executive room so have access to the roof top executive lounge which has a spectacular view of amsterdam the breakfast is amazing it s served in buffet style and has a huge selection you can also order eggs cooked to your personal preference when there are a lot of people they provide another room facing the canal so you enjoy a nice view while they will put another sets of tables serving the same food so people don t have to squeeze altogether along the same table to get the food it s only min walk to the tram station and a few tram stations away from the museum quarter mins so very convenient
