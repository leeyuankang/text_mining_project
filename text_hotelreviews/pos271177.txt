the room was brilliant everything was nicely decorated and the room felt spacious we had an amazing view of the canal too the hotel was in an ideal location for us about a minute walk from the hub of the city there is a bus stop right next to the hotel which takes you to zuid station or amstel station in a few minutes loved the tv the fridge was handy and the free hotel shuttle to the airport was great overall it was fab
