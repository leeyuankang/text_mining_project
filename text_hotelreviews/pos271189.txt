bit further out of town than we anticipated bit of a walk to get tram renovations going on at the moment probably impacted on the overall experience room was lovely newly decorated but still some finishing touches to address some loose wires in bathroom and light fittings at door of our room extremely comfortable bed very clean only stayed nights and had fresh towels and bedding after one night breakfast a bit expensive so didn t bother but seems to be standard for amsterdam couldn t leave our luggage for just a couple of hours could only leave for a day for each piece so too expensive for hours harbour restaurant adjoining hotel was lovely but service was so so slow had to ask for sugar and milk for our coffee on last day we waited half an hour for sandwiches were lovely but we had to rush as we were getting shuttle to airport they re not busy but really need to up their game a bit just too relaxed overall lovely hotel just a bit too far out though admittedly easy to reach everywhere within half an hour
