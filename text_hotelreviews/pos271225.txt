very nice room with a view of the canal and a nice en suite bathroom the bed in the room was very comfortable very good choice of breakfast and both the hot and cold options were delicious the hotel is within walking distance of the museum quarter about mins but a bit further from the city centre than we would have liked although public transport takes you there quite quickly
