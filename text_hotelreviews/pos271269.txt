great hospitality a little far from tourist city center but still close enough using tram min walk from hotel min ride to liedsplien clean rooms good and warm air con breakfast was unfortunately not included nor there was a kitchen in the room but we ate a small breakfast of yughourt and oatmeal before heading out each day nice fitness room no pool great internet lounge and wifi reception throughout hotel very recommended for all but more for business than family vacation hotel
