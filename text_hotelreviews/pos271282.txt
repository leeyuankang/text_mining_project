lovely hotel they upgraded us upon arrival to a suite and also brought a post card and chocolates as it was my girlfriends birthday very nice touch the location is not a far walk from the museum district and a longer but picturesque walk to the centre there are trams and shops near by personally i loved the area as it was peaceful
