although this hotel may be a little out of the way for some people it was only a minute walk to the museum quater it s situated in a residential area and is a lovely quiet place to go back to at the end of a day s sight seeing it was our wedding anniversary and we were given a complimentary room up grade with fabulous views of the canal and complimentary choccies in our room on arrival the staff were all so friendly and helpful and the harbour bar and kitchen should not be missed there is a shuttle bus to and from the airport free to the hotel and to the airport good value verses a taxi
