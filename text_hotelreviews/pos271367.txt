all the staff were very friendly rooms were modern and spacious we got a room with a view of the canal good location within walking distance of the museum quarter we did walk to the centre on several ocassion but it s a bit of a trek not a problem on a sunny day as it s a scenic walk along the canal otherwise taxis are between euro depending on area time of day we got the free airport shuttle to the hotel which was great but a taxi back due to flight time taxi was would definitely recommend and would stay again
