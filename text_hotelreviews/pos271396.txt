we had just completed a cruise and arrived at reception thinking we would have to wait for a room but we were given a room straight away which was a bonus reception staff were very helpful and friendly tessa who had only been working at the hotel week room overlooked one of the canals and was quiet roomy and comfortable loved the speedy free wi fi nice bathroom and comfortable bed late book out at noon was also appreciated although we checked out to reach the airport in time buffet breakfast was fantastic and reasonable value taking the public transport tram to the city was easy to use and convenient although the weekend we were staying there was tram maintenance on the lines and the no tram took a detour but this gave us a further look at amsterdam the hotel is situated in a very nice area of amsterdam and although further from the cbd than many other places this was not a problem
