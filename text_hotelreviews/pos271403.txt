we were travelling with my sister who has had strokes and walked with a cane but were offered no help in getting to our room the room was extremely hot and we and adjusted the controls but it did not cool off and the second day someone came up from the front desk and couldn t control it but gave us a fan pretty poor for what we were charged we went for dinner on our second nite and sat there for mins and no one came to our table so we left and went to the lounge where we served our drinks so i eventually went to the bar and ordered our dinner the fellow was working alone and we were terribly disappointed in our meal i had lobster bisque which was left over dishwater with small bits of lobster good way to loose weight i was very unimpressed they didn t charge us for the trip to the airport but think about it this was a trip that we were looking forward to but this ruined it
