the superb service and friendliness of all the staff upon arrival our room was not available which was not an issue however i did explain that it was a special weekend our first holiday we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the canals and each day a number of complimentary treats were delivered to our room that s going the extra mile leisurely breakfasts overlooking the canal were to die for and we were blessed with sunshine dinner in the restaurant on saturday night was delicious and it was good to see the chefs at work creating their many dishes especially the sea food platters a special thanks also to the concierge who organised a taxi to eindhoven in order that we could get our early morning return flight at a bargain price a great weekend and i finally visited the land of tulips
