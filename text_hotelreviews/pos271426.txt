the staff were so friendly and helpful we d planned on eating out the first night but the bar menu looked so good we decided to eat in and we weren t disappointed even the prices of the gifts were reasonable and i spent much more on our stay in amsterdam not because it was expensive but because everything seemed so reasonable we d very happily go back again and would definitely consider the wyndham apollo for our next trip might seem a little out of the city centre but it s only about a minute walk to catch a tram which are excellent and excellent value and only about minutes by tram to get right into the city
