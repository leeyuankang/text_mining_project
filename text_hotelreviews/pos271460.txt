modern hotel with good bars and restaurants clean and well appointed room lovely corner aspect view of the canal basin outside was initially a bit concerned about distance to town centre a good but once we mastered the trams walk to the stop we realized access was easy and cheap and the museum district was only one stop away minibus shuttle to the airport was great too
