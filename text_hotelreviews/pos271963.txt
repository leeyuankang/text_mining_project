the hotel was in a great location and they were thoughtful enough to inform us prior to our arrival that a city wide taxi strike on the day of our arrival meant that we d have to get the bus included in the message was a link to the relevant bus service the room was kept very clean and tidy by two maid visits per day there was a large amount of choice at breakfast and the omelettes cooked on demand were really nice we didn t have dinner at the restaurant however the pizzas from the bar were very good
