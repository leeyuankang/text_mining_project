very pleasantly surprised with this hotel rooms are so comfortable clean and modern we felt as if we got a lot for the price despite being in a busy area gothic quarter we were never disturbed by street noise we were literally facing barcelona cathedral as soon as we stepped outside the hotel what a beautiful view every morning the pool area on the top floor is also a lovely little outdoor space with nice views loved our stay here
