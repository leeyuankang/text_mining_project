nice clean and central hotel although the overal feeling was that it is not worth the money and too expensive for what you get the food is great as is the breakfast although the breakfast should be included in the price costs additional eur the stuff is service minded helpful and friendly the pool terass is nicely decorated although no bar there just a wending machine that did not work the days i was there but i guess that should be fixed the overall feeling was that is was not worth the eur per day although i actually have nothing in particular to complain about
