the location was excellent within easy walking distance of many tourist attractions ramblas and the main crossroads for the tourist bus and metro the beach harbour is about a mins walk the reception staff were excellent and extremely helpful with directions and suggestions regarding sightseeing during our stay it was my birthday i had not informed the hotel of this but they noticed i guess from our check in form and the hotel delivered a complementary bottle of sparkling wine to our room on my birthday which was unexpected and a lovely touch so full marks there the room size and cleanliness were very good the beds were exceptionally comfortable the food in the restaurant was very good the rooftop swimming pool was unheated during our stay in march but my daughter risked it and had good fun there were comfortable sunbeds around the pool and i would imagine that it would be lovely to go back to the hotel pool on a hot summers day after a day of sightseeing shopping
