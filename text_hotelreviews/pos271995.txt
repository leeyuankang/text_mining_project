the location was excellent and close to everything the cathedral was around the corner and las ramblas placa reial mercado de la boqueira gothic quarter arc de triomf and waterfront are all within walking distance away there are lots of great restaurants around as well with a fantastic japanese restaurant just in front of the hotel and a hip affordable vietnamese place just on the back side of the hotel it s my third time in barcelona and i d be very tempted to return to this hotel or another one nearby
