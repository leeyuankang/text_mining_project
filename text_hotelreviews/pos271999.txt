this hotel is a wonderful modern renovation inside a gothic structure in a fabulous location in the old gothic quarter of barcelona all of the quarter is steps away and it is a short stroll to la rambla our room was comfortable with nice amenities and was spotlessly clean and the price for the room in such a great location in this city can t be beat the front desk staff was excellent friendly well informed and helped us with directions and ways to get where we wanted to go we will definitely stay here again if we return to barcelona
