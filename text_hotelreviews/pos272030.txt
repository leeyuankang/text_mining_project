lovely room in a really well situated hotel just off the cathedral square right next to a semi pedestrianised shopping street breakfast was excellent ate lunch once in the snack bar at the hotel and the food was excellent the staff were really helpful and friendly unfortunately we didn t get chance to try out the pool the location is fantastic for exploring the gothic area of the city and for shopping but yet was not overly noisy
