the rooms are spacious the king beds were very comfy nice facilities good breakfast buffet for we had two rooms one facing the front of the hotel was a little noisy due to the pedestrians on the plaza near the cathedral and the customers in the restaurant terrace across the street the other room was on the back and had its own private terrace this room was huge and also quiet
