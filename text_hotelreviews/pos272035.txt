location was excellent we love the barre gotic in barcelona and have stayed there before this location was even better than before close to everything and walking distance to so much more amazing restaurants and shopping at our doorstep the hotel was really good clean and confortable and nice to have air conditioning we had our year old son in the same room on a sofa bed it was a double sofa bed and there was still room for our cases not a problem but weird was the liftconfiguration from reception you take a lift to floor and then walk to the back of the hotel and get the lifts to your floor
