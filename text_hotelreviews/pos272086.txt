the location is fab right in the centre near the cathedral and gothic quarter shops etc but still very quiet and chilled the rooftop pool was lovely although we didn t get much time to enjoy it breakfast was excellent with an amazing choice of food the room was cool and quiet and very clean with a well stocked mini bar the prices reasonable too great choice for a city break
