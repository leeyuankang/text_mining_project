we stayed here for nights with our year old and year old in a family room the room was a very good size and children were very comfortable in their sofa bed our beds were very comfortable as well but we were gaven twin beds instead of a double this was resolved by putting the twin beds together but we would have preferred a double the hotel was very clean and well managed the staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was great the selection was fantastic and all the food was fresh there was even an option to order food from a small menu
