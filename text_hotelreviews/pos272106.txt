staff are extremely pleasent and helpful the design of the hotel is excellent the location is outstanding just a two minute stroll to the cathedral a minute meander to la rambla and easy access to metro buses and shopping the gaudi cathedral is a bit of a walk but certainly worth the effort this is an old building tastefully modernised and well thought out when you arrive check out the spectacular hand painted atrium it took the artist months and we had the pleasure of seeing him both at work and finishing his creation
