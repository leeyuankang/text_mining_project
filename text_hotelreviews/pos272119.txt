both our bedroom and bathroom were well equipped spacious and comfortable i can not imagine what else you could possibly want for breakfast that is not on offer here the staff are welcoming and consistently helpful the plan of the hotel is such that although you are in an excellent location right by the cathedral the rooms face in to bijou courtyards and are therefore not affected by the action right outside the front door superb
