location in the gothic quarter just at the back of the gothic cathedral and minutes walk from ramblas and bouqueria market couldn t have been much better being on a pedestrianized street meant it was also very quiet good range of options for breakfast and the whole place was spotlessly clean bed was huge and very comfortable when hotel found out it was my partner s birthday they gave us a free upgrade to a room with a private pool
