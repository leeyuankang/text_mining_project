excellent location very central and an ideal starting point for a city tour despite the fact that the hotel is close to the cathedral our room was very quiet harldy any noise around the hotel there are some nice tapas bars and excellent shopping options the rambla is only a few minutes walk away the same for the more historical side of barcelona i can cleary recommend this hotel
