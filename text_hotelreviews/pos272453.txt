we travelled to amsterdam on the of july and stayed in element hotel for a period of nights our check in at the hotel was handled efficiently and overall the front desk staff were extremely professional and handled all my queries and requests extremely well i had an issue with the ac which was also handled very well the location of the hotel is a bit away from the city center and that s not a bad thing as it is located in a calm neighborhood the rooms are quite comfortable and my year old son loved the large tvs that were in there not much of a view from the rooms as this is a business district overall i would say it was an excellent decision to stay at this hotel and i would strongly recommend it
