i loved the bed so comfortable the staff were excellent in tending to any needs or wants the room was quiet and relaxing the breakfast was healthy and plentiful had a burger and beer there one of the best burgers i ve had if like me you re not averse to some walking then it s a good central location to stay a nice long walk into the city centre but also within walking distance to vondelpark amstelpark and amsterdamse bos forest park like setting if you like greenery which i do a peaceful and quiet stay
