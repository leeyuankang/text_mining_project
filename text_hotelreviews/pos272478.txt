friendly staff the rooms were spacious and had a relaxing atmosphere the location was not in the tourist city centre but close to the metro tram meaning a peaceful evening and good access to attractions the nature themed panels and walls gave a calm ambience overall very impressed with the hotel and will stay here again next time in amsterdam
