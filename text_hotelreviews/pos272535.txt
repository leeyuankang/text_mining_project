had a wonderful stay and the staff were very helpful fantastic breakfast with a lot of choice great location with a very modern shopping centre underneath with every type of shops you would need to make your stay comfortable i would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be out of the city but still with very easy acess to the city by tram
