our room was super clean and comfortable with soundproof walls big tv and an equipped kitchen the hotel itself has a great location easily reachable from center and airport we reached both of them in less than minutes furthermore it s close to or better to say right inside a big shopping center staff are really friendly and nice breakfast was great and at our time of stay was served from in the morning which made it possible for us to have it considering our early flight i d definitely go there again if i visit amsterdam one day and i highly recommend it
