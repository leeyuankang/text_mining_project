the reception staff are amazing the tram in to dam square is an easy minute walk away the place is brand new and has everything you ll need a big shopping centre with supermarkets and fresh food outlets on your doorstep bars are half the price in this location than in the centre i ve been to amsterdam many a time i ve stayed at the worst hotels but also at the best hotels this definitely ranks with the best however it is further out from the centre by quite a bit but tram is minutes away but for the difference in cost then it s definitely worth staying here
