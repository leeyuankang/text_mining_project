the location is good it is not faraway from central area it is easy to get anywhere you want from that location you need to walk about min to the train station my friend and l even managed to walk back at night am from de pijp area back to hotel it took us an hour or so but we like walking and were able to navigate back the hotel room was really good size it has everything you need the bed is very confortable and you have mini kitchen facilities if needed
