lovely hotel perfect for a short break rooms were lovely very comfortable and clean food was lovely too the only thing was it was a bit out of the way from the city centre it was about a minute walk to the tram and then about minute to half an hour journey on the tram depending on where you wanted to go this being said i think i will stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending it too friends and family
