the stuff was very welcoming and polite they shifted the room class for no additional cost and gave advice where to go till we waited for a check in time room was not big but cozy with a street view they also had a great bar on the roof as well as small swimming pool if you want to stay somewhere close to the city center axel would be a great choice
