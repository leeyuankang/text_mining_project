everything about the hotel was wonderful the room was very spacious and comfortable the staff was excellent the breakfast was great etc overall a great place and very centrally located to all the fun in barcelona the breakfast had a very wide variety of choices to suit everyone the food was fresh and very well prepared we were on the floor on the is the pool area not in use too early in the season and a bar i was a little concerned there would be noise from the bar but there was absolutely none one touch that both my partner and i appreciated was that the hotel manager made himself very visible and was there to ask us about our experience he even made a point of calling us part way through our stay to confirm everything was to out liking these touches make a property stand out from the big chains of hotels
