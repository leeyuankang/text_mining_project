this is a sexy hotel very well placed the environment is very mainly thought for gay clients if as heterosexual you are comfortable with it i think it is a good choice otherwise you may find it too gay oriented there are pictures of semi naked men all over the place the room has an amazing transparent shower right in front of the bed they offer shaver and condoms in the toilet kit they have a spa with all sort of massages even something called tantric massage and they offer massage service to the room this place is nice for honeymoon or romantic escape
