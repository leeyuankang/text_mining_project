great location with lots of good dining options in close vicinity the gym was better equipped than most equivalent or higher category properties i have stayed at i enjoyed the ambiance of the terrace bar on the top floor the breakfast which was hosted at bloom across the street due to restaurant renovations was outstanding and a highlight rooms were clean and basic but functional i had a premium room which was a little bigger than the standard room but still relatively small when compared to other properties i have stayed at in the area for the price
