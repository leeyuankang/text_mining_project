the hotel is very stylish the room was lovely with comfortable beds even though we overlooked the main street the room was very quiet the staff were really friendly and very helpful the staff couldn t do enough to help us plan our trip recommending places to visit and helping us book tickets the hotel is very hetero friendly and my sister and i were made very welcome by everyone great location fabulous breakfasts great roof top don t really understand people criticising for having to pay for breakfast foods not included in the main breakfast or that a gay hotel looked and seemed too gay we loved our stay here have recommended it to friends and will stay again
