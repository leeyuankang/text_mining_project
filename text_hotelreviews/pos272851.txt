the location is very central and convenient the hotel is generally very clean and well maintained the staff were all pleasant to deal with the elevators were a little crazy to figure out at first but once i did they worked quickly and i didn t have to wait a long time i had a room facing the street with a balcony and the windows did a great job of keeping the street noise out the roof deck is very beautiful and a nice place to hang out although super crowded at night since it s a popular venue the gym was surprisingly good too it s a tight space with good equipment to use the spa was pleasant although the steam room was broken my entire visit they deducted euros off the usual price as compensation
