staff was extremely friendly and helpful great location close to other gay businesses clubs and lgbt community easy to get around the city from this central location rooftop pool jacuzzi and bar was great for lounging in the afternoon and on the weekend nights it was quite a busy social scene modern boutique hotel rooms were very well appointed comfortable and stylishly decorated
