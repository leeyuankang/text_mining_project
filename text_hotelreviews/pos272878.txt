nice hotel with a great location spa was a disappointment steam room was out of order and pools weren t warm looks like the spa should be great but just ok bed was uncomfortable i could feel the springs poking through rooftop bar was fun though crowd was a little full of themselves i probably won t stay here again but might visit the rooftop bar next time i m in town
