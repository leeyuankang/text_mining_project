i had a fantastic stay we were upgraded on arrival to a room with a view of the city the staff on the whole were happy polite and very helpful the spa was brilliant well worth the we didn t realise it was a gay hotel this however was no problem as a straight couple we didn t feel like it was ever a problem and all guests were very friendly
