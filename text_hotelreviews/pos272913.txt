great location but it s all i would not advise anyone to go there it s just a way to rip off gays they overcharge for everything there is a fitness centre but before even touch the machine you have someone from the staff warning you about everything they ask you to read a list of rules and sign it the gym is okay but it s nothing that precious that one can touch then at the reception when you check in they warn you that after no one will clean the room i feel the whole axel experience is very unfriendly
