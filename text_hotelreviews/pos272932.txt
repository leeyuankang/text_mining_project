the young man who checked us in was very friendly explained everything so well and very kindly upgraded us to a premier room the room was very comfortable excellent design and spacious it gave us some ideas on designing our house the location meant la ramblas and most restaurants bars were within walking distance i agree it is a heterofriendly hotel
