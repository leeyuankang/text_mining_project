the staff at axel were warm and welcoming our spotlessly clean room was quiet warm and even the wi fi worked the bathroom shower was spacious and a joy to use with plenty of clean towels daily the location is very near to some very enjoyable bars and a good variety of eating places all in all an excellent place to stay
