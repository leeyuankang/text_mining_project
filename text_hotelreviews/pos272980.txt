the location their roof top terrace bar most of the staff were very welcoming and open to help one of the receptionists i would most definitely relocate to both another department and a different field of work the bed was extremely comfortable and both my partner and i he joined me last minute and this was not a challenge in any form or way felt very welcome in addition the bottle of sparkling sent up as the request of an exterior room plus a wait for our room could not be met was a great detail on pat of the hotel
