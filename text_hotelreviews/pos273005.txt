ok i probably have high expectations and after a few years multiple stays in this hotel it s beginning to look a little tired round the edges that said i would still highly rate this place booked in advance you can get a really good rate for a superior room with an amazing balcony in the centre of barcelona the room was clean and quiet with a very comfortable bed breakfast was above average for the price of the room if you like weight training fitness the gym in the basement is outstanding for any hotel we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the axel hotel to friends
