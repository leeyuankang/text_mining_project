the hotel was in an amazing location and the view from the terrace was absolutely beautiful the hotel was modern fun and seemed to have everything you would need and more there was one member of staff working on the terrace bar while we were there who was particularly lovely she did not look down on us because we were young she treat us like any paying customer and she should be praised for her wonderful customer service
