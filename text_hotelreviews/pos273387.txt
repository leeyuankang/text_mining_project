getting fed up with booking com reviews of hotels they only paint a good image of each hotel and not the true story it seems that the prime function of booking com is to represent the hotels interests and not that of the consumer the hotel is a four star hotel but in truth it is only an average star its saving grace was the excellent friendly staff
