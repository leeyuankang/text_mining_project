the room and bathroom are really good very clean good beds and bedding the staff is super helpful there is a nice lounge room if you feel like hanging around the location is not bad you can use the train to the centre just one station away from amsterdam central but there is not much around the hotel but other hotels and the train station safe area the hotel is very good for such a place like this one will pay a lot more if it was closer to the center in spite of being a little away of everything i do recommend it if you don t mind walking to the very close by train station and taking the train to get to amsterdam central which is very easy
