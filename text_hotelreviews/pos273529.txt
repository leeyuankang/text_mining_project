sorry was not aware of genius perks think the location is perfect nearby sloterdijk station nearly every train goes and comes from amsterdam central very frequently return rooms and bathrooms were great reception spacious and relaxing whilst planning your day we did not eat at hotel as so many places to try in amsterdam in short visit very pleased to have the possibility to park safely
