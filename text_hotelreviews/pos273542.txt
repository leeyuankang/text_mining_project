the stay was very enjoyable we stayed nights in amsterdam the room was lovely loved the bathroom and the power shower was ideal after a long day of exploring the bed was big and comfortable from the moment we checked in the staff was helpful and friendly i must say the place was very clean and the lounge downstairs by reception is beautiful and a great place to chill out especially thanks to to the free self service tea and coffee all day and night a minute walk to station which takes you to city in minutes alternatively or public transport cards allow you to get the tram throughout the city including from by the hotel the spar is located mins from the hotel and is cheap we would definitely stay at the urban lodge hotel again and would highly recommend it to anyone
