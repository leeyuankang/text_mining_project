the location was very convenient just minutes by train from centraal station we bought the amsterdam travel ticket day card and it included the train highly recommended if you plan on staying here the staff was really friendly and helped us with many things the room was large and pleasant there were some noise from the hallway but nothing that bothered us the breakfast was more extensive than usual and tasty all in all a beautiful modern hotel with nice interiors
