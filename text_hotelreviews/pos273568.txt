the hotel was just a few minutes walk from sloterdijk station which was just two stops from the airport so it was really easy to get to we were a group of four and asked for twin rooms close to one another and were given interconnecting rooms which was great the staff were really friendly the beds were comfortable and rooms were well soundproofed we hardly heard any noise even between the interconnecting rooms the shower was nice with two types of shower heads to use the rooms were big enough with a modern ikea like design lots of plug and usb ports for charging things the hairdryer was good quality and really powerful breakfast was buffet style and the selection was perfect fresh fruit yogurts muesli cereal eggs bacon pancakes toast cheese cold meats pretty much something for everyone and the unlimited free coffee was really good
