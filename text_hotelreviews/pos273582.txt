this was our second time in amsterdam and we had plans to visit keukenhof as well as getting from schiphol airport so the location for that matter was really convenient the hotel is quite new and the decoration is really a plus for this price range it was a good surprise the room is cosy well decorated and had strong wifi signl we also had great quality value breakfast one day which was booked in advance they have a system to customize your stay in advance with discounts the same system asks you by mail during your stay how things are going i have reported a minor issue and got a quick response so it really worked also enjoyed the lounge bar
