nice big comfortable bed great bathroom facilities nice touch with free tea coffee every day didn t have the breakfast as it looked a little overpriced there is a spa in mins walk and with a fridge in the room you can store some ham cheese yoghurt fruit for breakfast at a fraction of the price very comfortable stay would highly recommend the extra cost of room with a bath
