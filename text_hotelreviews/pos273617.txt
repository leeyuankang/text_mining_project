the location is excellent as it is a short walk to the metro train station and then central amsterdam is the first stop the food in the restaurant lounge on the property was amazing i had a salmon dinner that was off the charts good in fact i had to compliment the kitchen staff after dinner we went to the main lounging area with a beautiful wood games table that we played cards with the kids and sipped on wine the hotel itself is very modern but had a rustic feel with neat wood and concrete mix very cool
