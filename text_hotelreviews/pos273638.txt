standard double room was massive and clean same was the bathroom really like the spacious lobby and the complimentary tea and coffee available at all time my booking was sunday to wednesday so it was incredibly good value for money location is convenient as it is a tram ride away from central amsterdam and minutes walk from sloterdijk station
