hotel room was pretty good everything was close to perfect the room was clean beds were quite comfortabe furnitures were modern and in good condition there was a small regrigerator in the room so that you could keep your food and drinks clean personnel were helpful and nice and all of this is for a reasonable cheap price the location maybe is not center but its just one train station away from the central station which takes only minutes also there is a supermarket very near that you can shop for whatever you need overall i m very happy with my stay in urban lodge hotel i would come here again
