location is great debbie and daphne were so helpful they gave us suggestions that were not in the tourist books and provided helpful hints on getting around it was our first time in amsterdam and we were worried that this would be so off of the beaten path but it was the best location we could have asked for i highly recommend staying at the urban lodge we only ate breakfast one morning and it was really good but we wanted to explore new places rather than only eating there
