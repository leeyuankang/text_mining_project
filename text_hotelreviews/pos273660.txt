we arrived before official check in time and we could go to the room because it was ready staff was friendly room was nice and clean with all the facilities you will need during your stay specially we liked design of the bathrooms lobby and seating area with tea and coffee is good place to relax after whole day in the city location is good little bit out of the centre but only min with tram to the dam square and min to the schipol airport still very convenient all in all i would defintely come again to the urban lodge
