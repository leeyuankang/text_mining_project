everything was top notch the lounge area on the first floor just fantastic free hot drinks the staff is extremely courteous and friendly breakfast exceeded all expectations and the hotel itself is generally very comfortable photo true although the hotel is not in the center but a short walk from the railway station very convenient as we came and went from there from amsterdam if i come to this city again i ll stay only here i recommend to all
