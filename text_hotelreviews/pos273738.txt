the hotel is really nice the lobby is comfortable with a fireplace in the middle and we enjoyed ourselves sipping wine and beer at night the room is clean and nice beds are comfortable the staff is young and friendly one of the best things is location the hotel is just a minute walk from the train station amsterdam sloterdijk and one stop min to the city center by train and two or three stops min to the airport that is why everything was very accessible and convenient during our stay
