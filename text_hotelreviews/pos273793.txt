the hotel is very close to the sloterdeijk station and public transport the staff speaks english is super nice and even though we ve had an incident with our room the problem was quickly solved the rooms are very clean and comfy breakfast was excellent but could ve been a little cheaper but apart from that we were very pleased with our stay and definetely recommend the urban lodge hotel
