the room was very comfortable in comparison to the usual small hotel rooms in europe they were spotlessly cleaned everyday during my stay all the staff were extremely accommodating and hospitable to my requests and questions about where to go and what to eat in the city it is located within a minute walk to the sloterdijk train station and stop from the city center i am really very happy that i decided to book this room for my amsterdam trip
