i was initially a little worried about the location of this hotel as it seemed quite far out of the city centre but i needn t have worried the station is roughly minutes away on foot so we purchased a day gvb travel card for euro each which gave us the option to travel by either metro bus or tram you could also buy the card with an additional fourth option of train which would then cost euro each the hotel itself is newly built so it has a lovely fresh feel to it our triple room was quite large and i especially liked the addition of a fridge the staff are quite young but more than pleasant and helpful with any queries we had i can t comment on the food as we tended to eat out all of the time
