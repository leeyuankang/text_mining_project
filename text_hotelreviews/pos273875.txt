the staff were incredibly pleasant and accommodating the rooms were perfect for us we only booked one night but immediately added three more after we checked in the hotel is just two blocks from a major transportation hub so it was very easy to get to the tourist sites the airport is two train stops from the urban lodge wifi is super strong too
