the hotel is adorably decorated in a lodge style including a fire pit in the lounge area my room was stylishly simple and clean the staff is very friendly and helpful the breakfast is generous with all the standards i had dinner one night in the restaurant and was well taken care of the food was quite good this is a great place to stay if you are in for business and want to stay in the sloterdijk area the location is about a minute walk to the sloterdijk station and there is a restaurant called bret nearby which has a good vibe
