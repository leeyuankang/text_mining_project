we picked this hotel because we rented a car for a three week road trip from amsterdam to vienna and they have parking on site and it is only two blocks from the train bus station for easier access to locations in amsterdam the room was clean comfortable and secure it was either new or completely remodeled it has a small bar with ice and a moderate restaurant breakfast buffet is good but eu a couple of mornings we just took the public transit to the main train station and ate a hearty english breakfast a block away to start our adventures for the day
