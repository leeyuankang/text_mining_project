if you want young and lively then stay away this hotel seemed to be more for business men famalies and the hotel was nicely situated in a quiet area the hotel was very well maintained the staff were very friendly and helpful the lobby area of the hotel is so nice big oversized sofas with rugs around an open fire getting taxis were expensive one taxi cost the next the train station was a minute walk with the trains being so regular and running until we just got those mostly
