our stay in the urban lodge was incredibly good value for money the rooms were very spacious and well equipped with everything you could need the bar area was very nice and included a very nice sofa area with a small fire in the centre i would definitely recommend this hotel it s not central but with a train station directly across the road and the centre only one stop away it is definitely a good location
