when you get out of the airport ask for a ticket to sloterdijk an when you leave sloterdijk station turn left and you ll see the hotel its only a minute walk beds were very comfortable was minute from airport and another minutes into city center there s a train bus and tram all located beside the hotel staff were very friendly and hotel was nice and clean would recommend to anyone small fridge in the room was great hoping to get back again this year didn t have the breakfast coz it seemed expensive but spar across the road do a great selection of food
