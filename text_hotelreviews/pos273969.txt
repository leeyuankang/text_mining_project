the hotel was a great place to stay the hotel the hotel itself is very modern with a very nice lobby with a great fireplace to sit in the cold days and enjoy the heat the staff was very helpful and friendly wifi signal was great all over the hotel rental bikes are available and the price is average compared to other places we saw with it going down the more days you book them the room while for people it might have been on the small side with the dorm bed open the couch opens up for people i will be more the enough there is even a small refrigerator in the closet the normal beds are very comfortable location urban is minute walk from sloterdijk station that has direct connection to the central station by train most trains ride or bus during the day or at night stores nearby there is a super market at the same sloterdijk to buy stuff for cheap
