hotel is very new clean and well designed modern but with a wooden feel like a lodge staff are friendly and helpful rooms are comfortable and the sofa turned into a bunk bed for our kids room space a little small for a family of but price was low so we can t complain good wifi too buffet breakfast was excellent with many choices of food and drink tram train and bus stations nearby so good access to city centre and beyond free car parking in front of hotel which is a blessing in a big city
