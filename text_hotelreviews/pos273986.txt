from check in to departure nothing was too much trouble for the young enthusiastic staff the hotel is located close to sloterdijk station stops from schipol airport station and is an ideal base for a visit to amsterdam a bus mins to dam square or a train to amsterdam central mins is the best way to reach the centre we had both breakfast and an evening meal and though the menu is limited the food is both good and well priced the hotel has only been open for about weeks so everything is clean and shiny the rooms are large well fitted out and the bathroom is superb a truely memorable stay
