this is a beautiful hotel with the most friendly and helpful staff as i m an amputee they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant they even went out and purchase a special chair to put in the shower location is awesome if you don t mind staying a bit out of town sloterdijk station is only a couple meters away from where you could get on the metro train bus or tram will definitely stay there again next year
