my daughter and i stayed at the urban lodge hotel for the purpose of catching an early train to schiphol as it is within a minute walk to the station we learned it was only their first week open despite the newness and the fact that not everything was completed the staff were wonderful and very helpful there are several nice cafes and restaurants nearby as well as the shops within the station the rooms were clean and comfortable i would stay here again if i needed to catch an early train
