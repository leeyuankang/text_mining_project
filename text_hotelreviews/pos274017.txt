lovely brand new hotel in a great location we were only there for a few days and wanted to visit the rld we were conveniently located a few minutes from the train station so commuting was easy would have been good if the hotel could have arranged discounted tickets though because it got pricey hotel very clean could still smell the newness of it room was lovely and wellequipped restaurant a little expensive but there is plenty to eat at the train station so that s what we did overall a very enjoyable stay and would def return
