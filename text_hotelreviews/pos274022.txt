stayed at this new hotel the week it opened friday sunday january and i enjoyed my stay in this quieter part of the city the hotel was easy to find just minutes away by train direct from schiphol airport to sloterdijk station and the hotel could be seen from the station check in was quick and easy hotel was spotless and everything was brand new i stayed in a triple room which was lovely with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom hotel staff were really friendly and helped us a lot during our stay location was great too literally minutes away by train from amsterdam central station it was nice to relax in a quieter part of the city after a busy day free wifi was also a bonus would recommend this hotel and would stay here again in future thankyou
