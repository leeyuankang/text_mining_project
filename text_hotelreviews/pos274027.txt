we loved absolutely everything about this hotel we spent weeks traveling through different countries and this by far was the best accommodation we received the staff was so wonderful and welcoming and very helpful the facilities were top notch and extremely comfortable and clean we also ate at the hotel restaurant and were very happy with the food we liked the location because it was outside of the city center but close enough for a minute bike ride into town it was the perfect atmosphere for peace and relaxation
