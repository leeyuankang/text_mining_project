the quiet street central location beautiful boutique hotel room friendly staff excellent housekeeping who reacted quickly to requests for extra milk for the coffee very good value price for a hotel in such a location and only minutes walk from paddington and the heathrow express the hotel also helped me to organise a surprise for my new husband in our room which was decorated with petals and roses the service is very personal and was very very much appreciated by us both
