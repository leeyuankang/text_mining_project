perfect for our family of beds were comfortable room was clean location was great not quite central but about a min walk to everything staff was friendly breakfast though not included was very good great variety vienna as a whole seems very child friendly and this hotel was no different strollers to rent child play area in the lobby etc they even provided child soap in the room this hotel offered us everything that we needed during our stay and the price was right
