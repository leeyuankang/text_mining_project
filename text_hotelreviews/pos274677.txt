the receptionist musa was very helpful and resourceful the aircon was turned off when we were there but the room was too stuffy and warm without opening the window but as the room faces the street it was very loud somtimes even in the night when i called the receptionist offer to change room which may not solved the problem but musa offered to bring a fan and brought it up personally his service is prompt and friendly
