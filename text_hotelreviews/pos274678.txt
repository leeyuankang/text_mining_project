great place to stay not in the middle of vienna but minutes away from all major attractions but for business traveleres i guess its not a key minutes from all public transportation very friendly and helpful personnel great briekfast when i booked the room i was sure i am booking a room with rooms for adults and children but when we checked it it was one regular size room with beds one standard and one sofa bed both very comfortable but for people the room was very small we spent most of the time walking around and were coming back late at night just to sleep so it wasn t that bad but just keep in mind when you are booking the room for people if you want more space standard room is a very small option overall great experience
