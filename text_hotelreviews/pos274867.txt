the location of the hotel is excellent as it is close to the principal museums there are tram stops next to the hotel and the centre is at walking distance the staff was very friendly and helpful buffet breakfast was good but perhaps a bit on the expensive side if i go to vienna again levante will be my first option for a hotel
