staff were extremely friendly and very professional we arrived hours before checkin and were allocated our room within the hotel had an excellent location close to the parliament and the rathaus underground was a minute walk there are supermarkets restaurants bars etc very close by breakfast was continental but enough choice to suit most people the rooms are a reasonable size clean and comfortable and the airconditioning works well which is required in the hot summer months thank you to the staff of the levante for a lovely stay
