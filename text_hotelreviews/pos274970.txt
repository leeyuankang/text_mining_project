the location is immediately behind the parliament building and well within walking distance of the center of the city there is a parking charge for your car which is euros per night but that is common in european cities the buffet breakfast was lovely and even included champagne and orange juice it is possible to order french toast and omelettes from the chef but there is plenty of great choices without this
