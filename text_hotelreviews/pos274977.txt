one of the reception staff was a bit negative when we asked about restaurants and brunch places we wanted to go to saying it would be difficult to get a table as it would be busy and suggested we walked along tourist areas and tried our luck rather than showing us on the map where these were located or offering to call and see if they could get us a reservation in the end we found one of the places ourselves and managed to get a table too
