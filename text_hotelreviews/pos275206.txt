the hotel was almost perfect we got a very nice room from the top floor everything was brand new and worked well there was a tiny balcony to the street but gladly the noise of the traffic didn t bother us the room was quiet pretty and there was everything you need the bed was comfortable and big and the shower was great on the hotel rooftop you can enjoy the sun and have some drinks there is also a tiny pool where you can cool off the breakfast is great and served until noon
