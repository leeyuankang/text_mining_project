the hotel itself was lovely nice and clean with nice polite staff the only downfall is a should not be located where this one is there is nothing nearby also the area is quite scruffy there is the metro mins walk away which is easy enough to use and takes you everywhere which is great however the surrounding area is still not what i would of expected for the location of a i personally would not of liked to walk from the metro to the hotel at night on my own
