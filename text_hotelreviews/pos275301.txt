extra large bed offered for a double room was great and very comfy the hotel is a ten minute walk to the beach and a five minute walk from nice cafes to eat in so great location safe area we walked late at night back to the hotel from the marina and felt safe plenty of useful shops and hour pharmacies nearby the nearest metro stations are each a five minute walk away in either of two directions with quick access to key areas in the city
