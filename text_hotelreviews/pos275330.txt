we couldn t have been more pleased with our stay here the staff were unbelievably friendly and went above and beyond to help us out with everything we paid for breakfast when booking the hotel and it was definitely worth it so many options and everything was truly delicious also highly recommend using the spa per person for an hour very relaxing way to spend a morning evening the cleanliness off the hotel and rooms were and the hotel room itself was spacious bed was huge with a lovely bathroom we were very sad to have to leave and would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers
