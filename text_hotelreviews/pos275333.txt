no water available only small bottles in the minibar which were not replaced by the cleaning staff the following day so on the second night i had to walk round barcelona for hours trying to find a shop the receptionist would not give me any water and had none to sell there was no vending machine and the hotel did not sell water this is very dangerous people have a right to easily access water this is not what i expect from a star hotel and ruined my experience
