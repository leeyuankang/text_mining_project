the hotel is right in front of a subway station so it made our way from the airport pretty easy we got there and everybody was extremely nice the room had a nice city view although we d have chosen the sea view if we d had known better the frigobar was free not even after minutes in the room we received a super welcoming gift a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries we told them in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and they were lovely the restaurant in front of the swimming pool was also delicious and cheap we had many amazing tapas and draft beer enjoying the sun and the pool view it s also right next to a mall with good stores and restaurants for a quick meal
