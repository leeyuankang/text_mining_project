we stayed in a room with a terrace high up in the hotel with an amazing view both of the skyline of barcelona and the ocean how about watching barcelona skyline by night from the bathtub the breakfast is excellent you can choose from everything you would like and it is also possible to make the breakfast really healthy with vegetables fresh fruit ham turkey greek yoghurt etc though it has all the pastries pancakes waffles egg bacon also the people at the reception are really nice and helpful high quality massage available at the spa i suffered from lumbago during my visit and the woman who does massage tweaked it a bit and managed to help me with that short walk to where the beach of barcelona ends or begins nice beach bars side by side where you can have a drink a meal or just have a day on the beach on walking distance from the hotel
