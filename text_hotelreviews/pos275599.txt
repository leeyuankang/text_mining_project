hotel was located away from the tourist areas and was quite nice it was only a couple of blocks from the metro and the avenue diagonal trolley and the city tour busses stopped near the hotel the sea was only a few blocks away and could be seen from the rooftop pool which was relaxing after a day of touring there was also a large mall next door with a lot of shops and restaurants but the shops were closed due to the easter holiday
