lovely spacious room with a free minibar of drinks that was restocked daily very impressed by the shower that had many knobs to play around with had the sea view and what bliss it was to wake up to the sunrise every morning staff were very cheerful accommodating and extremely helpful location is away from the hustle and bustle of barcelona but it s near a metro station just mins away so it s easy to reach the tourist attractions in barcelona and near a beach and a park perfect if you want someplace quiet but also accessible additionally there s a huge mall next door perfect for some shopping and when i m feeling peckish for food my favourite stay in my europe trip
