we thoroughly enjoyed our stay all staff were polite and welcoming breakfast was amazing extensive variety our room had an amazing view floor we were greeted with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries it was also a minute walk from the beach and a second walk to the shopping centre tour bus stops right outside the hotel nearest station is across the road definitely recommend this hotel
