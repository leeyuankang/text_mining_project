fabulous hotel we had a fancy room with impressive city views the button controlled blinds were a dream come true the room would get pitch black and allowed us to sleep in staff here are wonderful we checked out of the hotel at midday since they were unable to accomodate a late checkout but our flight was not until pm the hotel offered us the service of their luggage room and also said that we are welcome to use the showers in the gym they provided towels and shower gel etc the taxi rank is just outside the hotel and the metro is a min walk the metro ride to the gothic quarter las ramblas takes about mins and mins to barcelonetta beach we walked to a nearby beach about min walk this one was heaps nicer than barcelonetta
