breakfast was fantastic lots of choice good location close to metro stop and tram line hotel was clean and all the staff were very helpful our room was lovely with a great view overlooking the sea the rooftop pool was fantastic and although we didn t use the gym or sauna it looked great all the facilities were great although the hotel is little way out of the centre don t let this put you off as it is a great hotel right next door to a very large shopping centre and with bars and restaurants across the road
