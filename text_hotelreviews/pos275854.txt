i was extremely impressed for the value as an english speaker the staff went above and beyond to accommodate me i had flown in from indonesia so upon checking in my bank froze my account in response to protect fraudulent charges this caused my card to come through as declined upon check in while many hotels would refuse me access to my room the hotel was more than understanding and let me check in get to my room and call my bank to release the hold in the room after a nearly hour flight it was a relief to come to a hotel room equipped with everything i needed razor toothpaste etc to shower and relax right away things i would traditionally need to run down to a store for i also loved how you use the hotel card to turn on the lights to conserve energy as a tourist having access to a free printer was an incredible perk dry cleaning and laundry was incredibly expensive but your drycleaning team was able to remove stains other dry cleaners had not while also turning it around much quicker than expected i didn t get to use the pool or gym but this is wonderful for the price location wish it was closer to the city but being right next to the mall amusement park and taxis at any hour was great for the price all of your staff seemed happy to help even when they did not speak english this is huge for a tourist who s trying to find their way around
