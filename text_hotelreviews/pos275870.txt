the bar staff were all lovely the room was clean every day with the free mini bar re stocked the hotel had a friendly feel and location was perfect with the shopping mall right next door with the outside restaurants open till late at night location to the center was further away however the metro was easy to navigate throughout the city both pool s were lovely with bartenders being very attentive although when its windy getting out of the pool was cold not the hotels fault obviously
