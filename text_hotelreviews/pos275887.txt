at first i was disappointed because i couldn t open the window to my room huge pet peeve of mine when staying at a hotel i asked if i could move or check out early then i was able to upgrade to a junior suite with an add on fee for the upgrade which i accepted and very glad i did the room was perfect with small balcony and amazing views it was a perfect stay
