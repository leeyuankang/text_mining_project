we were allowed to check in early the staff were amazingly friendly our room was huge had a beautiful view of the ocean viewing the sunrise from our room was simply unbelievable the shower was great the breakfast was lovely and had a huge selection of healthy and hot options the outdoor pool was gorgeous warm and stayed open until pm i was sick one night unfortunately and made it as far as the bin we called down to reception to ask could the bag be taken away not only was the lady sympathetic she sent up a member of staff immediately who was willing to clean up but we gratefully refused the staff for the most part could not have made us feel more welcome or been more helpful
