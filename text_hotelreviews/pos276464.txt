great hotel in good location next to the landmark torre gl ries and with the gl ries shopping mall just across the road buses trams and metro just a short walk and always an abundance of taxis which we found very reasonable particularly as there were four of us to share the fare great panoramic view of the city from our tenth floor room although our friends in room opposite didn t have that superb rooftop terrace
