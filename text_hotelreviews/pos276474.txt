the hotel is in a handy location with shops and takeaway restaurants nearby tram system is pretty easy to use too rooms were nice we stayed in a family room which had a double bed and sofa bed that was fine only the room itself was not very spacious little room to manoeuvre rooftop pool and terrace was beautiful
