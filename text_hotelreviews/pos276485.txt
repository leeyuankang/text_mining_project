overall this was a great hotel fantastic value and we would definitely stay here again but if you really want a family room book adjoining rooms we visited barcelona right before christmas with our and year olds we stayed in a family room which seemed like a normal double room with a smallish pullout sofa the main bed was very comfortable and the blackout shades kept the room dark breakfast was good with scrambled eggs fritatas sausage bacon pastries cereal yogurt fruit meats and cheese but the same everyday very few hotels we looked at in barcelona had breakfast included so this was a big bonus it is located about minutes walk from a metro that takes you straight downtown buy a trip card for euro rather than pay per trip there is a mall across the street with a big grocery store and some standard shops like zara and h m but nothing special there looked like a couple fast food places but little else for food in the area taxis were fairly cheap and there were always or right outside it was about euro to sagrada familia and euro to the airport we looked at a lot of hotels in the downtown area but all seemed risky for either quality or noise in this price range this was modern clean comfortable and convenient all at a great price
