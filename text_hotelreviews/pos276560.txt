we loved the rooftop terrace and pool we all loved being able to enjoy a fabulous view whilst relaxing in great comfort the staff were enormously helpful and the kids in particular enjoyed the buffet breakfast and kids area we loved that we were close enough to walk to many lovely places to eat and several attractions were within a more lengthy walk or short cab ride
