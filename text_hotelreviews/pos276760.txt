room was very nice big and clean the hotel itself is in a prime location with the tour bus route picking up from across the street there s a new shopping centre village in the process of being built but has gone quite a few finished units with plenty of places to eat there s also a big carrefour in this shopping village which is ideal for buying the odd bits and bobs you need if you ve forgotten anything the metro which is very very easy to use is only a short walk from the hotel too and makes for easy and quick access to las ramblas etc
