the hotel was well positioned for our visit to see our friends in poblenou the parking was difficult to find suggest giving information and directions during booking our room was upgraded to a club suite which was great unfortunately the shower and bath both leaked when using otherwise a very pleasant stay great view from the rooftop pool bar
