was nice to receive an upgrade the suite was nicely equipped although the airco didn t do it after our evening activity the room was like an oven also the tubes of the bathroom were not guiding the water away so taking a shower was like a pool not to speak of the hottub personnel was really nice and accommodating and the breakfast was yummy but very expensive per person
