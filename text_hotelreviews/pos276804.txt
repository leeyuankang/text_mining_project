the staff were really friendly and helpful the room was nice and modern with floor to ceiling windows everything felt comfortable and easy to navigate although we didn t eat in the restaurant we heard other guests saying great things about it location was good for exploring all corners of the city as it was fairly close to la sagrada familia so quite central but a bit far from the gothic district el born etc if you plan on walking everywhere we had inline skates also very close to a large shopping centre and bus rail stations as others have mentioned smelt really nice too
