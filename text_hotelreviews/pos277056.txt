the staff at this hotel were extremely helpful i came to visit barcelona for my boyfriends special birthday and i emailed the hotel asking if they could prepare some champagne for when we arrived when we arrived the champagne was waiting on ice for us along with some chocolate truffles and an amazing view a fantastic place to stay for a couple who are wanting a romantic weekend away will be highly recommending to other people
