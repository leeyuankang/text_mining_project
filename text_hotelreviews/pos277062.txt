the bed was comfortable and given the hotel is on a main road it is quiet and the breakfast was excellent and the staff are very helpful it is so easy to get around from this hotel with bus connections right outside the hotel including to the main train station connecting to other cities great cafes and restaurants nearby highly recommend
