it was the second time we visited barcelona so we were quite happy about the hotel s location easy access from the airport line and change to line diagonal we like walking in general so mins walk to metro station diagonal was not a problem at all hotel staff were really helpful during our stay we liked the effect our room was quietly sit on the floor and we were the only room on the left side of the building we also really like the large and comfy bed in our room
