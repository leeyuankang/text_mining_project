my friends and i had a very pleasant stay at the hotel the room was very clean and tidy location is very central with good transport links on the doorstep staff were very helpful when we asked for directions to places they were more than happy to help us breakfast had a fairly limited choice but we were more than happy with what we had i would recommend this hotel
