we had a very nice side view to avenida diagonal the room was very clean and on one day i left a note with a request for the maid and she was very nice and left me products we were in walking distance to el corte ingles so we could go to their supermarket and bring back what we bought easily the bus station was min away when we booked we made a request and the hotel actually took it in consideration others just tell you that you can ask for things at the hotel and of course most of the times they can t meet your demands as all the rooms are already booked great quality tv
