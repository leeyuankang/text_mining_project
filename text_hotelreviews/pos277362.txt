i loved this hotel the bed was the most comfortable bed i have even slept in the staff were incredibly kind and thoughtful they took the time to greet me when i returned to the hotel each day the breakfast put all other hotel breakfasts to shame it was phenomenal the hotel room itself was so beautifully designed i enjoyed the walk in shower the welcome drink and the impeccable cleanliness wow i literally want to live at this hotel if i m in barcelona again it s a no brainer as to where i ll be staying
