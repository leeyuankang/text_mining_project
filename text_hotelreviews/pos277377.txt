the staff were lovely and very helpful the rooftop bar and terrace had a great vibe and excellent views of the city we got a significant discount through booking com which made the room very good value for money room was luxurious shower was wonderful and we had a little balcony with a great view from the floor also meaning that the rooftop bar was just one flight of stairs from our room there were plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance coffee making facilities in the room complete with take away cups were very welcome when we left for the airport at
