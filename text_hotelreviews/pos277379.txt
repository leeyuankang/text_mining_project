the room was a large size and very well appointed the bed was large and comfy with plenty of pillows the bathroom was also large well appointed and with a separate toilet as we were lucky to receive an upgraded room we also had a private balcony with great views aircon worked well and was quiet we paid extra for breakfast on the rooftop which was well worth it a great start to the day
