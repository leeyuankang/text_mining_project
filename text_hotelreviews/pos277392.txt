staff were extremely friendly helpful and accomodating we paid extra for an early check in with a room upgrade bar man on the rooftop was very helpful and gave us complimentary snacks with our drinks which was great hotel was extremely clean location is good minute walk to the nearest metro station but the metro is easy to use which detracts from the walk we really enjoyed our stay
