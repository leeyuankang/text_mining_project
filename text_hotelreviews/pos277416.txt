we checked in here the day the hotel opened the hotel and facilities were great modern and clean the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful the room was spacious and had everything we needed we even had a sea view from our balcony the roof top terrace was a plus although the hotel is a bit off from most sites it is extremely easy to either walk or get taxis anywhere i would definitely stay here again when visiting barcelona
