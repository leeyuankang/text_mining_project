lovely hotel and the staff went the extra mile to make sure we had a great trip from upgrading our room to restaurant recommendations to adjusting our check out time to suit our flight home the hotel is mins from the city centre by metro making it perfect for a combined culture trip with chilled out days by the pool which was lovely and quiet the airport was mins along one metro line so we didn t feel the need to taxi would recommend and will return
