the large pool was great in the hot weather the adjoining restaurant the terrace is very pleasant and the food is good the staff did their utmost to please and were very friendly helpful and professional i really enjoyed the level of service offered the main bar is quite impressive my upgraded room had a great view and the classic room view was fine too a classic room appears to be a room that has not yet been upgraded however it was more than adequate for the price i had asked to be on an upper floor and this was not a problem this is a large conference hotel so there are large groups of business people who use the hotel and give it a lively atmosphere there is lovely large garden with shade and benches near the second pool proximity to the metro this large hotel is not located downtown but a short walk to the metro station gives you many bus choices as well as the opportunity to take the metro line straight to passeig de gracia i took the metro all over the city and often on the spur of the moment
