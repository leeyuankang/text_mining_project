i arrived early because i my plane landed a little earlier than expected and was allowed to check in about hours ahead of schedule the check in was very smooth if you are attending a conference in the university area this hotel is just a few minutes walk away from the campus buildings alternatively if you want to explore the city there is a metro station really close by that will allow you to access other parts of the city really quickly the hotel room itself was pretty large and clean with a very comfortable bed perfect for when traveling for business purposes
