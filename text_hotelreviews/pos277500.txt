i stayed at this hotel for the time recently with the group of friends parents with children enjoying both the quality of the hotel and its location this time i was alone with my o son in general we had a great father son weekend though mainly out of the hotel the expected quality of the hotel was supposed to match the convenience related to watching the fc barcelona game location is still its best feature the hotel has unfortunately changed since we stayed here some time ago
