situated just minutes from the airport this hotel has stunning views of barcelona from the upper rooms from our room we had a panoramic view of the barcelona fc stadium national museum of art the olympic stadium the airport and all the way to the mediteranean sea we even were treated to a nightly fireworks show all rooms are accessible via internal hallways that open to the lobby below our room on the floor was modern and nicely appointed the entire facility was new and very well maintained the staff could not have been more accommodating or nicer to work with room service was prompt and very professional the food was excellent try the club sandwich or penne pasta we d had plenty of tapas while touring and wanted something more familiar there are plenty of elevators that operate quickly to get you from the upper floors to the lobby area and back two of them give you a view of the expansive lobby as it climbs to your floor this is an excellent location for touring the city taxis are lined up hours a day easy traveling to all the top sight seeing destinations within minutes we felt safe on and around the grounds not any traffic noise as this hotel isn t located in the super busy tourist area even if the nightly rate is slightly more than other options in barcelona give this hotel a try we didn t see any other hotel in or around the city we wish we d have chosen instead
