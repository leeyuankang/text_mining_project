we were a grandmother and grandson travelling around europe together and our stay at this hotel was exceptional there is nothing that did not please us the staff were exceptional polite courteous attentive and considerate the hotel room was perfect and large and clean the pools were terrific and we can not say enough good reports it is ideally located within two minutes walk from the metro that takes one straight into the heart of the city it is about a twenty minute ride by metro to the city centre the hotel is airy and whilst it is clearly designed for families in mind this was not a problem regarding a noise element the pool area was large and the playground for small children more than enough the weather was perfect and we cannot wait to return
