i loved this place the hotel grounds are huge and a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city we chose this place purely because of the location and size two amazing pools and an incredible gym the staff were amazing the check in process was fast everything was easy i m definitely coming back catching the metro is so easy too just up the road and you are in the city in less than this is the perfect hotel in barcelona spend the day having fun in the city then retreat back to your quiet hotel full of cool things to do
