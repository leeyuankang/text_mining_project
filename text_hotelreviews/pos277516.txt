the staff were extremely helpful and unobtrusive frank on the concierge desk was especially helpful advising which sites it would be a good idea to book tickets for in advance the hotel has an beautiful lobby and lounge and the room we stayed in was extremely quiet which certainly can t be said of another supposedly star we stayed at recently we stayed in one of the refurbished rooms overlooking the city towards the sea which again was faultless and had efficient and quiet air conditioning
