my wife and i stayed in barcelona for our honeymoon where we stayed at fairmont rey juan carlos hotel the room was absolutely fantastic great view very spacious very large comfortable king bed and a very nice and comfy living room in the double executive room the staff were extremely friendly and sent us a bottle of champagne and a large desert complimentary when they found out we were on honeymoon and were very pleasant and professional throughout the pool and gym facility were really nice and with a very nice garden and restaurant outside location was a bit of a distance from the sea and city centre but the nice and quoted surrounding was nice in the evenings and anyway so the metro station is just min walk outside the hotel and in no more than mins you will be in downtown for a very low cost on the metro also for those of us who are football fans the hotel is a short walking distance from the nou camp stadium overall very satisfied in this luxurious trendy and comfortable hotel and would definitely highly recommend it
