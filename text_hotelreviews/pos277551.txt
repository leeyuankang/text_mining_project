i came to barcelona for a conference and the site of our congress was a convenient walk from the hotel the room was clean and the staff were great they had a map of a running route that went through the university that was fun they also gave some great recommendations for restaurants also i need to receive a package via post and it was delivered while i was there and was waiting in my room there is also a recreation center next door less than one minute that was quite pleasant also if you re there for business the wireless works i didn t have much luck at other hotels in barcelona with their wifi all in all it was great experience
