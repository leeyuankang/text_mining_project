the hotel is literally mins away from barceloneta beach the location is really really convenient also mins away from ciutadella metro so getting about was really easy all staffs were really helpful and friendly we came to barcelona to celebrate my partner s birthday and the hotel experience was amazing on the second day we walked into our room with a short birthday message complimentary bottle of champagne and a cake for my partner i can certainly say that our trip to barcelona was better than expected because of our stay at pullman highly recommended
