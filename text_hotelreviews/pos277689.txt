we stayed two nights in pullman skipper the hotel has a great location which is just beside the port olympic taking a early morning walk to enjoy the tranquility is such easy thing to play on the beach and enjoy the sunshine is not difficult either given the hotel s proximity to go the la rambla and treat yourself to the great seafood in la baqueria is very easy just taking bus in front of the hotel minutes you will be there in the busiest street of barcelona the room is spacious and with heater in the bathroom so anything being washed it could be dried within hours with the heater a special door is kindly incorporated into the inner decoration which ensures sound proof of the bedroom which is very considerate there s swimming pool on the ground floor and rooftop bar lounge restaurant on the ground floor in order to get to the barcelona sants railway station take the bus no in front of the hotel and it s super convenient
