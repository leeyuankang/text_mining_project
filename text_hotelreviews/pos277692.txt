the staff were very accommodating and friendly left us to enjoy the place and gave us some space the rooftop pool was beautiful and very relaxing the food in the restaurant was impeccable and the room given to us for the two days was spotless and we enjoyed the comfortable bed and the large tv was a great addition to the room there were available travel adapters from the main reception so if you are stuck for one it wouldn t be a problem the hotel is a walking distance to the casino restaurants the beach and other entertainment areas
