our aim was to have a relaxing seaside holiday and that s exactly what we got hotel itself slightly more business orientated that i expected but an excellent accommodation nevertheless for everyone i guess people only tend to sleep in the hotel while in this beautiful city anyway rooftop pool is beautiful the location of the hotel couldn t be better at the beach but also within walking distance to town if you like walking the taxi costs less than to the centre tip although the beach promenade is extremely enjoyable it ll be a hot in the summer and much longer walk to town than walking along the main road from the hotel entrance
