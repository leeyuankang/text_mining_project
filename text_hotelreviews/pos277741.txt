this is a really great hotel in the heart of the action next to the puerto olimpico the rooms are beautifully appointed and the beds extremely comfortable two lovely pools one on the roof terrace which also has a great bar and views the breakfast buffet is extraordinarily good and a great patio area by the pool but for me the outstanding feature of the hotel is its staff very attentive polite and well organised a pleasure to deal with and any issues were addressed immediately and without fuss will definitely stay there again
