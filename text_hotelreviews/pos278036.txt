the staff at the hotel were amazing from the moment we got there to the moment we left very helpful and spoke english very well as it was our first time in barcelona the man behind the reception gave us helpful information on which metro s to get where and a map of barcelona we got a smaller room than we were supposed to because we wanted to check in early but this was still a great size and was immaculate air conditioning in the room was great and so was the free wifi which was available anywhere in the hotel there is a metro stop right outside the hotel which was great when travelling to the gothic quarter and a lovely bakery right next door i would definitely recommend this hotel
