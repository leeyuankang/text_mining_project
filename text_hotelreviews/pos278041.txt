fantastic location with clot metro station just around the corner room was clean cool and comfortable fantastic shower bathroom facilities and a comfy bed at night unfortunately we were next to a room of younger visitors who were happy to make as much noise as possible during all hours of the night however we can not praise the hotel staff enough for dealing with this issue promptly and professionally
