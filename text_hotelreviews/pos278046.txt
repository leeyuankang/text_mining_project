the rooms were modern clean and comfortable with two double beds the rooftop pool is small but the terrace area is large enough to sunbathe with fantastix views of the city the hotel is close to the metro train links and only a few stops to the main attractions and the beach the staff are very friendly and helpful overall great stay would definitely stop again
