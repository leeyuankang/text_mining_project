when we got there everything looked and seemed great we arrived early and they gladly took in our luggage while we returned our rental car and came back later in the afternoon we checked in and went to the room it was the nicest room ever the kids were super happy instaled in their bunker beds and then things went wrong the air conditioning stopped working and we went to complain in the front desk so they told us that they would send somebody to look it up over than half an hour later someone came to our room spent minutes with the air conditioning and told us to wait some minutes to see if it would start to cool down the room if not we should call back the front desk for the maintenance person to come it didn t get better obviously they had a answer ready all the times we went down to complain and to try to get it fixed but actually we came to realize they were doing nothing only waiting for the night come and there would have not another solutions and the maneger would not be in so it happened we ended up with a incredibly hot and moist room after the showers we took to cool down we went to talk in the front desk again the night shift guy couldn t help us at all the best he could do was offer us a fan a single fan to cool down a large room that a broken air conditioning couldn t we spent a night in hell and with a fan to remedy the problem next morning at nine o clock when the manager came in and we thought we would change rooms immediately they didn t have one ready for us they were waiting for us to tell them if we wanted it or not when we said that we wanted it right away they were not sure if the air conditioning was working properly in the new room and they need time to make sure or so they told us that so we packed our bags and got everything ready for when the new room would be ready so then the staff would make the switch and later when we came back to the hotel it would be all perfect
