rooms are compact but modern and very clean just what you want for a city break we had a room with a balcony on the tenth floor which was fantastic to sit out on in the evenings with a cold beer ac in the room worked very well which i appreciated as the weather was blisteringly hot hotel staff were pleasant and helpful everyone bar the cleaners seemed to have excellent english although we were out and about too much to really use any of the communal facilities the rooftop pool and lounge area was very clean and tidy the views from the rooftop area are stunning the location isn t overly central but there is a metro station less than from the front door and with trains every minutes you can be at las ramblas in minutes bonus there is a bakery right next to the hotel with fresh baguettes pastries cold drinks etc perfect for throwing in your bag on the way to the metro
