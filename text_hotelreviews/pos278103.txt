the whole experience of our trip to barcelona and the hotel was perfect i can not speak highly enough of everyone who made our stay so special our room was lovely and clean with a fantastic shower and huge comfy bed we spent time in the spa and on the roof terrace which has spectacular views over the city very close to the metro so getting about was easy i will return here i hope sometime in the future
