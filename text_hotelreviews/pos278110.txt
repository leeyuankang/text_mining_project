we never used fitness center at the hotell instead we did walking daily discovering the city hotell has excellent location with access to nearby shoping also public transport such as metro goes around the corner of hotell it takes some minutes of walking to get to the old town to ramble street catedral or to the sea beach we highly recommend the hotell
