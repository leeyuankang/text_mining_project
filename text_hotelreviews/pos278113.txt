i stayied once at catalonia atenas and the second time i went they had a small problem with some rooms and they moved me to another hotel of the chain very close to planza catalunya they provided a taxi transfer for me and were super quick and super nice also gave me a welcome flute while i was waiting both hotels are extra comforable staff super nice and the food excellent love the huge breakfast buffet and the spa
