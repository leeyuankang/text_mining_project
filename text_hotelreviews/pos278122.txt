easy to use the metro line stop clot to get around town staff was very helpful with calling taxis giving recommendations for dinner and so on the roof has a great view and a nice place to play cards or relax before going to dinner we had breakfast at the cafe next door or down the road so no comment on how the food was at the hotel lobby bar was nice
