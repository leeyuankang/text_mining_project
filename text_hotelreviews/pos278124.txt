the property was in a great location there is a bakery next door with cheap breakfast i would go there before i paid for breakfast at the hotel though the hotel was clean looked very classy and the rooms were super spacious for being in europe i was impressed when we walked in the room they also had larger tubs which was nice for a bubble bath after a long day they also gave us free drinks at the bar upon check in
