the experience here was great very easy access the metro is across the street the rooms are confortable breakfast is great both in diversity and taste price was eur if you buy it at reception for me the most important thing was the staff we meet a lady there geanina she sent choclate to our room the first night we got not only maps but a book with details about what to visit in barcelona umbrellas as our first day was rainy and raincoats we got great support on all our questions we even got free complimentary breakfst it sounds to nice i know it does but that was the truth it was really a nice place to stay bar was cool the overall feeling from other guests was nice i will use it again and recommand it to everybody traveling to barcelona
