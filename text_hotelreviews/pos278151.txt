the location of the property is really nice especially if you tend to visit torre agbar neighborhood or sagrada familia staff is really friendly and tend to help you in case you need it the breakfast is decent but if you are not used to diversity of tastes and types of food for the breakfast then you can have it in some other place for half of the price or even cheaper really enjoyed that hotel read my booking remark and gave a room with a nice view as i asked
