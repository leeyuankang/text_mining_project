me and my partner stayed here for our anniversary and the hotel added a special little touch with a cake and two welcome drink tickets which was a lovely little touch the staff were very helpful check in was fast and easy had a lovely room on level the breakfast was very nice a lot of choice from hot and cold the spa was very relaxing and the staff in the spa made it even better overall i would definitely recommend this hotel
