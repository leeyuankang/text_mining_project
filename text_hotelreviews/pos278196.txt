whilst the hotel is lovely and conveniently located next to the clot metro station which is on the main line we booked the hotel as it was advertised as a spa hotel when we checked in we weren t told to book into the spa and just to pop down when we did we found that there is only space for people in the spa as there are only loungers so we didn t get a chance to use it which was disappointing as was one of the main reasons for booking the room was also very small and you couldn t walk around the bed
