the size of the room was really good and i enjoyed that there were double doors opening out to a seating area which added more space the sushi was great it was easy to commute as the metro station is across the street taxi from the marina around am was around euro la sagrada familia is close by the view from roof by the pool is excellent of the city there s a computer with printer free for guests to use in the lobby which came in handy
