the buffet breakfast was gorgeous and the staff were very friendly my partner is fluent spanish but i m not and they recognised and remembered this detail for our long weekend and also remembered how we preferred to pay for things the atmosphere in the bar was chilled and the wine went down too easily the view from the roof by the pool is very pretty and it s opposite the metro and also very near the station that goes straight to the airport will definitely recommend and stay again if we visit barcelona again
