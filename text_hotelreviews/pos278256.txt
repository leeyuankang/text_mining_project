we loved the location of this hotel min walk from sagrada familia and very close to a metro station so ideal location perfect size room for adults and two teenagers beautiful bathroom and really well decorated excellent views from the roof top pool which was a hit with our teenagers spa was excellent and the gym was well kitted out we would definitely stay here again
