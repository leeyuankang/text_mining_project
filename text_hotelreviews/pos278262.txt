amazing location just outside the hotel there is a metro station so you can go to any place in the city within minutes nice bathroom even have amazing bakery just next door if you don t want to pay ridiculously high price for breakfast amazing solution didn t try breakfast in the hotel costs more then a dinner in the center but with quality of the bakery i bet it would be worse anyway
