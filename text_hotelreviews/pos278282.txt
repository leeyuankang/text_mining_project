to begin with i will say that the hotel is average but when i use the term average its because there were a couple of things that need to be considered if someone would like to stay it doesn t mean that its bad the staff were helpful and nice the room i got was bigger than the one my father stayed in so that was a concern its good for me but not good for my father also my father received a tea set and i didn t i pay attention to detail a lot the people i didn t use but it was really small nothing too exciting the elevators were slow and need some updating i liked how there were free apples that s a very healthy initiatives there is one bakery down the hotel there are a few random restaurants by the hotel nothing can be found within walking distance you could reach avenue diagonal i would say it would be a walk not too bad but to the hotel nothing is really close by the bed was comfortable it would have been better if i got a queen size instead of a double bed if its a last resort option and if the prices suit you its an okay hotel nothing to impressive its clean hotel the noise level is not bad very quiet and very well kept
