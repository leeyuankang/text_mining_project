the hotel was comfortable and the staff were very friendly the food in the restaurant was also lovely as was the sangria the service was great and the rooms were very clean we even received a complimentary drink on arrival because i d stated in our booking that we were a newly engaged couple we also got a double bed and a high floor room which was what i requested our room had a fridge which was great and the bakery next door was open hours so we were able to buy water and breakfast things to have in the room there weren t any tea or coffee making facilities unfortunately and as coffee lovers we would have appreciated that little extra
