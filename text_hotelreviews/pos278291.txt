very close to the metro station and so quick to get to the centre warm welcome by the receptionists at all times and i got a quick brief with map on how to get to everything too in the evening the balcony at the top with the swimming pool is a must although the pool was small it was quiet up there and i watched the sunset from my lounger could see an incredible view of the city from there
