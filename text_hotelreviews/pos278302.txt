this hotel had a good location close to the metro and train links there was a good little bakery next to the hotel which we visited for coffee and croissants each morning check in was quick and santiago was great giving us some tips on where to go with the kids we had a family room which was very spacious and had proper beds for the kids the decent sized fridge was an added bonus the pool was small but clean and big enough for the kids to have a quick swim each morning we didn t use the restaurant or spa so can t comment on those overall we were impressed with this hotel and had no concerns or complaints
