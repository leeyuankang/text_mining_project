what a fabulous trip from the minute we walked in the desk staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming the car park was fully booked when we arrived but we were provided clear simply direction to a near by alternative and upon our return to the catalonia atenas were given vouchers for a free drink each to make up for this minute inconvenience it was entirely unexpected and immediately made us feel like valued guests the room was excellent too immaculate and comfortable the free wi fi was easy to access and worked perfectly for both of us the whole time though our usage was not extensive not to be out done by reception the bar staff were friendly and could not do enough to help extremely attentive but not intrusive as a side note the tapas served in the bar was very tasty indeed check out the asparagus the rooftop pool is small but nice we enjoyed our brief splish the real bonus here though is that the seating lounging area around it gives fantastic views over this part of the city with sagrada familia so close this is a great spot for photo ops overall we were bowled over by our stay in the catalonia atenas it ticked very single box good food great atmosphere a metro station directly adjacent and only stops to la rambla courteous and helpful staff and very comfortable clean rooms not only would i recommend to others it will be my first port of call next time i m in barcelona
