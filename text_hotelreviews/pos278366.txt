cool hotel helpful staff and hotel is close to train stations the bus is right out th front door the hotel rooms are a bit small but i m a solo traveler so it was fine my room was on the second floor street side i could barely hear the traffic windows are double pained your given two card keys to get in i suggest you leave one in the power switch which turns on the refrigerator and keeps the ac going if you remove it everything will turn off especially when your trying to keep cold drinks in the fridge and the ac going all night the staff is very friendly and most speak english and everybody that works there are very helpful and nice there s a hotel restaurant which a good place to eat a little pricey depending on what your hungry for open late and opens early there are plenty of places to eat near by if your willing to walk around and explore
