lovely hotel in an ideal location for both the metro and train station some nice bars and restaurants nearby so you don t have to travel if you don t want the hassle very friendly and accommodating staff the rooftop pool was a bonus for relaxing and getting a good tan a good tip for both the metro and train is to buy a ticket which gets you journeys on both of these and can be used for more than one person costs approx euros so excellent value
