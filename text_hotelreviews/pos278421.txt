the staff at this hotel were all friendly welcoming and knowledgable the location is a little out of the centre but it is easy to travel in by metro or taxi and it is quiet at night so it s easy to sleep the spa and the roof top pool are fantastic and there are lots of areas to chill out in and get a snack or drink i d recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality hotel that isn t directly in the busy tourist area
