the staff was phenomenal from the receptionist at the front desk to the staff at the spa to the night manager who helped us print our boarding pass everyone was friendly and helpful our room was roomy spotless and had a great view of the city the rooftop pool would be perfect for summer the spa while small was perfect and the staff limits the number of people by reservation so it s not overcrowded massage services are fantastic and very reasonably priced great location near the clot metro stop and there is a little bakery convenience store open next door to the hotel if you cant find what you need in the lobby vending machines flawless wifi as well
