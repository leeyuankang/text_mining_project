we chose a premium room which was nicely presented the bed was very comfortable however our room seemed to be near a water outlet for the hotel and from am each day there was a regular sound of rushing water i assume people having showers etc which was disturbing on the plus side the spa is very good and for the most part the staff are very nice the breakfast is excellent
