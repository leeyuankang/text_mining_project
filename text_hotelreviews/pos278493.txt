the lovation of the hotel was quite good it was right next to clot station and was very easy to access the meain locations of barcelona without being too close to everything staff were very friendly and helpful and the soa was absolutely lovely it really didnt seam to fit the rest of the hotel in terms of design would definitely reccomend a visit to the spa the aircon also worked very well the view from the top of the hotel was lovely you could see the whole of barcelona beauiful
