breakfast was great and really good value for euro part of time attended a conference at hotel and lunches were fabulous really creative tapas type stuff staff are lovely and helpful location super short walk to la rambla or waterfront and going the other way a short walk to a pedestrian street with many blocks of tapas restaurants
