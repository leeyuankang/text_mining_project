we arrived in barcelona days before our cruise departure we chose this hotel because of its location to the cruise terminal it is about a minute walk to the water and a taxi to the cruise terminal it is also located within a short walk to the gothic area the metro stop is just a few minutes walk from the front door and was very easy to use to get around the city the staff was very friendly and helpful we are a family of with teenage children so they were able to accommodate us with a triple and double room right next to each other we asked for rooms at the back of the hotel so it would be quieter during the busy night hours the buffet breakfast was great as others recommended i too suggest you purchase the breakfast it is a great start to your day
