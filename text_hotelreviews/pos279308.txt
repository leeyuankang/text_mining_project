our room was comfortable and quiet it was close to the olympic stadium for the concert our daughter was attending and an easy safe walking distance the a level lounge where we could have tapas and a glass of wine was most appreciated after a long and hot day of touring as were the very knowledgeable and helpful staff who manned it during our stay
