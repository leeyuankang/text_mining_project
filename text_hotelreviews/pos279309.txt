this hotel is located in fira which might be considered to be slightly far off from the centre itself which is las ramblas i only stayed here for a night and loved exploring everything they had in the area the magic fountain was a minute walk from the property and so were many sights you would love to walk around the arenas mall was also just a minute walk great to grab a bite to eat or to shop
