the view was amazing and the room was very clean and nice and cool during the heat wave the location was great for us we walked to camp nou and rented bikes to get to the beach and we cycled up to the olympic stadium we didn t go on one of those bike tours as we felt they were over expensive for what we did for each on a bike and found our own way
