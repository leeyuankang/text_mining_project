hotel was lovely staff super helpful we were there for the grand prix and travel to the race track was made much easier due to location of hotel once we paid to upgrade to the suite it was very nice a couple of little niggles like door not staying closed to the bathroom and tech could do with an upgrade but nothing that would make us even slightly bothered
