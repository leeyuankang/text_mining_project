location only minutes from the station very convenient if you are catching a train early in the morning rooms are very comfortable and there is an excellent place to have breakfast in the morning with lovely views of barcelona expensive but great choice available it is cheaper if you have three breakfasts nice comfortable lounge bar for a night cap staff at all levels were helpful and polite
