rooms are spacious and very comfortable view of the city from the rooms was lovely staff is welcoming and friendly bathrooms are very big and supply of hot water is very good the hotel gives a very comfortable feel the rooftop restaurant has great views over the city we did not try the food at the restaurant so cannot comment location wise if you have to take the high speed train there is nothing more convenient the sant train station is next door tot he hotel but if you want to explore the gothic quarters and la ramblas which are the main happening places in barcelona the same are a bit away the cab takes about euros one way metro station is also next door so the hotel is convenient that way the hop on hop off service also has a bus stop next door cab is readily available at all the hours barcelona is a great city with vibrant nightlife i split my stay this time between torre catalunya and another hotel on la ramblas just to be within the main gothic quarter overall a great place to stay
