this is a great business hotel it is run very efficiently the reception desk seems focused on quick service to prevent long customer lines the bar area is very nice and restricted to guests so it allows for casual business meetings it also has a very nice outside patio area the hotel is a minute walk from the sants train station many rooms on the higher floors have a nice view of the city
