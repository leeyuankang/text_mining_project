amazing views from our corner suite on the floor booked to celebrate our ruby wedding anniversary there was a so much space we could have easily lived there very comfortably panoramic views from both bedroom and living room beds and pillows were super comfy as was the sofa in the living room was worth paying extra to get this experience hotel had decorated our bed with rose petals and provided us with a glass of bubbly and chocolates along with a congratulatory note a lovely touch staff in hotel were very friendly and polite our anniversary meal in the panoramic restaurant on the floor was perfect food was beautiful and waiting staff were attentive without being intrusive hotel is in a perfect location with easy access to the train station and metro would recommend buying a ticket overall a perfect way to celebrate our ruby anniversary in a lovely hotel in a beautiful city would definitely stay at this hotel again
