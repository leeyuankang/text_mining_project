our hotel was amazing as you walked into the hotel it smelt nice and we re very welcoming and spoke good english view from our hotel was amazing staff very friendly and helpful with directions and knowing good places to eat couldn t fault anything in the room it was spacious nice a quiet so didn t get disturbed when sleeping or relaxing bathrooms were great too very big to be able to fit two people in the shower as well as the bath and you even had two sinks and at the end of our stay we still had the whole day to look around meaning we didn t have anywhere to put our luggage and the staff looked after it for us until we needed to pick it up which was a huge help for us the location of the hotel was good to as it was a two minute walk from the train station
