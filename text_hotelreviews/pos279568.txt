the hotel was right next to the barcelona sants train station and across the street from the sants metro station so it was very conveniently located the rooftop restaurant had a fabulous view and it was a pleasure to have breakfast there each morning the coffee was the best i had while in spain and the breakfast buffet had many food selections the room was spacious and exceptionally clean
