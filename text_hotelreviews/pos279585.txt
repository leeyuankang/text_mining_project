staff were helpful and friendly the restaurant is a must to visit we were apprehensive as it wasn t on our agenda as not really part of cultural trip but the food was fantastic i can definitely recommend the gorgonzola and pear sacchetti cleaner came every day and replenished toiletries and towels as requested overall a perfect stay in a fab location near the saints station which gives access to many lines all over barcelona and to the airport
