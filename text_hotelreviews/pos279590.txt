location is right next to main station but does mean you have to get the metro in for anything all meals etc this was a bit of a pain some nights especially when we were tired after a long day of sightseeing and couldn t get any decent meals locally neighbourhood seems more business focused would probably stay closer to gothic quarter in future to get that barcelona charm room was great well worth paying extra for the suites with panoramic views
