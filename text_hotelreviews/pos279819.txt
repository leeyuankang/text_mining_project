we booked the hotel last minute and were happy with our choice we chose it because we liked the look of the outside relaxation areas the pool was as described a plunge pool so not deep enough to actually swim and unheated so chilly in april no complaints though we used the sunbeds when we returned from sightseeing and it was warm enough to sit outside just what we wanted we thought the hotel clean and comfortable and the staff generally helpful but not over welcoming the breakfast was good full english was available with fruits cereal pastries cheese and meat so enough to keep you going for most of the day we hired bikes for four days and were able to store them in the car park below the hotel safely behind an automatic gate there is a supermarket next door if you need to pick up any provision and the sants station five minutes away has lots of food outlets and a tourist information head to placa d osca for authentic tapas frequented by the locals
