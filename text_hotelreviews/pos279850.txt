i liked that the hotel was so close to the barcelona sans train station which allowed us to get to wherever in the city pretty fast we had a complaint about our bedroom after the first night as the bed was so creaky which made it difficult to sleep we asked to change rooms the next morning which was ok with the staff we asked if we could pay more for a superior room instead however the hotel upgraded us to one of the superior rooms with no extra cost this was great customer service and made our impressions of the hotel go up a lot the jacuzzi on the rooftop was a nice addition after a long day of sightseeing while the superior room had a huge bed and seemed like a different hotel from the standard bedroom
