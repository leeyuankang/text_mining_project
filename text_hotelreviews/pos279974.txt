i have absolutely no faults with this hotel the receptionist was the most accommodating we could not have asked for better service from the staff all staff were very friendly and spoke good english the area was somewhat quiet construction was taking place next door public transport was very easy to find use around the site we weren t too far from the city center beach we would definitely return to this hotel and recommend to any friends and family looking to travel to barcelona thank you for making our stay so memorable
