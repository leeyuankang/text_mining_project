the hotel was beautifully decorated staff at the pool bar were excellent especially yam who made a real effort to make us laugh very attentive drinks were a great price for a bottle of prosecco we thought was a bargain and the cocktail of the day for was great too beer was only location was a short walk to the main train station and there were lots of good restaurants nearby we mostly used taxis to get to the main part of town because we were a group and it was only a ride away but i think the underground was only a short walk and a bus stopped straight outside we also got the tourist bus from the train station which was handy
