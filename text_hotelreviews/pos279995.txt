excellent staff members on the desk who are very helpful hotel was clean and rooms were tidied up very well every day beds were comfy and the bathroom was modern and tidy air conditioning worked really well terrace bar was great it had beer on draught and also served great cocktails there was also a good comprehensive room menu which i did not try location is ok but will require walking about to the nearest metro station or to decent restaurants not a problem for my family as we enjoy walking all in all an excellent hotel i would definitely stay here again
