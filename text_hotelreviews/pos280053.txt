upon arrival at the hotel check in was very quick our rooms were clean but were a bit small the hotel doesn t have a pool and does charge extra for the spa but that didn t bother us as we spent a lot of time outside of the hotel enjoying the sights in barcelona the location of the hotel is a bit out of town but there are plenty of taxis around that will charge you euros for a trip into the center of the city overall the hotel is good vale for money and offers an excellent service the breakfast is nice and the staff within the hotel are very friendly and helpful
