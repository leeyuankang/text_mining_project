location was good staff very helpful parked the car for us underground though it was euros for but hey central barcelona the bar on the ground floor was really pleasant and comfortable we had delicious tapas for lunch best ever meatballs with squid eggs and ham and potatoes so tasty the room we had was lovely with a great city view all in all we loved it just would have liked executive level i think barcelona was very busy at the time so the price reflected that
