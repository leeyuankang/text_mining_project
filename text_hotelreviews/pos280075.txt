the room was lovely the bathtub with bubble jets was amazing the hotel was a bit out from the centre but nice area with many beautiful restaurants nearby restaurants around the hotel were higher quality more reasonably priced and less touristy than the centre the staff were only too happy to recommend places to eat and how to get around the metro is very efficient easy to use and quick to get around the city closest station at hospital clinic was about minutes walk from the hotel plenty of nice caf s on the way to the metro where we had croissants and coffee for breakfast high quality hotel at very reasonable price
