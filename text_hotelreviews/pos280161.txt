in general the service was great the room was beautiful the bed was so comfortable the rain forest shower was incredibly relaxing the two way mirrors were fun the water left your skin feel really soft the wine at the restaurant was outstanding the room service food was tasty including a wonderful gormet breakfast and the chocolate truffles were delicious the hotel is well placed for getting into the mountains and there are good and easy transport connections to central barcelona overall a very nice romantic experience
