this grand hotel is a peaceful oasis in the midst of tourist filled square fantastic location right across from cathedral our room had view open balcony doors allowed us to enjoy lovely live music from below yet soundproof glass kept noise to minimum at night spa was very nice but disappointing in that steam room was closed due to malfunction on both days there
