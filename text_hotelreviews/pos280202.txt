the location was amazing right across from the cathedral on the edge of the gothic quarter not to be missed is the spectacular view from the floor observation deck with beverage service from the hotel bar the recently renovated room was spacious and comfortable with a great shower the staff was very friendly and helpful anxious to please and very professional if you arrive by car there is an extremely convenient underground public parking garage meters from the hotel s door and the rambla is only a short walk away altogether a memorable place to stay
