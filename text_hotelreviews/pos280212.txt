i booked a single room which was not too small and was cutely comfortable my window opened on to the street at the back of the hotel letting in fresh air and the sounds of the cathedral bells and young people staying at the hostel across the narrow street i liked that it was not too noisy i slept very well my view was of rooftops but that was fine i was on the fourth floor lower than that it might have been more of an issue the staff was friendly and helpful in all ways and spoke english to me when necessary they worked to get me a room early when my flight arrived at am the location could not have been better for me on the plaza across from the cathedral in the immensely walk able gothic neighborhood i loved it
