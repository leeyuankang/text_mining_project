the location is superb right in front of the cathedral the room was excellent with a little balcony through french doors facing the cathedral i arrived around am and i was able to check my luggage put my valuables in the hotel safe and go sightseeing until after lunch when my room was ready hotel staff advised us of marathon sunday morning and arranged for our taxi to the airport very early to avoid the shutdown of the streets everyone was very gracious and helpful i didn t get a chance to check out the spa so i can t comment on it but seems nice to have wi fi is good
