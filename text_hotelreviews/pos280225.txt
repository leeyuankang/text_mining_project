this is a charming traditional hotel so if you re looking for modern this isn t the hotel for you i liked the hc monogrammed towels sheets and pillowcases and blanket rather than duvet the staff were helpful our room was on the fourth floor with small balcony overlooking the cathedral so the view was magnificent see photo and there are many restaurants within walking distance
