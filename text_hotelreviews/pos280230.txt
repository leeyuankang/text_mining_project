location couldn t be better if you d like to shop and sightsee too staff is polite and very helpfull for instance we got a scale to check the weight of our luggage most of rooms have view to the catedral square in front of hotel is quite crowded notwinthstanding our room was quiet we had a balcony like the room itself it was very clear aswell on the is a spa with the same amazing view to catedral both sauna and steam was warm enough for me perfect hotel itself is a litlebit oldstyle except the small spa on the top hotels could be happy with similar it reflects in price so very good value for money next time i go to barcelona i will check this hotel s availability at first
