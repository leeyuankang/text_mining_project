the location on cathedral square opposite barcelona cathedral is amazing every afternoon there was a high quality musician playing violin or classical guitar and on friday a small orchestra playing for folk dancers our room had a nice terrace but it was at the back of the building overlooking rooftops however it was a nice place to relax in the late afternoon sun before going out for dinner our room was spacious and quiet and staff were very helpful in giving directions to various activities and sites outside the area
