our room overlooked the square with a view of the cathedral it was magical beds very comfortable bathroom very clean and the shower was amazing i loved it for me there are no negatives and i am very picky when it comes to hotel rooms you do pay a little more than other hotels but it is worth every penny if you expect high standards
