the location is amazing right across from the cathedral the staff was extremely helpful and very friendly they keep your key when you leave the hotel so it s one less thing to think about keeping track of while you re out exploring beautiful barcelona upon returning to the hotel tapas and cocktails are available in the restaurant bar or the terrace area the view from the terrace is gorgeous so i d recommend that option as there is no view in the bar the tapas aren t that special but the view improves them if you re especially hungry there are countless delicious options steps from the hotel
