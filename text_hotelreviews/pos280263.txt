we stayed at the hotel colon in mid july and found the location to be wonderful barcelona is a large city but this hotel was a perfect location for almost anything you walk out of the hotel and you are in front of the cathedral we had a a room with a little balcony that looked out over the square and cathedral which was just perfect the room itself was charming and clean the food in barcelona is amazing if you need to catch a taxi they are right down the street but again location is great if you re willing to walk and explore staff was very helpful and friendly would recommend to anyone who wants to experience the charms of barcelona
