the hotel is right in the centre of the old town facing the cathedral we had a quiet double room facing the back the view from the window was not good but this wasn t a problem the shower was very good the wardrobe had plenty of hangers the air conditioning was good the reception and the bar staff were polite and efficient the room as well as the public space of the hotel seems to have been recently redecorated
