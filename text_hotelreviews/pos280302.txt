this is the second time i have stayed at the colon and i will definitely be coming back the location is fabulous the staff friendly and attentive and the views from the rooms located on the front of the hotel allocated on my first stay are wonderful another guest complained about the wifi reception in his room which was next to mine but i could not fault it my devices worked perfectly
