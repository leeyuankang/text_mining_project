we stayed at the hotel colon for two nights to celebrate my boyfriend s birthday we booked a room on the sixth floor with a private terrace we arrived on our first night at sunset and were met with an unforgettable view of barcelona cathedral directly across the square the room was comfortable and well appointed with a large walk in closet the terrace however was fabulous we also took advantage of the modern rooftop pool and the steam room and sauna they were stylish clean and well maintained and afforded dynamic views the location is downright amazing the view phenomenal and the staff were friendly attentive and helpful although the decor of the hotel lobby and our room was a bit dated it was not one bit shabby our stay was nothing short of perfect
