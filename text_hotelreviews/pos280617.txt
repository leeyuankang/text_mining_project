being near the beach made for a lovely short walk the neighborhood was clean and quiet the dining area was lovely and service was good i m glad we weren t interested in the pool because a big noisy fun loving crowd dominated the space but it was a small pool the atmosphere was pleasant for a small room it was well designed the bed was comfortable we enjoyed our meals there the jazz music played in the lobby was an extra nice touch we had never been to barcelona before as african americans we ve had a variety of experiences abroad generally positive with a sprinkling of stupidity but that can taint a vacation and leave deep impressions we know to check in with people who look like us first but we heard nothing but good things icaria reinforced that view it was our very first stop and we felt very comfortable there we even felt a little sad that when we returned to barcelona a week later we were staying elsewhere
