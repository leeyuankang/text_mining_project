the staff was friendly and always helpful large safe in room big enough for our laptops the breakfast was amazing the all you can eat espresso and mimosas was worth the stay you can eat a large breakfast and then not eat tapas until the hotel is right next to the beach but heat and sand can be tough for a toddler so we visited the pool more than the beach the pool is all one deepness our toddler was the only one everyone else was adults so all the chairs were taken for sunbathers and no one was really in the pool we just waited until a chair became free the pool was quiet so we felt we had to keep our voices down the pool had a bar tender so the whole family enjoyed the pool the hotel is walking distance to the beach and beach restaurants it is also easy to get a taxi or jump on buses i wish there were more cafes around it but we walked down and found some it can be a little ghost town after but we stayed out until yes with our toddler but it was completely safe we found barcelona very child friendly with playgrounds almost in every block instead of requesting expensive taxis to and from the airport because of car seats take the aerobus it will drop you at the plaza de espanya enjoy some of the cafes in that neighborhood and then get the bus to the hotel cheap and the busses have ac car seat problem solved
