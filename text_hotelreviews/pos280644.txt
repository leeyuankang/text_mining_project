location was great in a quiet part of central barcelona with little tourists two blocks from the beach if you want a very central location downtown with tons of touristy bars then this is not the place if you want a relaxed atmosphere close to the beach it is great there are a few restaurants and a shopping mall catering more to locals nearby which is nice to get away from the crowds taxi from the airport eur taxi to the la rambla some very nice restaurants right along the beach park and zoo and aquarium nearby excellent breakfast
