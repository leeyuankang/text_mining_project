the sb icaria is a well positioned hotel with everything that the traveler needs it is a great base for the beach and visiting barcelona in general we stayed in a family room for the second time the only downside is there are no balconies to the rooms and there is no tv in the children s portion of the room the breakfast was excellent more than anyone could expect and definitely worth the money minutes to the beach and to the marina on foot to the zoo i would recommend using the overland city buses also you can catch a bus from gaudi park straight to the hotel for only a few euros i think it was the but you had better check
