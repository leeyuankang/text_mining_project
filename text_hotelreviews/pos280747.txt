we didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that however the rooms were lovely and cleaned every day with fresh towels the staff were very friendly arrival we arrived at at the hotel even though we knew couldn t check in until we was just going to drop our suitcases off and then come back later however we was told that a room was available so we was able to check in there and then before the check in time we was very impressed the pool is lovely and even though we went in october the outside jacuzzi was still heated lovely location about walk to the centre however there are taxis outside all the time and a bus stop too if you want to hop on the bus mins walk to the beach and the marina great location would definitely come back
