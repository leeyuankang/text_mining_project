buffet breakfast offered choice but the scrambled eggs need to be reviewed as these leave an unpleasant fishy after taste hotel was within walking distance from beach and offers pool facilities too with a hot tub sauna as well great amenities as a supermarket is a min walk walk to marina and port we bought freshly squeezed orange juice and used the minibar to keep cool booked city tour via hotel was charged twice but hotel did refund me for the overcharge
