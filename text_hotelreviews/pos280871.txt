very nice hotel located only mins walk away from icaria beach the bus stop is right outside the hotel which makes it very convenient to move around in barcelona the staff was friendly the room size was big and it was sparkling clean we stayed for nights and there was no trouble at all hotel arranged an airport shuttle for of us and charged only euros which was pretty awesome as the airport is quite far there are few happening night clubs about mins walk away and nightlife is awesome i will definitely stay here again
