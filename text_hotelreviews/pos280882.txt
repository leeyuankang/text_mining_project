the location was awesome and good breakfast but there was no air conditioning so sweating and no sleep through the night they said they only have cool air con from late may to save energy costs maybe they should charge less for the stay before may as we payed for an air con room which they don t have they told us too open the window which resulted in mosquito bites the beach is literally min walk away which was cool but this hotel is way over priced the staff were helpful and friendly and willing to help on our problems but ultimately i wouldn t stay here again well not for this price
