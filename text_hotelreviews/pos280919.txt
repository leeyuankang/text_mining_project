the hotel staff all of them from reception cleaners to the restaurant staff were really nice and helpful the rooms are a good size with a big bathroom and facilities provided were as expected value for money we were able to walk to most of our places such as the beach citadel park cathedral of barcelona etc would highly recommend this hotel
