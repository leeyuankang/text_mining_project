nice hotel and once we figured out the bus routes we could get into the central city but it s a long walk from the nearest metro neighborhood mostly run down and no good restaurants were found incredibly loud noise late into the night from the pool area the first night we were there but not the we stayed at different hotels on this trip and the staff here spoke the least english of any of them
