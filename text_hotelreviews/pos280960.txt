location was great close to the beach but also easy to get into the centre of barcelona bus stops just outside hotel then only a short ride into the city centre the hotel and room were clean and were lucky on the floor to be able to see the sagrada familia in the distance breakfast was great lots of choice and fresh bonus are the ice machines located in the stairwell on each floor
