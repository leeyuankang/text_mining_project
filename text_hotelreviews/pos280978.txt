this hotel is in a fantastic location in relation to the proximity to the beach and the city the beach is a five minute walk away and the city a short ride on the bus which stops outside the hotel there is also a supermarket a short walk away the rooms are clean reasonably spacious and have lovely bathrooms the only thing is the beds are quite soft for people who prefer a harder matress the breakfast every morning is varied and has a very wide selection even for a vegetarian which was a plus i would stay again in this hotel or reccomend it to friends family as it is good value for money and a perfect base for exploring barcelona
