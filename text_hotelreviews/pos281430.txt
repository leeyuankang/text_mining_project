clean modern facilities in a good location convenient to the metro tourist sights and fun food and nightlife our room featured a nice view over the city rooftop bar and pool also with views were a big bonus in the summer although the pool and deck chair area is pretty small and was therefore crowded during peak times the breakfast buffet was yummy and we were happy to catch a free beer tasting one afternoon the staff was very helpful and gave us good recommendations for tapas
