location to metro and restaurants are excellent rooftop pool and bar are very nice even at night i would call this a boutique hotel very modern and fun we had two rooms for five people the triple room was large air conditioning was excellent you can control your own and we like it extra cold really enjoyed barcelona in general buy your skip the line tickets before you arrive
