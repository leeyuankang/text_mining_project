great location next to the metro so good for hoping on and off and visiting places however still only a minute walk to las ramblas port and other sight seeing areas hotel is clean modern with good facilities and staff who want to help you always nice to see room is decent size and comfortable great feature is roof top pool bar and terrace perfect to relax for an hour after a full day before heading out also the bar la confiteria which is a second walk to the right of the hotel was a great find to end the night all in all highly recommend
