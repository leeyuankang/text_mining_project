the hotel stuff were very friendly and helpful the hotel room and other common areas were very clean and matching our expectation the main advantage was the location of the hotel and its proximity to the metro station which is a min walk distance we also liked the surrounding area as it is very vital lots of cafes and bakeries near by all in all it was a good choice
