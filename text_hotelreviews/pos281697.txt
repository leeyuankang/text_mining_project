xabi and juan were fantastic as was the evening attendant carlos xabi especially helped us each day with our plans and reservations and travel arrangements his service was invaluable to our brief stay on our last day we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the afternoon then return to pick them up and meet our shuttle to the airport our room was beautifully decorated perfect for single people and the snacks were particularly tempting we could not resist a number of them the red wine was fantastic and worth every penny we will definitely be back thank you
