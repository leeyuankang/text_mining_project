stunning building lots of space and great for eating drinking in for a change one of the best locations in our opinion in the city as easy access to the gothic quarter as well as the marina shopping and amazing bars etc staff were very helpful for example with booking tickets for the fc barcelona game a must for everyone even non football fans just for the atmosphere we visit barcelona at least once a year and this was one of the best places we have stayed for many reasons and would therefore highly recommend if you are looking for something slightly different to a normal hotel
