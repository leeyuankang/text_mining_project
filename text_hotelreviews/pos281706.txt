the atmosphere of the building the decor of the hotel and the room is great sets it apart from the modern soulless rooms and the carbon copy chain hotels the bed was hard and really comfortable very central can walk to many places from la rambla to the harbour and close to the metro stations nice alley ways to explore all around the hotel very helpful staff
