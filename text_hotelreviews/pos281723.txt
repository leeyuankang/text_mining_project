gorgeous little boutique hotel just a couple blocks from all the action in la rambla it has a high end feel and unique design lots of attention to detail and it showed our room had exposed stone walls very high ceilings and a big comfortable bed that helped to cure our jet leg after at hour journey great shower with fantastic water pressure a nice kitchenette with a well stocked bar and snacks and coffee machine we didn t use it because we were steps away from some of the best food the world has to offer but in a pinch it would be great friendly staff we arrived in the early morning and our room was not ready as we expected check in time was but they took our mobile number and called us at to let us know the room was ready early we only stayed for one night and would definitely stay again for what it s worth we are a gay couple in our s we were treated very well and without discrimination
