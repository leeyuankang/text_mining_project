the staff were amazing antony the barman was great fun and very friendly the front of house staff were also very helpful and friendly the room was great and the bed was super comfy i recommend getting breakfast while here it was perfect the metro and train station are just down the road and if you feel up for a walk the main attractions are only about a min walk but most of the time we used the train and it only took around mins thanks for a great stay
