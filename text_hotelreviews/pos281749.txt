everything even before we arrived the staff were fantastic quickly and efficiently returned a valuable item from our room that we had left behind loved it the hotel is gorgeous the people helpful informative happy and obliging the feel about the hotel mirrors exactly the location personally by far the best area of barcelona to stay in perfect location especially with a young child would suggest a shuttle car cab from the airport as it can be hard to find time tucked well away from la rambla quiet quaint and safe also within ten minutes of the public transport points in palca de catalunya mins to la rambla mins to the harbour we will be back although i may avoid the bullying of a yr old to try to roof top pool in february again thank you to all arai
