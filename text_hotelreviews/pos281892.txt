also very good prices at the hotel bar including free nibbles with drinks it was nice to find accommodation in a residential neighbourhood so that the restaurants and shops were frequented by the locals rather than tourists two nearby eateries had excellent food good prices and friendly staff la palmera for fish and inka burger for burgers
