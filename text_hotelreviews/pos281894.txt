the location was a little sketchy i would not go out at night of course i am travelling solo so couples might find it different the room did not have a refrigerator and ice not available unless you went down to the restaurant and tried to get the bartender to give you a tiny empty glass of it no english tv channels at all floors were dirty my worst complaint was the front desk giving absolutely incorrect directions when i asked the girl for directions to the pedrera she said minute walk ok it was at least miles the food at the restaurant is disgusting every site very far away no coffee machine microwave wierdest shower ever and if i had to do it again i would not stay here
