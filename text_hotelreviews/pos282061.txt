the staff here were amazing a particular mention to xavier but all reception staff were polite and always did everything to help regardless of the time of day location is great only a short walk one block to either the open top bus tours stop or metro station we used the metro to get to and from la ramblas and the beach and the tour bus to get to parc g ell nou camp etc the great thing about the bus is that the stops are always close to where you want to be and you can pick up little bits of knowledge you wouldn t ordinarily get whilst driving about can also pick up a nice tan upstairs along with a welcome breeze word of warning regarding the metro take a second to orientate yourself when you come out its easy to take the wrong direction when emerging into the daylight as they are usually on an intersection with directions to go in but the metro itself is easy to navigate so long as you know what stops you want prior to setting off there are no signs about saying for tourist attraction a alight at station c etc there are also some great little restaurants near the hotel recommend bar fantastic tapas and service and there are also plenty of little bakeries and caf s knocking around the nearby streets where we could pick up breakfast for for both of us rather than each in the hotel also as my girlfriend commented each time we stepped through the main entrance the lobby always smelled wonderful only a little thing but it certainly makes a difference the rooftop terrace is also nice with space enough to sunbathe and the jacuzzis better name than hot tub not necessarily hot giving welcome relief from the august heat and precious therapy for feet after a day pounding the streets
