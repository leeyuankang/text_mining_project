i can t say enough about the friendliness of the very professional staff i felt welcome immediately and it seemed they could not do enough for us everyone had a smile an enthusiastic hello and seemed genuinely interested in our comfort and enjoyment of the hotel and we were there for a single night imagine how we would have been appreciated if we weren t running out the next morning moving on to the hotel itself it is clean modern comfortable and every detail is well thought out the shower was spectacular think high end fixtures and water pressure beds and pillows were very comfortable too room size was european small but nothing was lacking very functional and well designed
