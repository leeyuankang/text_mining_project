the location is extremely convenient next door to a metrostation provenca the rooftop pool and bar provides good chill out and the room is comfy but what makes this hotel an extraordinary experience is the staff who are everyone of them consistently super friendly and make you feel more than welcome i can only recommend this hotel and while you are at it ask the barman bernatt for some tips
