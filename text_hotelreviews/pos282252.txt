the olivia balmes hotel is an amazing modern hotel in the perfect location of barcelona everything from shopping to dinning to site seeing are all within walking distance or a short hop on the metro while a little chilly for the roof top pool it was a nice place to relax and soak up the sun i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in barcelona
