the staff were amazing very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english the room was modern clean and well detailed with lots of space there was absolutely no noise from inside or outside the hotel and although you could feel the metro trains occasionally there was no noise and really not an issue see other reviews we had a suite which was perfect for families as my daughter had her own room with doors completely separating the lounge with comfy sofabed and bedroom fab bathroom the restaurant was ok for emergencies in the evening but hotel staff recommended a great tapas bar almost next door cerveseria catalana which was much better than the ones in the centre of barcelona and very reasonably priced breakfast was however outstanding amazing bread spanish ham fresh fruit salad cheese hot breakfast and the best croissants the pool on the roof was a great sun trap and we chilled for a while in t shirts even in february the hotel is situated a few blocks from one of the main smart shopping streets nearby residential boutiques and restaurants it is to walk to the centre but the metro is right on the doorstep and there s a taxi rank outside and taxis are cheep
