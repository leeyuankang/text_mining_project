i am not the person that likes to write a review but before booking i always do read this time i had to say something about my stay in olivia balmes hotel first of all thanks to all stuff in hotel very kind and always at your disposal for any request at any time location perfect for sightseeing in center of barcelona breakfast very good with variety of food rooms modern with new furniture and lot of space for all clothes no need to keep some in luggage great value for money you pay taxi station just across the hotel playa de catalyna and rambla street just couple min walk distance to summarize my impression it is perfect for tourists and businesses trips to barcelona
