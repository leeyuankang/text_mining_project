the hotel is in perfect location for the city the hotel is less than a two minute walk to the closest metro station provenca which is linked to another station in which is perfect for helping you get to anywhere else in the city or down to the beach or further out to park guell the main street for shopping and eating is a walk and its only one street over so you won t even need to take the map with you the staff are very helpful and are always very friendly regardless of issue or time of day one of the staff happily got us a couple of towels for the beach another booked when we arrived we got an early check in and our room was upgraded we also got complimentary drinks at the bar we stayed for four nights and everyday our sheets and towels were changed can not fault this hotel or the staff the facilities were great
