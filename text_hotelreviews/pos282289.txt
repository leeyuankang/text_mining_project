my husband and i stayed here on our very first visit to spain and we were so impressed with the level of service upon arrival the staff at the hotel offered us a beer and wine while they got our room paperwork ready it was such a nice touch especially after being on planes and airports for hours our room was also upgraded for being our first time in barcelona and we had a plate with goodies waiting for us in the room
