i liked everything about this hotel from the moment i walked in its a nice gesture from the hotel to welcome us with a plate of cake and fruit the staff are always smiling and willing to help the rooms are spacious and very clean the location is perfect shopping and cafes just minute walk and about walking to la rambla the car park is also easily accessible
