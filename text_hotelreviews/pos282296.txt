we stayed at olivia balmes for a part of our honeymoon our whole stay was incredible from a glass of cava to the upgraded room to the pool deck but the best part of our stay was josep he was so helpful in booking tickets for us giving us excellent restaurant recommendations cerveseria catalana and making sure we knew where we were going
