we stayed here for five nights while we were on holiday in barcelona located close to many of the major attractions shops and restaurants the hotel is very new and modern with great amenities and very helpful staff we were very warmly greeted by the hotel staff upon arrival who kindly gave us a free upgrade to the superior room the room must have been one of the largest and cleanest i ve ever been in with a large comfortable bed and a rain shower we were extremely impressed with the hotel and would definitely stay here again if we visit barcelona in the future
