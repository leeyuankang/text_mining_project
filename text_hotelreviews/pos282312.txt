i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough especially if you have young kids the staff were incredibly friendly we were always greeted with a smile and help at the front door given we ve children under anytime we requested anything the staff attended to it instantly and would always come to our room to attend to our requests the cot provided was clean and new hotel is well located to great tapas bar and las ramblas it is a bit of a walk approx to the beach however this ended up working great for our toddler as he slept during the siesta walk and less than euros if you catch a taxi the amenities are great very family friendly
