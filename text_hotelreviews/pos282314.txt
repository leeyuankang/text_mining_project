very smart location near shopping history any type of food but two steps apart of crazy tourist movement high level service and friendly personnel modern technology and fresh rooms breakfasts are good quality but not fantastic so if you need more there are huge amount of cafe and restaurants beside where you can eat everything you want plan to live in olivia hotel again thank you very much for real hospitality
