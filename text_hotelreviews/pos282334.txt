the rooms are spacious modern and comfortable the staff incredibly helpful and polite we had heavy rain during our stay they had ran out of hotel umbrellas so the kind lady behind the desk leant her personal umbrella for us the pool is really lovely although small and the rooftop terrace so relaxing
