if i could have given out of i would have having travelled to many and star hotels for business and leisure i can say what sets this hotel apart is their wonderful staff and incredible attention to detail they are so helpful and always greet you with a smile the roof terrace with pool is fantastic and turns a city break into a twin centre holiday allowing you to take in the sights of barcelona in the day returning to relax by the pool in the afternoon i will definitley be returning
