we visited this hotel after a week stint in portugal and spain we were weary and the olivia balmes was just what we needed e spent the mornings walking walking and walking and looking looking and looking and the afternoons lounging by the pool the environment was great overlooking barcelona from the roof top and they do a pretty good gin and tonic
