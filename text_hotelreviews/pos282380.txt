the staff at the front desk and front door were very helpful professional and also quite funny in a very cheerful way when we asked for more milk for the tea in our room i received a jug of cold milk from the kitchen which lasted us for several days in the room fridge evening meal was excellent although too cold to swim in march the roof top pool and surroundings will be great for relaxing in warmer months
