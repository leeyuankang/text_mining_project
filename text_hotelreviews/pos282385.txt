the staff front desk housekeeping restaurant was very nice they were always very helpful and always ready to help with a smile the location is amazing because it s very near metro stations that are main transfer points so easy to get to all over the city center it s very close about min walk to diagonal and passeig de gracia where many things are dining shopping and also museums like cassa mila and cassa batllo etc and yet it s removed enough from the main areas that it s nice to get back to the hotel in a relatively quieter area
