very nice attention given by the receptionist i was offered a very warm welcome together with a welcome drink at my choice before checking in to the room the standard room has a great setup for its size my room despite was right in front of the lift but that never bothered me neither the street noise has ever came to my attention the whole level of comfort was great in general i tried the breakfast once it could still be better but for a four star hotel and the booking com deal i got it was just fine i couldn t use the rooftop pool this time and i will make sure to come back once again when the weather is warmer the hotel area is full of nice restaurants and access to the city
