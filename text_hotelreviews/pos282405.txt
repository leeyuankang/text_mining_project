i have stayed here several times it is both a nice facility and a great value the rooms are modern and functional which is the style that i prefer i love the showers which have the option of hand held or rain the breakfast buffets have a wide variety and they will prepare eggs on a custom basis the restaurant menu at other meals is somewhat limited but very good the location is perhaps a minute walk from las ramblas and this is also my preference
