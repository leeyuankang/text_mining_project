when we arrived the staff were so welcoming we got a complimentary drink and they took our suitcases to our room they were so helpful when we asked about barcelona and getting around the room was my favourite part it was so lovely complimentary bottle of champagne in the room i love the idea of the open bathroom the location was minutes to the main las ramblas
