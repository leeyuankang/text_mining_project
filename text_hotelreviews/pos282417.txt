staff were wonderful and were able to offer us directions maps and book tickets for us to make planning trips easier recommending bars restaurants and even printing boarding passes we were made to feel very welcome right from the start with arrival drinks at the bar room was very clean and modern and the rooftop pool was perfect for relaxing in the sun after a day of exploring excellent location out of the more touristy areas but also within easy walking distance of them and only a few blocks from the nearest metro station easy to get to all the big attractions whether by walking or by using the metro we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel there are plenty of cafes nearby which offer a nice alternative
