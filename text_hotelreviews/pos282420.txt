frankly the best hotel my wife and i have stayed in the location gives easy access to excellent restaurants shopping and the city of barcelona the layout was fantastic you felt there was room to move around the hardwood floors were spotless and the plumbing effective and efficient loved two sinks and the staff was very helpful and plesant and i personally loved to relax at the pool we also enjoyed breakfasts in the restaurant i repeat the best i have seen
