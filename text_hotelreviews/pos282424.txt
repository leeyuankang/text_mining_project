excellent location within easy walking distance of all the major sights lovely modern hotel very friendly staff we got a glass of cava on arrival a map without even asking and some tips on sights and restaurants as soon as we arrived they accommodated a late checkout without any fuss the pool and lounging area on the roof is an added bonus for chilling after a long day of walking
