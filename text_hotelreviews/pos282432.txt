great location of the hotel easy accessible by car and underground parking arranged by hotel the food and roof top pool are a great value in the hot august summer we traveled through barcelona by our own car and this was very easy to do the location is great because it is out of the over crowded touristic area and located in a more quiet clean and beautiful neighbourhood staff was super helpful and the comfort of the room was great
