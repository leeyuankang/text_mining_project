our experience completely exceeded expectations last time we were in barcelona we stayed at hotel arts but frankly enjoyed our experience at olivia balmes more we went to the arts for lunch a couple of times during this trip and this reinforced our opinion that it could be much more pleasant to stay in a good centrally located star hotel with warm staff than a big impersonal luxury resort we travelled as a group of and reserved different types of rooms double triple and suite and were very pleased with all of them they were all spacious and bright and clean everyone at the hotel bent over backwards to be friendly and helpful as we arrived well before check in time we waited in the restaurant and had beer and coffee upon requesting a bill we were told that those were our complimentary welcome drinks later one member of the group had a minor health issue and needed to see a doctor the lady at the front desk couldn t have been more helpful she walked the guest to a nearby clinic and translated his ailment to the doctor who promptly and effectively dealt with the issue although the hotel is centrally located it still exuded a sense of calm the entrance is very well appointed indeed there is space for cars to load and drop off and there is a taxi bay right across the street this will be our go to hotel in barcelona we enjoyed hospitality at its best and at very reasonable prices with no nickeling and diming
