great location many places are easily accessible either by taxi or metro lots of different places to eat around the area room was spacious and bed was comfortable hotel is just outside city centre so no outside noise at night great for a good nights sleep hotel staff very polite and helpful overall great hotel if you don t want to be in the centre but not too far from everything
