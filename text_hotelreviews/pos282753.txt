i like the spaciousness of the room and the shower and toilet i like the pastries in the breakfast restaurant they are the best i was tempted to ask the staff if they were being baked by their pastry chef since i wanted to praise him her for the very delicious pastries but then while walking going back to the hotel we came across this pastry shop where we saw all the pastries that we have been eating during breakfast in the hotel though the hotel are just ordering those pastries it was still a very memorable experience to be able to eat for a few mornings such yummy pastries which never happened in star hotels around the world based on my experience
