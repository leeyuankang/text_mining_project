staff were friendly welcoming and helpfull the breakfast as stated was a good breakfast with plenty of choice we could hear the metro but not enough to cause discomfort or to interfere with sleep the window looked out onto a well shaft so no view apart from that very comfortable good shower bathroom within a short walk of barcalona central a metro stop very close all in all very pleased
