overall hotel was excellent clean tidy and friendly staff perfect for a weekend break with the family our son was brave enough to try the ice cold pool not quite pool weather sure in the summer water would be warmer hotel is walking distance to cafes bars and into the main shopping district also good location for sagarda famillia loved barcelona will definitely be visiting again
