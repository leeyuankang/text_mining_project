i liked that the hotel was centrally located you could easily walk to the top sightseeing locations or easy access to buses or use a nearby metro stop we came from france on the tgv train to sants station from sants station we were able to catch a direct line to block away from the hotel i would return to this hotel if i came back to barcelona
