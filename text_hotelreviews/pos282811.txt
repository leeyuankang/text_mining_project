location is a minute walk from passieg de gracia closest metro stop provenca staff friendly and helpful felt secure in the room terrace a nice touch for smokers bought the hop on hop off tour package through front desk which was a great way to get introduced to this city eix central cafe is close by and they make a mean cappucino for non tourist prices staff let us check out at with no extra cost and we also utilized the luggage storage which was very convenient a few english channels on the tv and you can hook up your laptop to the tv if you want to watch movies from your laptop on the big screen i would stay here again if they got beds that provided more back support
