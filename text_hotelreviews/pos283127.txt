i liked the room very much i was actually surprised d unfortunately me my girlfriend were in vienna sporthotel for a single night so i didn t really get to take any pictures as we were in a rush the bed was great and you have small dressers closets for your stuff which is an important thing for me even though i didn t get to utilize that breakfast is great as well everything is clean and nicely presented
