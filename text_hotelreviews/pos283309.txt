megaro hotel is well located directly across the street from st pancras and king s cross stations the property has the hotel proper and a really nice apartment building around the block on the corner of st chad and argyle square we decided to come to london a day early and megaro hotel s excellent customer focused staff helped us find an adequate room as our initially booked family room wasn t available that night they put us up in the one bedroom apartment basement level in the separate building which was fabulous seriously i d live there full kitchen with spacious living room that had a pullout double and the excellent capable staff brought a rollaway single in for my son the bedroom is large with a very comfortable queen bed two tvs in the apartment air conditioning wi fi router in each apartment the bathroom was modern and huge the only drawback was that it was a tub with a hand held shower head you couldn t stand and shower the location doesn t have a lot of sights or places to go but the kings cross st pancras tube station has tube lines stopping there you re stops from anywhere in greater london and there s a great pizza union a minute walk from the apartment which has freshly made brick oven pizza for takeaway we liked the one bedroom so much that the staff managed to get us to be able to stay there in the same room for essentially the same price for the duration of our stay as we were taking the eurostar at a very early time upon our departure from london you couldn t pick a better spot there s not much that i can say bad about this place and so much to say good great facilities location staff
