we booked an apartment to stay in over our wedding week end it was a home away from home with everything you may possibly need at hand we were greeted with a bottle of champagne to congratulate us which was the icing on the cake the staff were so friendly and helpful nothing was a problem i would definitely recommend this hotel apartment
