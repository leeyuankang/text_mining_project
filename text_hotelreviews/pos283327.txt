the hotel was amazing we had a lovely stay we had a deluxe double room over looking the stations the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom door was glass so if you don t know your travel companion that might be an issue but for us it just added to the style of the room staff while we were there were helpful and always had a smile to greet you
