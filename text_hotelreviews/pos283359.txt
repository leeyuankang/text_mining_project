the staff were very welcoming and the room was large modern clean and comfortable a very good size for central london there are a few high tech bits a coffee machine once i found it and sorted out how to put water in lots of lights although brighter lighting in the bathroom would help with the makeup and air con which i struggled to find out how to turn off the answer is ask the staff who were enthusiastic and helpful throughout it is very convenient for st pancras and kings cross stations as it s just across the road buses and tubes are close by as are a selection of restaurants i hope to stay there again
