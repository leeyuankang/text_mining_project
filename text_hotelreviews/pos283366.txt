the location is great just across from st pancras reception staff were really helpful and friendly the restaurant staff didn t sometimes seem that engaged we stayed in an apartment rather than the main hotel having a separate lounge and a kitchen was great and it was well enough equipped to prepare simple meals i think if you stayed in the main hotel the experience would be different
