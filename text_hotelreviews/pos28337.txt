we were upgraded to the room on the top floor with an amazing view of the eiffel tower it was very romantic and very quiet which was lovely there was a market outside on wednesday morning where we got some baguettes and breakfast it was very cultural and interesting walking to the eiffel tower in the evening was only a minute walk and it was very magical and easy to get back to the hotel the staff were very helpful and spoke very good english as well as this metro access was great we could get around the city no problem i would definitely recommend getting a room on the top floor
