second time we have stayed there this year location right opposite kings cross tube station is perfect for getting in and out of west end which is also walkable friendliest and most helpful staff we have ever encountered anywhere in a city hotel spotlessly clean room really well equipped we stayed in room which was a standard double but it was huge compared to equivalent standard rooms at other hotels the room looked out at st pancras station the windows are double glazed so there is no traffic noise whatsoever
