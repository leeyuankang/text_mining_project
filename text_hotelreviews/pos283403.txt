no complaints with this place i travel all over the world and this hotel is a little gem staff was amazing very kind and accommodating restaurant was also very good rooms were big and the bathrooms are a nice size good bang for the buck and a very convenient location the kings cross and st pancras stations are right across the street along with the eurostar train taxi s are everywhere so it s easy to move around from there don t think any of the guests were disappointed
