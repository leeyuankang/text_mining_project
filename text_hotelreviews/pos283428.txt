the staff were very friendly and efficient the hotel is visually interesting both inside and out and the bar dining area was atmospheric and well priced for great food far from the usual bland town hotels very good position opposite the eurostar station handy for trains tube and with a direct train like to gatwick i would definitely stay there again
