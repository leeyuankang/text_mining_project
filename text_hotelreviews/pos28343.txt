the location was excellent it it within walking distance of the eiffel tower and just a short walk to the metro we were able to go everywhere we wanted to go in hardly any time at all there are plenty of shops within very close walking distance and delicious restaurants we really enjoyed our stay in paris because it was so easy to get around
