in general the hotel was ok the location is of course very good if you want to reach the city center on foot the view from the rooms is directly at the road and metro trains which is not so attractive the only rooms with a nice view are on the top of the building but they cost even more the hotel is clean and modern but the rooms are so small that we could hardly close the door of a bathroom being inside in general i felt that i paid too much for what was offered
