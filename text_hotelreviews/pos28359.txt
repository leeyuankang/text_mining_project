just a ten minute walk from the eiffel tower and with views of the tower itself from the room this hotel was an excellent choice loved the decor very nice staff comfortable quiet despite the metro running outside great location for walking to cafes and restaurants near many sights and with two metro lines running outside hope to come back to paris again soon and le parisis will be my first choice
