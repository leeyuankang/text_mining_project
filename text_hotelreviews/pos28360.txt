location was very good and there was even a twice a week market outside the door as i was on the floor the noise of the market didn t impact and i could view the eiffel tower which i had paid to see the friends i was meeting stayed in a more expense hotel but it was too busy and nothing in the room was working and they had no view even though they were very close to the eiffel tower a good smaller deserved rating
