we had a fantastic weekend at the hotel parisis the staff were supurb right from arrival and provided everything we could have required the room was modern clean tidy and had an excellent view of the eiffel tower the hotel is also fantastically located within walking distance of the eiffel tower and also the metro which made exploring paris very easy we would highly recommend
