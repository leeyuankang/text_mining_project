the staff in the hotel went out of their way to help us our room was ready early so we could go in and freshen up before exploring they even let us borrow an adapter plug when we realised we bought the wrong one the hotel was in a great location too only a minute slow walk from the eiffel tower the bars and restaurants around the hotel were great too the room was clean and comfortable with a great shower and an amazing big window with a view of the eiffel tower worth every penny and would love to return
