i have to say that i am impressed with this hotel having heard rumors about how the hotel staff in paris can be rude i came there with low expectations but the staff was really nice just the right amount of professionalism and friendliness our room was clean and it looked fresh and new we also had a room upgrade where we could see a little bit of the eiffel tower the breakfast was good too for just it was a treat i love that every room has their own samsung phone with that you can take anywhere with you it was really helpful the eiffel tower is about kms from the hotel so you can walk or take a taxi for
