le parisis hotel is a beautiful hotel located in quite a central location very close to the metro station only minutes from the eiffel tower and heaps of restaurants surrounding it it s not too far from the arc de triomphe or the champs elysees about a minute walk but it takes you through some beautiful views of paris if safety is a concern we felt very safe in the area we walked to the eiffel tower around midnight and came back around but the area was still very lively with lots of people walking around the staff are extremely friendly accomodating we were always greeted with a smile and always asked about our day and what we planned to do for the day we were allowed to check in at because our room was ready at no extra cost which was a very nice touch considering we d been in paris since all in all it was an amazing stay and i would definitely recommend it stay there again
