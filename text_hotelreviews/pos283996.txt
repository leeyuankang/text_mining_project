food hallen is in the same building serving some fantastic street food and the breakfast club is just over the road so there should be enough food choice to satisfy anyone far enough from the centre to be very quiet but only a minute walk back into the middle of all the shops and bars amsterdam has to offer our room had huge windows on three sides and staff were friendly and helpful it is also a short walk to the vondelpark which is lovely for a stroll and a drink in the cafe
