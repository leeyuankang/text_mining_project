decor definitely different trendy hip etc conversion done very well in contemporary style in contrast to lobby room like photo open feel of single lobby with vintage decorations arrived early and unable to check in they stored my bags and put them in my room staff helpful and kind got a free coffee drinking water cooler at reception a thoughtful touch hotel is only a storey high but there is a lift for those with sore feet or heavy lugagge room done to a high standard door has an alarm if not locked behind you which is a huge bonus for safety tv with some english channels nespresso machine in room is handy at least variety of pods provided probably not enough for two people but you can request more also nice teas green and english breakfast provided loved the bathroom with both bath tub and shower nice toiletries breakfast was tempting as both buffet and a la carte available not taken up as wanted to have a lie in and not rush limit there is a cafe and restaurant at hotel in a more residential area hence more quiet but further from centre trams nearby you can also walk to central areas within mins depending on your route and speed
