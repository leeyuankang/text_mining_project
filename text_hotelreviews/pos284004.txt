wow what to say i loved everything this place was much much more cool than i expected it s decoration was quirky unique chic and trendy you can t stop exploring even though it s not even that big of a building the staff was fantastic they upgraded me because the room wasn t ready so i was very grateful the hotel itself is quiet and comfortable more than you d think the room was sooo comfy and very clean and the location take me back to food de hallen which is connected to the hotel the neighborhood is the best and super trendy safe i paid twice the amount for a luxury hotel in dam square the night before and this was much more enjoyable comfy and for half the price per night i enjoyed being away from so many tourists all the while being treated greatly as one if anyone noticed haha please do yourself the favor of experiencing this place and the location if you visit beautiful amsterdam
