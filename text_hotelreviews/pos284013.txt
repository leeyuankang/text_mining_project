most of the staff went out of the way to be helpful the building is also attached to the foodhallen which is a wonderful foodcourt with dishes from all over the world there is also a daily market at ten katestraat which is also the name of the nearest tram stop from ten katestraat tram runs to central station from which everywhere else in the city can be accessed and tram runs to leidseplein square which is full of bars and restaurants then from leidseplein and you can also get tram to rembrandtplein which is lovely far enough out from the mayhem and has a more relaxed vibe the tram system seems to be the best way to move around the city fast safe
