pretty much everything the hotel is fun and individual certainly different from standard chain hotels it s new clean well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful the location is also great not being in the hectic old town but still within walking distance of most of the city s best attractions and next door to an amazing food hall very much recommend a stay here
