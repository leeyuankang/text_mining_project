the hotel is built inside an old tram depot and is a very good use of an old building we walked from the hotel to van gogh museum rijksmuseum etc one way and to anne frank house and the royal palace the other way we are in our sixties so younger people could walk everywhere if they wanted to very quiet loved the coffee machine in the room the food hall behind the hotel was very popular with younger people all staff were very helpful and went out of their way to offer assistance when needed free wifi which worked well
