the hotel was super cool while it was hard to find the front door due to construction the inside of the hotel is awesome they upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of wine with a note to congratulate us on our anniversary touches like that are so valuable we really enjoyed the food court we were there on a weekend not sure if it s the same during the week and ate there twice there was a market right outside with fresh food baked goods and more during one day of our stay great coffee amenities in the room right next to the tram so the location is perfect we walked everywhere though it was a short min walk to anne frank house we would absolutely stay here again
