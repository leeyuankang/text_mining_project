i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough the staff could not be more helpful and our room provided stunning views of the eiffel tower the location was great and directly opposite the metro which was ideal for accessing all major tourist attractions our room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean the perfect choice to celebrate my birthday a big thank you to the staff for helping to make it so special
