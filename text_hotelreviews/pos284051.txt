beautiful renovated building with trendy and quirky interior in a quiet location yet within easy access of main attractions the uk plug socket came in handy as i had forgotten my adapter the staff were friendly professional and very efficient our suite was very quiet and the beds singles pushed together very comfortable the hotel is next door to a fantastic food hall which serves almost every type of food you can imagine on the thursday evening it was transformed into a large sophisticated drinking venue and had an amazing vibe
