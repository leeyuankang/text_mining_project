absolutely loved staying here the staff were so welcoming warm and friendly they couldn t do more for us we arrived early so they stored our luggage whilst we went to do some sight seeing later when we went to dinner they took the time to ask how we found our room and if we needed anything the room couldn t have been better the view of the eiffel tower was amazing and getting to lie in bed and watch the lights twinkle away honestly made our stay so special and romantic the location of the hotel couldn t have been better metro stops only a few minutes walk away and the eiffel tower only took us mins i couldn t recommend this hotel enough so much so that they day after we got home i booked up again for my birthday in september can t wait
