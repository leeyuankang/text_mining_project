what a little gem its location is excellent in a trendy neighbourhood with good transport links to the main tourist areas the hotel is literally right next to a very hipster food hall small independent boutiques and possibly one of the coolest cinemas ever the decor is stylish and quirky and the rooms are clean and comfortable definitely our top choice for an amsterdam break
