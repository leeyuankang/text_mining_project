all the staff were super friendly super polite and super helpful the room was stunning not just functional but beautifully laid out and spacious and made the most of the building s previous incarnation as a tram depot despite being in a room directly above the bar because of the excellent sound proofing we didn t hear anything and consequently slept very well all the nights we were there the air conditioning was perfect too keeping us nice and cool despite the humid weather outside the d cor of the room was bright and airy too the shower was fabulous and spacious the breakfast was outstanding and i think they served the best coffee i have drunk in my life the bar was also lovely and the area on the ground floor where the bar lounge and restaurant were located were all really funkily uniquely decorated
