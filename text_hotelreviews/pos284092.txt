the hotel was very clean and tidy all of the staff friendly and helpful i was staying for my birthday and they provided a complimentary bottle of wine which was unexpected and very thoughtful the hotel is in a great location easily walkable to major attractions and very close to tram routes if you don t fancy a walk great value for money given the quality of the hotel and its location the hotel restaurant breakfast was very good lots of choice on the buffet and the bat offered a good selection of drinks i would definitely recommend staying to anyone
