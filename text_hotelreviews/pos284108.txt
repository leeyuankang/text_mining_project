the inside was amazing lots of living rooms where you could hang out and relax if you are not out visiting museums or doing tours the rooms are also very comfortable the scene is very hip the bar area was nice for relaxing and we enjoyed the restaurant as well since it was very cold while we were there it was nice to have a friendly comfortable hotel to relax in it is very light and airy a renovated commercial building there is a parking lot below the hotel if you need parking it is close enough to walk everywhere but also close to tram lines if you get tired and need a lift this area of the city is very nice to stay next door is an amazing food court we were able to buy a tram pass there as well as tickets to the keukenhof tulip garden highly recommend
