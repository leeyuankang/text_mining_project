de hallen was comfortable and really clean which as south africans we appreciated it doesn t feel like students have stayed there before you the bed was comfy and the hotel was quirky and welcoming located right next door to the food hallen we were able to taste various dishes throughout our stay apart from the great cheese holland doesn t really scream food capital so this food hall saved us as we ate our way through burgers ballen waffles cheese toasties etc they don t mind if you bring food back into the hotel room so it was great to make our way home at the end of a busy touristy day and enjoy dinner the wifi in de hallen hotel was strong which was helpful the staff were very friendly and we enjoyed the art sprinkled throughout the hotel about minutes from the grand central station via tram it s super easy to get to but a bit too far to walk everywhere definitely use a tram
