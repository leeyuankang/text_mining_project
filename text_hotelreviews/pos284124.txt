exceptionally welcoming staff in a very cleverly designed hotel great few nights sleep in the comfortable bed located just across the road from a trendy breakfast cafe in case you fancy a change from the hotel breakfast we liked staying a bit out of the centre of town as it was much quieter and meant we got a better sense of the city
