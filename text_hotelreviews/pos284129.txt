the hotel is great and the food hall next door is a must for a brilliant night out with food from all over the world plus a gin and tonic bar which is amazing love the fact that it isn t right on the tourist trail and you feel that you get to see the real amsterdam only a minute walk along and across the beautiful canal and you are at the sights
