the staff were fantastic very warm welcoming friendly and we loved the look design of the hotel too everything we wanted to see was within minutes walking distance and there were tram stops close by to get us to and from the station the room and hotel itself were very quiet and there were plenty of great places to dine out in the area would definitely stay here again
