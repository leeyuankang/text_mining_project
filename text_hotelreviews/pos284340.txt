probably the most comfortable bed i ve slept in in spain we had a junior suite with a balcony which was excellent tea and coffee in the room and a very reasonably priced minibar very pleasant and shady bar and terrace we were going to a concert in the jardin de palau and it was only a minute walk this hotel is not in the centre but is on the tourist bus route and near to metro stations
