extremely service minded staff they helped us with the little things like picking up a water bottle from the closed kitchen and other things the hotel is not particularly close to barcelona city centre but close enough to take a cab for euro also within in a min walk you have the tram or metro that will take you to the centre in min for us it was perfect because we needed to be in that area and its also very close to the airport but still in the city calm and nice area close to l illa shopping centre
