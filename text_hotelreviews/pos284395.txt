the best location for a break right in the city centre los ramblas is seconds away from the hotel i didnt eat in the hotel as breakfast was euro rooms were what you would expect to be in the middle of the city but big enough beds were comfortable staff were always helpful and friendly the pool area is tiny but really nice to cool down in after a day in the sunshine i would definately stay there again
