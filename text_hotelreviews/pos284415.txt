the hotel was in a perfect location for exploring all parts of the city with a taxi rank immediately outside tour buses directly across the road and la rambla away the staff were fab particularly the cocktail waiter by the pool serving the best mojito in a long time breakfast was amazing and the restaurant was really good too a shame more people don t eat there a must for anyone exploring barcelona
