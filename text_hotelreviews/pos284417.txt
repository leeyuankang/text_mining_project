we booked this room as an emergency we were returning from a cruise and i made a mistake about the day we were to arrive from the minute we stepped in the hotel the staff was smiles and welcoming we were upgraded to balcony suite and given complimentary water and chocolates we took a long bath in there very spacious tub now were american so we take a bit more room than the average european the entire place smelled amazing the a c was crispy cold a welcomed accommodation especially in the summer time check out was a breeze and the staff at this time was also super amazing i felt safe i felt at home and i wanted to stay for the remainder of my trip i would have done so if it was possible to cancel my other reservations i hope the staff knows how amazing they are they truly were a highlight on this trip thank you
