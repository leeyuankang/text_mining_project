very pleased with our stay at this hotel arrived rather late in the night quick check in and were surprised by a complimentary bottle of cava and a plate of fruits in the room situated in a more quiet street but very central just round the corner from plaza catalunya where the easy and reasonably priced aerobus arrives leaves we went by foot around the city but there is easy access to the underground and buses near the hotel the hotel is partly redecorated with a nice clean and cozy terrace with pool and bar the entrance and the main stairs are from the olden days and magnificent our room was with a spacious nicely decorated room hallway with large wardrobes that also fitted the suitcase large bathroom bathtub with shower and a very nice balcony with a set of chairs and table the balcony faced the street wich was a nice view and the balconydoors and windows were very efficiently soundproofed a kettle and tea coffe that was refilled every day the beds were comfortable and i am a bit fuzzy and the cleaning very good we didn t try the breakfast it seemed a bit expensive and we preferred to choose time and place to have breakfast outside the hotel we didn t try the restaurant either but the menu looked good there is also a nice reception area with cozy seatings and a bar we went to the spa one evening quite small but with a steamsauna and a pool with different massage waterbeams also very nice and clean everyone in the staff spoke excellent english and were very service minded
