hotel staff were without exception friendly and helpful we enjoyed the pool and bar perfect way to unwind after a day exploring the city the location was spot on and you wouldn t know from the pool or bedroom that you were so close to the heart of the action just a good hotel nothing glitzy but everything spot on we ve stayed at lots of city hotels this is right up there for a combination of location quality and value for money when we come back to the city we will book here again without question
