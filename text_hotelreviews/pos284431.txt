welcoming friendly and helpful staff our room and pool staff were as accommodating as possible to our requests i d definitely recommend and booked the hotel as recommended by my son and his wife who visited last year i have mobility problems but managed easily due to the location of the hotel to the placa catalunya and the hop on hop off bus service
