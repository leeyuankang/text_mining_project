we really didn t have the opportunity to enjoy our stay as it was so brief due to the problem with ba cancelling flights we had to find alternative flights and overnight accommodation we were impressed with the hotel even though we were in it for less than hours the staff were very friendly and welcoming and helped re printing off our boarding passes we would stay there again
