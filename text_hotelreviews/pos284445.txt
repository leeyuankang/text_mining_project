very good quality breakfast breakfast staff were on top of everything keeping all items filled and attractive i included it in my room rate but i think it would have been quite expensive to purchase separately all hotel staff were wonderful friendly and extremely helpful very near to public transportation buses and taxi stand easy to walk in any direction for attractions very central
