amazing location right in the heart of town so you can walk everywhere great helpful staff clean room bathroom was adequately large by european standards and all marble which made it nicer than the bedroom itself the bed was on the harder side but quite comfortable cable tv is provided the hotel has a nice outdoor pool deck which we didn t have time to use it would be great in the summer i would consider staying there again as overall the experience was good
