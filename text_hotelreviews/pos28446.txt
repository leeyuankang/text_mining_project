we had a partial view of the eiffel tower and a beautiful room there was a bit of a problem with the plumbing initially but the staff was great about dealing with it the hotel staff esp hamid yves and dimitri were wonderfully kind and helpful and made us feel at home and the breakfast and where it was served was absolutely the best we had a great stay and will certainly return one day
