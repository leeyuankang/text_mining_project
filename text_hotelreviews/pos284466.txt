this hotel is in a great location for visiting the city and for transport links to and from the airport very friendly and helpful staff comfortable rooms and extremely clean we were lucky enough to have a room with a terrace which was much appreciated in the warm spring sunshine excellent breakfast buffet with a wide variety of choices and for the evening there is a lovely restaurant on site we would use this hotel again on a return trip
