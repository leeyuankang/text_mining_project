fantastic breakfast selection i would recommend including breakfast as a package deal otherwise it is quite expensive although worth it we stayed in a standard room the bed was the biggest bed i have ever seen and the matteress and pillows were both very comfortable a bit on the hard side bathroom was quite luxurious the tv selection wasn t as good as we have seen in other hotels for english speaking but then again you re in barcelona and probably won t want to be in your room much anyway staff were friendly enough and willing to help great location would definitely stay in this hotel again
