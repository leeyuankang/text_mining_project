i couldn t be happier with the hotel we stayed there for my girlfriends birthday so i asked if there was anything they could do for her they upgraded us to a superior room free of charge and then in the evening before we went out they brought a bottle of prosecco up along with some fruit such a lovely gesture the hotel staff were brilliant and so helpful the room was a good size the bathroom was spacious and the shower was decent the bed was huge and extremely comfortable the location was great right at the top of la rambla and really central for all the other places we wanted to go and see there is the catalunya metro station right next to the hotel which has good links to most places you could want to go this was my first stay in barcelona all my future stays will undoubtedly be at this hotel we loved it that much and i can t praise it highly enough
