great front door i m not joking the carving on the door is wonderful perfect location ideal for the metro straight onto la rambla but just off the main square and so little street noise huge bathroom although the decor would not be our choice and a good range of complementary items useful when flying with only hand luggage comfy huge bed no noise from outside see what we didn t like excellent range at breakfast but like nearly all hotels it is buffet style the hotel restaurant was great innovative menu well prepared and excellent value we never eat in hotel restaurants we ate in this one twice when the hotel got it wrong which they did we were offered complementary cava and chocolates most of the staff were friendly and helpful
