starting from the unbeaten amazing location to the entrance of the hotel the atmosphere and nice smell at the lobby makes you happier right away staff are so nice and helpful rooms are very nice and clean cleaning service is very good and several times a day generous with the bathroom amenities automatic upgrade of the room was a very nice gesture welcome drinks at the bar although it is a little bit expensive but we didn t regret it at all worth every penny can t speak enough about the location it is the best for any type of activity we intended to do even better location than the other stars very luxurious hotels
