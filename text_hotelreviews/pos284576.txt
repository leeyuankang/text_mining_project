we enjoyed this hotel very much the location is wonderful very central minute walk from the central square plaza de catalunya from where you can make city tours by bus the service in the hotel was very good the staff is very helpful and friendly rooms are comfortable and clean we had one at the back of the hotel i can not judge how it is on the street side it might be noisy at times we only ate one time breakfast not included in the price in the hotel during our nights stay no complaints at all it was very good but there are many places around the square and on las ramblas where you can eat a good and cheaper breakfast overall we left the hotel with very positive feelings and definitely will come back to this hotel when we return to barcelona one of the most beautiful cities i have ever visited
