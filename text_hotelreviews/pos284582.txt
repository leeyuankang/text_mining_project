very nice hotel in a fantastic location easy access to the direct airport bus and just meters away from plaza catalunya las ramblas casa mila and casa batllo we had various problems opening the door to our room but once i spoke to the manager about the door he took care of it immediately he really went out of his way to make the rest of the stay a wonderful experience overall the whole staff was friendly the prices of beverages at the pool and the pizza were very reasonable and the breakfast buffet was great but very expensive
