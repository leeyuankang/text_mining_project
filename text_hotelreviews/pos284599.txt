what a gem literally on our second trip back to bcn in under a month we stumbled on a great deal on this hotel the location is amazing and literally a stroll onto the beautiful heart that is catalonia square room was a like an awesome bedroom apartment with a massive bathroom while we didnt get to use the facilities since the city was so alive they seemed to be great
