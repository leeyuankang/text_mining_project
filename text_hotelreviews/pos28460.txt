great hotel at a great location this hotel is really worth its money you are a minute walk away of two metro stations and a short walk of the champ de mars park the stuff is also really kind and helpful the only thing which isn t that convenient is that there is no restaurant in the hotel itself but there are plenty of restaurants next door there s also a small carrefour on the other side of the street which has all you need
