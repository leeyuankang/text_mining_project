our stay at hotel catalonia was simply amazing from exceptional staff and cleanliness of our room to chocolate delivery in the afternoon after siesta time we highly recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to be in the middle of the wonderful barcelona since its position is within walking distance to everything you are there to experience from heart of las ramblas to gaudi architecture to basilica of santa maria del mar and all its charming cafes and shops
