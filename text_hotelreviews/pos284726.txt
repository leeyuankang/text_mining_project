the location is great just several steps to pla a catalunya where you can take bus touristique around the city or immerse yourself in great shops for shopping walk for minutes and you get to las ramblas with its vibrant atmosphere and of course wake up in the morning and walk to mercado de la boqueria to enjoy wonderful breakfast or brunch it s a real feast for five senses the staff are really helpful they happily answer my questions the check in was a breeze i just showed my booking through the booking com app and we were given exactly the room that we booked with a private terrace the room is large with a large shower and amenities the contempo restaurant in the lobby serve delicious mediterranean food and you are entitled discount if you are a hotel guest dining in the restaurant the hotel also provides computers and printer in the lobby that would really be useful for printing tickets and boarding pass i will certainly stay in this hotel when i re visit barcelona
