i was in barcelona for a business trip and i stayed at this wonderful hotel the rooms are modern comfortable with a big balcony there is a swimming pool and a terasse in the back yard the staff is very friendly the location is ideal for the people visiting and site seeing as you are walking distance from gaudi s best sites also the shopping area and restaurants are very close by overall i always had good experience with catalonia hotels
