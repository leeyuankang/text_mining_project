the location of the hotel is one minute from the main central square in barcelona placa catalunya where there are cafes restaurants shops the hoho buses etc and yet the hotel rooms were very quiet the staff are fluent in english welcoming friendly and informative particularly claudia who went out of her way to assist and deal with all questions the buffet breakfast was superb the rooms and public spaces were all spotlessly clean and the ac worked which is important as august is very hot in barcelona
