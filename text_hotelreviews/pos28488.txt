visited here as an early valantines present for my girlfriend and it did not disappoint the hotel is stylish and modern and in a great part of the city with easy access to anywhere in the city as it is so close to the eiffel tower and the metro i would personally reccomend getting a view with the eiffel tower as at night it is truly spectacular
