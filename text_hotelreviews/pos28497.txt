we had such a nice stay at le parisis the staff were very nice and helpful the location is great its close to bars restaurants and shops and of course if you get an eiffel tower view it makes it that much better we visited the sauna at the end of our night which was really nice and relaxing we did not have breakfast the next morning as we had to be at the airport really early but it looked delicious
