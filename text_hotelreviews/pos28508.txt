i choose this hotel because i wanted to book a room with the eiffel tower view i reserved a room but they denied my reservation without telling me a few days before the departure i casually checked the reservation and i realized there was no reservation i called the hotel that refused to give any explanation and refused also to give me the room at the same price of my reservation the result was that i had to pay an extra of to have the room i booked before the room in total was euros for night and despite the lack of kindness of some members of the stuff the hotel was ok the view of the room was wonderful and unforgettable you could lay on the bed while looking to the eiffel tower it was very romantic the room was clean they also changed our towels the day after perfect if you want a romantic week end
