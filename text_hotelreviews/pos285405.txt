i ve been to barcelona multiple time and to different hotels all in the center but this stay was from far the best the hotel has the perfect location for shopping visiting brunch restaurant bars the rooms are cosy and clean and the staff is adorable and helpful the couches at the reception are just perfectly comfortable i highly recommend it
