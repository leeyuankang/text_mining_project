overall a great stay hotel was in a good central location hop on hop off bus stops just across the road rooms had a traditional and interesting layout staff were very friendly and helpful being opposite plaza catalunya metro was handy when travelling to and from office and also to many other attractions like port and la ramblas breakfast was very good
