hotel regina is a gem located in the perfect spot for a few days in barcelona whether coming in for a cruise or just to visit this great city on your own the beds were very comfortable best on our trip the cubby for hanging clothes and shelving cubes were great for getting organized the bathroom was large and nice to have separate sinks outside the tub toilet area nice high quality soap dispensers with upgraded soaps also liked having a bathtub to relax after a full day of sightseeing the pull out sofa bed was newer and had a decent mattress for our teen the hotel had a lobby to relax upon return and a bar staff were very pleasant
