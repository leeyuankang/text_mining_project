we live minutes away in a town and we spent a night here for our anniversary to get some alone time from our children and busy lifestyle even though we are very familiar with the city our one night stay here really felt like a great little vacation it is in a great spot very central and we had a room that looked over a very busy street but it was very well insulated from the noise the bed was very comfortable room was very clean the staff was really friendly we didn t try the restaurant because we had reservations elsewhere at night and we tried a great little breakfast joint that was a short walk away barcelona is full of great restaurants and there are so many close by to hotel regina but we did take a look in the restaurant and it looked like a comfortable setting
