we liked the location which was absolutely perfect and the hotel kindly upgraded our room because the one we had booked wasn t ready when we arrived which was well before the official check in time it was spacious spotlessly clean had a very large comfortable bed and excellent bed linen it didn t have a view but there was a fantastic shower in the clean bright marble bathroom and very efficient quiet air con so all in all we were pleased with our room
