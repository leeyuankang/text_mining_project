the location of the hotel was very convenient to the passeig de gracia and las ramblas being near catyluna plaza was a great help as we were able to use the airport bus to and from the airport the staff were excellent personable professional and helpful one gentleman at the front desk for example helped us with directions to a recommended restaurant and printed out a map for us on another day he helped us figure out a good route to the sagrada familia and showed us other gaudi structures nearby breakfast was super the room was bigger than expected and had an alcove with an extra bed the room was quiet all in all our stay was most enjoyable
