prior to the trip i was emailing the hotel regarding out stay i would just like to say they answered my emails extremely fast they were able to arrange a hotel transfer when we arrived at the hotel the staff were amazing and helpful i would suggest eating in the gothic quarter and not near the hotel as the food is better
