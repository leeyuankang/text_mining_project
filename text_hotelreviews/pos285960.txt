first off the hotel room and service was wonderful and we couldn t have asked for a better location it s right off the plaza de catalunya so close to everything we opted for a balcony which was tiny but lovely even though the location was so near the center of everything the street was quiet americans might find the room small but europeans won t and it really did have great use of space and with the balcony and large doors it was light and airy the shower was big enough with copious pressure and hot water i liked that there was a water pot for coffee and tea in the room as well as small water bottles daily the staff at the front desk were a font of knowledge and advice with maps and the ability to book us directly themselves saving us time we were able to take advantage of the vermuts dj on the patio on a lovely saturday and we can t recommend the experience enough great tapas and drinks and some nice background edm all in all we had the best time and highly recommend this hotel we would definitely stay here again we loved every moment of it
