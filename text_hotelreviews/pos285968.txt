the staff in the hotel were great lots of helpful advice for my sons who were going to a concert the reason for our brief visit to barcelona the restaurant staff were also very accommodating when we wanted food both in the little courtyard and later when we ordered room service the rooms were a little small tho perfectly good for me as i was in a single my sons were in a bigger room my room had a balcony overlooking the street but traffic noises weren t too bad at all the bathroom had a shower preferable to a bath i always feel the tiles in the bathroom are gorgeous and take bathroom use to a different level delightful we had breakfast in a restaurant a few steps from the hotel great staff fun vibe good food the public spaces are welcoming and generous with sofas chairs tables aplenty and very comfortable the little patio at the back is sweet and good for coffees or meals our flight was not til later in the afternoon and the staff were happy to keep our luggage safely tucked away til our departure i m so happy i chose this hotel as it is also right in the heart of everywhere one wants to go in barcelona
