the staff were really helpful and friendly the room was really nice and clean the roof terrace was a great addition to the hotel we found the lounge and bar area a pleasant area and enjoyed evenings there especially the special cocktails we would love to go back it was really handy for the aerobus from the airport and getting to the metro the staff advised on the best tickets and offered to book tickets if needed
