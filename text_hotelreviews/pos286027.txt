doesn t a star hotel have to have gym right because here u had to walk and pay even extra like feeling guilty if u ever forget the voucher what i loved the attitude of the manager that really knows how to treat the customers that stayed like months in the hotel and telling them that booking com its the most important for them not the customer curious what kind of school she made u should give her a bonus and hire her at booking she is very loyal at everything means money
