excellent location walking distance to all the main sites and shopping areas in barcelona the hotel was lovely room and bathroom were spacious and we loved the rooftop bar in the evenings we didn t arrive to check in until after midnight and were greeted by a lovely guy on reception with no issues similarly they were more than happy to look after our bags for the day as we didn t fly out until late i d definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting
