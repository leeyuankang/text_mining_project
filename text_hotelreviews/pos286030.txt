we had a really enjoyable stay at hotel pulitzer while the hotel is just around the corner from placa de catalunya we found the hotel very quiet and relaxing we even had a window open during the night without any noise problems the interior and facilities are excellent and staff very helpful and friendly one person in our group had her birthday during our stay and the staff brought her a really tasty warm brownie the rooftop terrace is a really nice place to have a drink
