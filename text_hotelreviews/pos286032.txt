the location is superb a short minute walk to las ramblas and placa de la catalunya about a drive with the airport shuttle from the airport and the bus stops a minute walk away from the hotel the staff was extremely welcoming and very helpful for us to find our way around the rooftop bar was also great with nice music and cozy atmosphere we had a standard double room which was very spacious and tidy we would definitely come back here again
