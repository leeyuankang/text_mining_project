the hotel was really good the design of the rooms was nice despite that it looks little bit old the smell of the hotel and reception area is wonderful the hotel has its own perfume that we bought later on the receptionists were super kind and helpful especially daniel in the morning and the other daniel on night they were very polite and helpful
