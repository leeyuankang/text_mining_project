fantastic location in the city we could see central plaza from our room lots of restaurants nearby shopping and las ramblas within walking distance taxi cab stand was across the street so getting a cab was very easy there was even a large grocery store a block away nice breakfast was included with our room charge with lots of choices not made to order though modern lobby bar and very nice roof top bar restaurant much nicer inside than what appears from street presence while we didn t eat at bar on roof top the prices on limited menu looked reasonable our room was very large room had lots of art work and two full length mirrors bathroom was all marble and fancy we had a little balcony and could see the fountain in the plaza from it front desk staff spoke english
