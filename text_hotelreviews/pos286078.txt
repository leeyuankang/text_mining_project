the staff are wonderful and helpful this is probably one of my favourite hotels in barcelona i ve stayed at casa fuster nightmare at majestic hotel service is not great and some other places in the city too which have not at all impressed me the room we stayed in the lobby and the room service is also great this is definitely a great place to stay at that is not too over priced and you feel like you are getting very good value for your money the hotel is very well connected to the metro in barcelona and is located close to a number of tourist spots too the taxi from the airport costs about euros without any bags i wouldn t go in expecting the hotel to be the epitome of luxury it is a very good hotel that i would definitely stay at again when visiting barcelona the hotel also provides free tours of the old part of barcelona through a free tours group this is worth going to as it gives you more detailed information of the old city than a number of major tour companies
