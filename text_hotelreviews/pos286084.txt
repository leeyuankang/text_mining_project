hotel pulitzer was excellent for my nights stay in barcelona the location was excellent right next to plaza catalunya the service was great very helpful front desk service the whole feel and decor of the hotel was tasteful unpretentious and delightful the room was relatively small but we didnt mind it at all the bed was unforgettably comfortable and the lightings in the room could be adjusted to your liking the air conditioning was also very good as we were there during the winter spring transition the previous few hotels we stayed at still bad their centralised system set in heater mode which were quite uncomfortable overall great value for money and we would definitely stay there again if we visit barelona again
