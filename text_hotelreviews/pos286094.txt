comfortable modernly designed very clean rooms albeit not much of a view from the windows and relatively spacious lobby bar and roof terrace were nice places to retreat to in the evening and enjoy a drink although the food was not particularly good location wise the hotel is in a phenomenal location just off of pla a catalunya the very heart of bar elona with excellent transport links
