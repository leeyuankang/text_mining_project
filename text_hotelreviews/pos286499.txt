its my first time using booking the hotel surprised me it is big and clean the staffs were polite and professional we live for nights and don t found any problems even it is not in the city central but it is really convenient to take the metro the station is just behind the hotel to arrive the central plus the price if i go to barcelona again this hotel will be my only choice
