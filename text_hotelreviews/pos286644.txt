we booked the kingsley as a last minute weekend away but we were extremely pleased with the hotel and it s facilities we stayed in a deluxe double which was very spacious with a large bathroom we didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on the food but the hotel is in a perfect location right in the heart of holborn so very handy for the tube and local restaurants
