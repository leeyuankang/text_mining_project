the location was good the reception staff were lovely and friendly and check in was easy even though we had arrived a little early the room was a great size junior suite and even though our booking hadn t advised the hotel it was adult and children they were told it was adults this caused no problem and they were happy to make up the sofa bed at our convenience and apologised because it hadn t been done already plenty of water left in room and the little bar fridge was great too big bath and shower in the bathroom overall quite impressed
