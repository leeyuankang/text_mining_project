good location near to holborn station where my course was being held able to walk to haymarket in minutes to see a show some people still around late in the evening so didn t feel unsafe walking back to the hotel along the main streets good transport links and lots of places to buy food or eat in free coffee and tea in the room didn t use wifi wasn t going to have breakfast but glad that i changed my mind the choice is not huge but what you get is great quality which is most important only stayed one night but could have stayed longer
