staff on arrival were excellent and we had a treat due to a room upgrade to a mini suite sadly the air conditioning failed that evening and this was a particular problem due to it being the weekend of good weather the location of the hotel is superb with easy access to tube stations and areas such as covent garden west end and oxford street great pubs bars and cafes all very close including china town
