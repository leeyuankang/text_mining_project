absolutely nothing to complain about room was spacious clean and well equipped hotel was not too big or small and the location is perfect a stones throw from everything from the british museum to covent garden facilities were as you d expect for a breakfast was good hotel was as quiet as you d expect when sited on a major road with lots of building works around enjoyed the option of air con or opening the window very unusual to find both liked having a fridge in the room
