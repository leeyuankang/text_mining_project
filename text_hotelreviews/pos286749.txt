this hotel is ok but you really pay for the location the staff are pleasant and i had a very enjoyable stay however here are a few tips you can get a good local full english early morning breakfast for half the price by just going around the corner go out of the hotel turn right then immediately at the next street museum st turn right and straight away cross the road there is a little deli called giovanni s and they have a great english breakfast the hotel bar is very nice but a bit lonely expensive and quiet if you are on your own a better bet is to go to the local english pub just around the corner from the hotel also in museum st called the plough it is a minute walk and a minute stagger back with quite a few small artesian shops on the way
