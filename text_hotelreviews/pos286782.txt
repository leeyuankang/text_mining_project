i wanted to be close to the british museum with good access to the underground and and this hotel was perfect as a bonus the hotel is very easy to get to from heathrow using the piccadilly line on the underground it takes a little longer than the heathrow express but it is perfect if you do not want to change lines i also really enjoyed the general area of the hotel i was close enough to walk to things of interest in the cool covent garden area but away from the really large crowds
