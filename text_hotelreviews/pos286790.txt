check in was a breeze reception noticed we had a small child with us we booked a larger room because of this and arranged for another bed in our room without us having to ask the room was immaculate and the bed very comfortable the concierge was also very helpful looking after our luggage after we checked out i would stay here again although the hotel is in a location that i would not normally have considered i found it to be only a very short walk to covent garden soho and oxford street bond street i will certainly be visiting again give it a go you ll not be disappointed
