if i could give this hotel more than points in my review i would i loved everything about my stay from a to z especially the helpful staff they definitely make you feel like you are home in the hotel the location was very strategic only minutes walk from holborne metro station and a bus stop right in front of the hotel the hotel was maintained very well and the rooms were very clean sizes of the hotel rooms was bigger than most hotels in london for a very affordable price i highly recommend this hotel
