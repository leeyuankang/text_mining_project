the hotel has a nice old english feel with a modern twist beds are super comfy and rooms styled beautifully location is key as the hotel is in mid holborn within walking distance of oxford street covent garden and museums also close to the holborn underground station with piccadilly and central line ready to take you anywhere in minutes the street is more on the quiet side so peace and quiet is quaranteed staff is very friendly and helpful breakfast was very wholesome and yummy lounge bars singapore slings were delightful all in all my first choice whenever i m in london thumbs up
