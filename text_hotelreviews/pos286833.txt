smart rooms that were clean and tidy good hearty full english breakfast buffet at an extra cost of available along with fruit cereals croissant and other pastries good value for a london hotel and was ideally located covent garden chinatown within easy walking distance we like walking so were able to walk to trafalgar square shops on regent street and many other london attractions close enough to the tottenham court road tube to make it only stops away from euston without needing to change also close to holborn station too the british museum which was the reason to go in the first place was literally yards away in all this is a great base to tour london
