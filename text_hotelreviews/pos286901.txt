location was excellent being walking distance to shaftesbury avenue and the heart of the west end it was a very nice well kept hotel and the staff were lovely especially a young girl on reception whose name i could not see but her badge said trainee she was very beautiful with long dark hair and she was absolutely superb the room was warm and nice and quiet although we were at the end of the hallway which might be partly why
