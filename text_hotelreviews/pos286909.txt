i can only praise the thistle hotel and its staff we were upgraded to executive rooms when we arrived the rooms were lovely spacious and the bathroom had a lot of space for all toiletries stuff and a big heater the staff has always been helpful professional and courteous the hotel is very central minutes walking from the holborn tube station when we will be back in london we certainly will consider to go back
