the location couldn t be better the hotel has a charm of its own and is well maintained the staff is really helpful and friendly the beds are comfortable depending on the size of your room you might feel somewhat cramped but it remains comfortable bathrooms are spotless i ve stayed here several times over the last years and it s still one of my favourite hotels in london
