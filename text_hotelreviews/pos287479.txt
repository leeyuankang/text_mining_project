on arrival at the hotel i was told my reservation had been upgraded from a deluxe king room to a junior suite i was pleased about this as i had paid a premium rate for my room as the hotel was heavily booked the suite was located on the floor and had just been refurbished it was extremely comfortable the staff in the hotel were all courteous and helpful a great place to stay in the heart of mayfair
