the park view from the floor is great room is comfortable and feels like it has had an overhaul recently although it was rather on the small side it is ok for a short stay i had an executive room and looking at the room map on the door it looks like the standard rooms are not much more than cupboards the bathroom was super small but to be fair it was nicely done with a good shower
