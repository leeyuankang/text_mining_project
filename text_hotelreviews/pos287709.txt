we loved this hotel so beautiful friendly staff and unbelievable breakfast great location easy to catch taxi or walk the rambla we stayed in their apartment sleeps up to with our kids and it was perfect so much better than having to rent rooms elsewhere just wish we could stay longer highly recommend
