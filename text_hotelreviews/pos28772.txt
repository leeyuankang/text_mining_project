it was great being across from hyde park we could walk up to portobello road and to knightsbridge it s great having the waitrose grocery below the hotel so we could grab a sandwich or soda before going up for the evening i was especially thankful for the free bottles of water in the lobby the hotel supplied this helped so much each morning as we were on our way out for the days adventure
