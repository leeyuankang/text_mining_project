the room was comfortable but smaller the location was great it was near las ramblas but in the gothic quarter so it was quiet wifi was good and consistent breakfast contained a variety of warm and cold selections and had a espresso and cappuccino machine the staff was extremely helpful the hotel had bikes that were available free to use to ride around barcelona it was a nice extra we did not use the mifi but that was an option to have a wifi hotspot that you carried with you during the day i would stay there again
