the reception and welcome of esmeralda was exceptionally friendly and helpful although there was obviously a computer problem she made every effort to provide a spacious room with a view on hyde park my husband who arrived later was also warmly welcomed and my friend got a room on the same floor it was great to step out of the hotel cross a road and enjoy a walk in the beautiful park queensway with shops restaurants and two tube stations are very close a perfect stay
