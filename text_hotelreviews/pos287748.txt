fantastic location just off la rambla but near some great shopping streets and cafes restaurants breakfast was fabulous lots of choice and some great healthy options staff very courteous and efficient hotel did exactly as we asked in putting our two rooms opposite each other and putting extra safety sides on the bunk beds very happy
