great location hotel staff super friendly and helpful providing advise and appropriate support very nice breakfast very reasonable price for airport shuttle the basic room was clean comfortable surroundings are quiet and nice you have all sorts of transportation available nearby including the tube and city bikes it s an ok value for the money for london as everything s expensive there
