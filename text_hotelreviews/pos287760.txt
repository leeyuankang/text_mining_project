we were totally satisfied with our stay the location was excellent just off la rambla but in a quiet lane we felt totally safe walking around at all hours and there was easy access to the subway taxis and the hop on hop off bus main terminal the staff were incredibly helpful and the breakfasts have us extensive choices and excellent quality the outdoor seating area at the hotel was a particular favourite especially when we bought a simple meal for dinner and ate it at the hotel
