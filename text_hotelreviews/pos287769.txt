excellent location easy access to all forms of transport used aerobus from airport to placa catalunya and then easy stroll down la rambla to the hotel which is situated in a quiet side street efficient staff easy check in and out large room on second floor no view at all but not an issue for us as we didn t spend much time there bathroom was large but no heating in there nowhere to dry towels but good powerful shower only one mirror and that was in the bathroom not ideal for hair and make up free safe in room and also effective air conditioning breakfast was very good apart from a temperamental nespresso machine which even after three days i couldn t get a decent coffee out of overall very enjoyable stay and would stay again if in barcelona
