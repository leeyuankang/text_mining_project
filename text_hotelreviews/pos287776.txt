this is an outstanding hotel i went here with my partner for my birthday we were upgraded to a fabulous suite with a giant bath double balcony and private outdoor area partially overlooking a beautiful internal courtyard it s very quiet here considering it s in a central location in the gothic quarter fabulous little bar wonderful staff couldn t recommend it enough really had a wonderful experience here we even got a complimentary bottle of bubbly for my birthday
