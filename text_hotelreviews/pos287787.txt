as noted in previous reviews this hotel is in a great location for the old city the ramblas and the harbour just one minute walk from the liceu metro station with fast frequent trains to all parts of the city comfortable bed in a reasonably sized room with good provision of quality toiletries plus travel essentials pre requested kettle and cups were supplied and appreciated excellent choice of buffet breakfast with a range of mainly continental items plus a few cooked things which didn t look particularly appetising apart from the scrambled egg which was good for a hotel mass producing there was also a trolley of interesting healthy items which went down well breakfast staff were friendly efficient and helpful they were also happy to accommodate a request for gluten free items
