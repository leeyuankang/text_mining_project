this is a very comfortable hotel with spacious rooms and bathrooms everything worked and the staff were happy to oblige if we needed anything like a kettle the location was the real winner right in the middle of the beautiful narrow streets of the gothic quarter there are so many cafes shops restaurants boutiques etc we spent hours wxporing just outside the hotel
