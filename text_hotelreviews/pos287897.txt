the location is in the heart of the gorjoc quarter and a few steps to la rambla very convenient i was traveling with my year old mother and we needed to get back to the hotel after being out and about for hours to rest the location could not be any better and staff were fantastic and very helpful cars are not allowed on this street and the taxi dropped us off at the corner the staff graciously brought a trolley and helped us with our luggage also the restaurant recommendations were fantastic
