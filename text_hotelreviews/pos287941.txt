this hotel was one of only a few we could find to accommodate our family of we really enjoyed the pedestrian street on which it was located it was very close to a metro stop we loved the outdoor patio courtyard where we could rest after site seeing or have food drink our large family room on the floor one floor up from the lobby was spacious the kids loved the bunk beds and we appreciated the two large bathrooms our windows opened up to the courtyard mentioned above we were always greeted by friendly staff members before we arrived we weren t sure we were going to pay for the breakfast which cost extra however we decided that morning to get it the buffet was amazing so many things to choose from and a wonderful espresso cappuccino machine the food kept us satisfied until we boarded our ship around pm our server was helpful and kind they stored our luggage after we checked out until they called us a cab when we left thank you petit palace opera boqueria garden we definitely would stay with you again
