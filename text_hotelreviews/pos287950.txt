great location just off the ramblas the room was spacious and modern nice bathroom but there was no place to keep the soap shampoo other than in the floor would have been really nice if there was tea coffee making facilities in the room but we could go to the bar and get hot water and use our tea bags provided the bar was open the staff were very helpful and very friendly nice outdoor square to relax in and sip a sangria but they didn t have any hot snacks just nuts and crisps from a packet but we had a nice time despite this
