it was just the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in from start to finish on arrival we were greeted by the ever so welcoming gentleman with a beard who my husband said several times just could not do enough we received some very lovely treats for the kiddies which made them feel very special our room was split level which generously provided excellent accommodation for us a family of five we totally adored the decor in the breakfast room it was so trendy and the lovely lady there assisted kindly in helping make a wonderful coffee the staff were so pleasant the location is just so so so so excellent when visiting barcelona we had a window overlooking the little street just off la rambla and we were directly across the street from the busiest market in barcelona which was pure class my husband needed to book accommodation for the following night and a few other bits and bobs before our departure and the girls on reception was most helpful wonderful to meet such nice staff in such a busy city it was the best location for shopping site seeing strolling down la rambla etc we just loved it and will be back if only it had been the of july and all the sales would have started overall well excellllleeeennnnttttttt
