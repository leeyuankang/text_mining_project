the location was great if you want to be in the centre of the action on the rambla and have a metro line station less than a minute walk from the hotel door it was so easy to get from the main bcn train station to the hotel or just travel somewhere else on the metro from the hotel they had a couple of bikes for use as well which was a nice break to get around after so much walking despite being just off the main drag the hotel was quiet and staff were very helpful and friendly
