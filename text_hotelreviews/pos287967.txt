the location of this is absolutely perfect right on the ramblas but a few strides down a side street so you re not on the road this was amazing for our party of spread across a deluxe apartment and an apartment for well laid out our apartment could have accommodated up to eight people there were enough beds but if these were eight women it may have taken a while for everyone to get ready using the two showers i was worried there wasn t a balcony in the deluxe suite but there is it was small but double aspect over the side street
