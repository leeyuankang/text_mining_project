the location just off the ramblas at the mouth of the gothic quarter and near la boqueria market was outstanding a short walk put you on barcelona s waterfront the gothic quarter maze was just outside the door also close to metro lines best standard doubles are on higher floors facing the garden internet worked well rooms are modern beds very comfortable bathroom fixtures modern and everything kept clean also reasonably quiet to get there if you don t have a lot of luggage take the airport bus that drops you off at the plaza catalunya for about euro and just roll your luggage down the ramblas or the sidewalks next to it about a minute walk calle boqueria a bit hard to spot staff were exceptionally friendly
