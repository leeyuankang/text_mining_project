very convenient place in the very heart of the centre you can find all bars restaurants and shops just few steps away from the hotel the bathroom is huge and very clean the room itself has a good size comfortable bed and anything you could need the staff is very helpful and quickly responding to any request they even let us check in earlier which was great the window is facing the backyard a really nice garden so no problem of not having a city view
