this hotel is centrally located to las ramblas but was very relaxing and quiet the courtyard area was really nice which was why i booked it however the weather wasn t good enough on our trip the bed was extremely comfortable and a superking size this took up all the room however we had a separate area for wardrobes and a desk area it would have been good if the desk area had a light over it and a full length mirror would have been useful the bathroom was large and the shower was really powerful the hotel was slightly expensive but the facilities and the location were great
