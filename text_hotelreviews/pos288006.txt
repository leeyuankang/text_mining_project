we stayed in the junior suite with terrace as a special treat for my husbands birthday the room was impressively large with tall ceilings with a private outside seated area due to privacy concerns the hotel constructed tall obscured glass walls to this area rendering it a bit unpleasant to use apart from that it was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly and the location was perfect
