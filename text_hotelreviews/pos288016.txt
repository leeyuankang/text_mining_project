staff were great very polite and helpful we were delayed on our flight in to watch the barcalona game so we only had mins to check in and go the game but the hotel booked our tickets for us and taxi so we just made it even tho we checked out at our flight was not till in evening but they let us stay in the bar and still use wifi i will definitely be staying here again
