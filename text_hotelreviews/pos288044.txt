this is a great hotel just off la rambla a perfect location and we could walk from the hotel to almost all the major tourist attractions and shops we did not eat in the hotel as we were able to walk to the restaurants tapas bars walking into the hotel from the hustle and bustle of busy barcelona city centre was like walking into a little haven the staff were friendly informative helpful cheerful and really helped to make our stay so enjoyable we would definitely choose this hotel again
