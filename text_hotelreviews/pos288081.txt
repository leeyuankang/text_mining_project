the best thing about this hotel is the location it s extremely close to the metro and a number of the sites also there is a walking tour that stops nearby that s quite nice also they have a very reasonably priced breakfast buffet that opens rather early by spanish standards as for the staff i would say that they were uneven some were nice and could suggest restaurants and tours others didn t seem to understand why holes in the floors are a problem to be clear not to the point of seeing through to the next floor but to the point that damage had clearly been done and other parts had what appeared to be burn marks
