this hotel was a surprise gem i was genuinely delighted when i opened the door to my room great location in the gothic area walking distance to the cathedral and shopping areas lots of lovely little boutique shops in the surrounding alleys super hotel i almost walked past it on the street its behind a very large but discreet wooden door on a small side street and the receptionist buzzes you in i was given a free upgrade to a junior suite which had a lounge kitchenette super spacious rooms felt like real luxury after a very basic hotel that work booked for me earlier in the week bed was comfy good heating was an unusually cold week in bcn with decent large fluffy towels good free wifi quiet street very reasonably priced i would definitely book this hotel again
