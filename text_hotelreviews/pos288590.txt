the hotel is very clean and comfortable wifi is very good and the location is excellent it is within metres of the volkstheater u bahn station right next to the museumsquartier and within walking distance of the main museums it is only several hundred metres from mariahilfer strasse a major pedestrian boulevard which i would guess is over long lines with shops and eating places breakfast was not included but was available for eur whilst the selection was not extensive as seen in larger hotels it was adequate and we are there each day of our stay
