excellent location in the museumquartier close to the main tourist attractions in vienna the staff were very helpful they were able to change our initially received room in the second night as we ve received an attic room which was really ok but i don t like attic rooms breakfast was very good with a large variety of fresh and cooked food free coffee tea etc in the hotel lounge area after was nice to have
