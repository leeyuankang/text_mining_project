easy access to metro and bus stations just across the road from hyde park great for a morning coffee with the swans ducks and birds staff are quite helpful and arranged for our return taxi hotel is clean and calm overall although fully packed with visitors walking distance from kensington palace waitrose is open just at the bottom of the hotel which is quite convenient
