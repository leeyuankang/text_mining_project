loved the location as i like being near the action but not directly in the heart of it this area felt more like a neighborhood and offered all of the ease that comes w it grocery block away local cafes bakeries restaurants etc quick min walk to the underground metro station of u and u and trams as well very walkable to city center about min walk to opera house min to hofburg palace and the museums felt very safe and as a single female traveler i put that as a high priority i felt safe throughout vienna easy city to visit get around would stay in this area again liked that the hotel offered coffee tea hot choc service for free from the hours of noon to midnight i did not pay for the breakfast found it easier and cheaper to pick up some items at the grocery store bakeries room had a refrigerator and i used that to hold some items i always travel w ear plugs and feel like you might need them due to early morning trash trucks on the back streets and noise from other room guests nearby that might be loud as it was unusually mild temps during my stay i actually opened the window to get fresh air into the room almost each day i liked having that option very clean room just so you know the lobby area comes across very modern but my room seemed to be in an older section that did not match the lobby pictures you see but the room was still just fine plenty of hot water clean safe great location public transportation access refrigerator etc which is what really matters to me
