we loved the location the room was great and while the bed was comfy it was not brilliant we loved the free non alcoholic drinks coming back after a long day to a cool drink or a cuppa before retiring was really terrific the breakfast was disappointing for the price cheaper and tastier to eat away from the hotel overall it was a wonderful experience we would recommend the hotel and would definitely return
