great location for hyde park waitrose store underneath the hotel next to the petrol station tube not very far to walk and bus stops near by as well we made a special request to the hotel in advance of our stay and we re thrilled that it was met as special requests are always at the discretion of the hotel thank you to the thistle staff involved the room was very comfortable for such a budget price in a very central location it appeared to have been recently refurbished restaurant and bar were perfectly comfortable and staff all very helpful well done thistle we enjoyed our stay once again we didn t eat at the hotel as our room was room only so we can t comment on the food would highly recommend for hyde park events or business trips to kensington locations
