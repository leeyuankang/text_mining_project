excellent staff go out of their way to accommodate to my requests from check in to check out they even strived to fix my air conditioning during my stay there when the hotel was full with no extra room breakfast was simple but excellent good decor of the room location is very central near to queensway and bayswater tube stations lots of food places at bayswater itself i only needed to cross the street to get to hyde park
