the staff was really helpful and friendly and there was a shuttle weekday mornings that would take you to the train station if you asked for it i believe the shuttle continues into the afternoon and evening but it s only one way they will not pick you up from the train station the room was cleaned every day and it looked great the toiletries they leave smell wonderful everything is geared towards a business atmosphere and is basically catered more towards a male audience the air con was very quiet and pretty effective watching the helicopters come in was really neat and the sound was very dulled in the rooms we could tell there was one coming or leaving but it was more of a white noise if you were sleeping it was about a minute train ride to get to the main london victoria station which would then link up with the underground service and about a minute bus ride to the train station closest to the hotel or a minute walk
