the coffee was really nice we were both really pleasantly surprised with our breakfast each morning we had an afternoon tea from wowcher com this was lovely the bed was very comfy we stayed in room and had a direct river view and we looked down onto the heli pad i recommend this room there was a tv over the bath and the shower was a decent size pax we enjoyed our time in the steam room and because of a room mix up at the start of our trip we received a free drink token each which included a tray of appetisers staff were great and helpful it was a friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed our short stay i had booked rooms far in advance so we paid a cheaper rate and i wouldn t have wanted to pay any more for two nights we downloaded the uber app and found this to be the cheapest way to travel to london victoria and to london hammersmith
