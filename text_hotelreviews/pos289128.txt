staff were excellent very friendly and helpful there was a minor problem with a room downstairs which had a leak meaning that the staff had to check something in our room even though it only took about seconds they were very apologetic and gave us both breakfast on the house for the inconvenience we really did feel well looked after the room and facilities were all very good
