the room was great i was upgraded to a spacious executive suite the spa and gym were well equipped and great to have within the hotel it was lovely to have a freshly cooked breakfast rather than just a buffet and the reception staff were very accommodating and arranged a later checkout so i could enjoy the spa after checking in later than expected the night before
