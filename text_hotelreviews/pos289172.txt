we stayed in one of the deluxe rooms with views along the river the chelsea flower was the purpose of our stay which was a minute stroll alongside the river away from the hotel amazing room amazing views and the bed was possibly the most comfortable we have ever slept on when away from home we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant both mornings of our stay staff were friendly and attentive and the food was delicious the helipad outside the restaurant added another dimension it was great watching the helicopters arrive and leave check in and out was a breeze and the reception staff friendly and informative we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others
