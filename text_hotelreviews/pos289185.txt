we stayed at the hotel for nights and were very impressed the room was great and had everything we needed in particular we liked the spaciousness and decor in the bathroom and the super comfy beds we booked a room with a river view which also overlooked the heliport no noise whatsoever as the windows are quadruple glazed but very interesting to see what was going on both on the river and the landing pad the gym is just a small studio but adequately equipped so we were able to have a good workout it would have been a bit of a squash if more people were to use it but at the times we went it was empty bar us the spa looked great unfortunately we were so busy visiting family and friends and sight seeing that we didn t find the time to use it the staff were extremely helpful and friendly we would definitely recommend this hotel
