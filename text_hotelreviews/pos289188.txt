the location of this hotel is brilliant it s right on the river our room over looked the heliport next door the windows are double glazed there s no noise and you can walk along the river boardwalk to battersea square in mins the room was great spacious and airy with a huge window and view up the river see photo plus the bathroom was a decent size you don t get that very often in london
