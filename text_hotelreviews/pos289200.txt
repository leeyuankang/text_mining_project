fabulous modern city hotel excellent facilities and great service all round the hotel staff were totally efficient and professional and very friendly and helpful and our room and facilities were perfect we couldn t fault the hotel whatsoever the location by the river is interesting and the river view from the room we had was beautiful particularly in the evening london heliport is next door and if your room is on that side of the hotel the infrequent arrivals and departures of helicopters add interest the hotel bar and restaurant are modern and welcoming and the food was very good and reasonably priced the service on the night we were there lacked a little in performance but the effort and desire to please could not be questioned so perhaps it was either down to new staff or an off night the location of the hotel is something of a challenge if you are staying to visit the city and some planning is needed it is located some way from the centre of the city and the nearest tube stations are around minutes walk from the hotel however don t let that put you off taxis are the obvious and easiest way of getting in and out of the city although we preferred to use the hotel s hourly courtesy car service to clapham junction and then overground or national rail services in and out which were all easy to use with very regular trains the return leg from clapham junction to the hotel is around minutes by foot all round an excellent stay
