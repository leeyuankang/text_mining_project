everything was lovely and the hotel exceeded expectations the buffet breakfast was brilliant as was the service and the coffee staff also helped us with buses and transport to london victoria about minutes on either or bus stop minutes from the hotel best of all though was the view from the restaurant helicopter car parks are amazing to look at over scrambled eggs and coffee
