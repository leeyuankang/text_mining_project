the customer service very important to mention that everyone at crowne plaza made me feel really welcomed the reception team were amazing i booked a small room without realising but at the checkin the lady at the reception beatriz was very friendly and went extra mile upgrading my room and making sure the housekeeping had my room cleaned and even got some porter to drop my luggage in the room later on i went to the spa which was about to close but sara gave us some extra minutes which i believe was after she finish work on the check out i had some issues with the pre authorisation payment but michael sorted it out without any headache definitely will come back and highly recommend this hotel
