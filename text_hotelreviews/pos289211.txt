breakfast was very good nice selection of hot and cold foods the hot food was replaced regularly so was always hot and fresh staff were friendly and helpful bathroom and room excellent just a small point but if the a c doesn t work just contact reception and they ll sort it immediately it is next to battersea heliport but the soundproofing is fantastic so didn t hear a thing
