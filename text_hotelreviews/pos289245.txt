fantastic hotel we have stayed here a few times now but i think it gets better each time the staff are amazing nothing is too much for them so friendly the rooms are luxurious the spa is one of the best we ve been to we had breakfast here for the first time on this visit and again having previously had breakfasts at the hilton and other london hotels i would say it was better the eggs benedict is beautiful as was everything we tried and set off so well with the backdrop of london and the helicopters landing and taking off we would thoroughly recommend a stay here and will definitely be visiting again
