the hotel was lovely we had a nice room overlooking the thames and the heliport and despite reviews saying it was noisey which it wasn t it was lovely and quiet and we really enjoyed it the staff went above and beyond for a birthday and also arranged flowers to be put in the room as a requested surprise which was lovely i had no idea and it was a great surprise and organised brilliantly so thank you all for that when we came back to the room later in the evening we had a birthday card left under the door from all the staff thank you all for making our trip to london so special i never leave reviews but i would stay here again and would recommend it don t let the bad reviews put you off it was lovely the staff were great even arranged a taxi for us and recommended where to go out in the night thanks again to all the staff
