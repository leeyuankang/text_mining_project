the view from the hotel is brilliant the helipad is just below my window but you don t hear anything when the helicopters approaching there is walk along thames river and is very pleasant the facilities in the room and the hotel are modern the staffs at the reception are very helpful overall it s very pleasing to stay in a london hotel like this considering the money paid
