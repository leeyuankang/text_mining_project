the room was beautifully modern clean and airy the rainfall shower was devine the complimentary minibar is a super idea and was very welcome the ipad allowing us to place room service orders or make reservations is an excellent idea too and very convenient my request for a mattress cover for additional comfort on the sofa bed was met with whatever we can do to help this very kind person had the sofa bed beautifully made up on my return from sightseeing and it was very comfortable i only wish i asked for the person s name so i could properly thank them overall a lovely stay and i would most certainly book again
