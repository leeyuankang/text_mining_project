we stayed in the thistle marble arch on numerous occasions in the past but the standard dropped considerately and we stayed in many other hotels in the area we went back to the amba new name to check if there was any improvement we were pleasantly surprised the staff was wonderful the ambience was friendly and attractive and the restaurants and coffeeshops of a high standard the rooms were delightful big and airy and with a nice technological touch and naturally the amba is situated in the most perfect part of london
