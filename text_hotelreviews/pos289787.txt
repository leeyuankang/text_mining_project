location is fantastic if you are up for some shopping at oxford street area however it is easy to manoeuvre from here all over london if you decide for breakfast for pounds you will not be disappointed but it will be crowded recommended to go early reception and concierge very helpful and quick there is costa shop inside the hotel and minutes walk from the hotel there is winter wonderland with loads of food stalls and crazy themed rides that in my opinion is definitely recommended to visit if you stay here hydeparkwinterwonderland com
