it is in a central location right in the middle of a shopping street but the insulation was good that you do not hear the noise from the street i slept really well the staff were highly courteous and hospitable even was able to allow us an early check in to freshen up after a very early flight into london it was also a lovely surprise that the mini bar was free and replenished on a daily basis a nespresso machine was provided in the room for easy access to coffee lovers
