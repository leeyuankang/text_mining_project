it is the second time i stay there the room is definitely look brighter than the last time the room is huge and clean when we arrived our room is not ready yet so the helping staff helped us to get an upgrade and manage to find a room facing oxford street so we can see the view in our room it is fantastic the price is relatively fair consider how close it is to selfridges and to both underground stations and bus stops very nice staff so glad we stay there
