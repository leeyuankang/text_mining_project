the bedrooms were large and spacious with comfy beds the bathrooms were well equipped and having complimentary use of the mini bar with crips soft drinks and actual milk was a lovely treat the location is great and although it is so close to the busy streets it is vert quiet and the hotel itself was also very quiet and we did not hear any doors slamming or people wondering the hallways very nice hotel
