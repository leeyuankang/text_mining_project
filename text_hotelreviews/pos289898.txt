the room was very clean smart and comfortable and big superior double we faced oxford street and am pleased to say the windows exclude all noise as does the rest of the room we heard no noise from anywhere we found the staff friendly helpful and welcoming we didn t eat in the hotel so can t vouch for that side of things we did have complimentary coke milk waters and snacks put in our fridge each day
