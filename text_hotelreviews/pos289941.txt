the location is perfect walking distance to almost anywhere just under the hotel there is a drugstore a small top shop boots next and many more even though the rooms have a city view and we were on the second floor we didn t hear anything from the streets the room is spacious compared to london standards clean and the bed is very comfortable a special gesture i hadn t found in any other hotel so far is the complimentary mini bar that they fill every day very rich breakfast at an affordable price the concierge paul is very helpful in one word this hotel is amazing
