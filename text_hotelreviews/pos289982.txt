i received a phone call prior to my visit to ask if there was anything i needed that the hotel staff could accommodate excellent service i have stayed in approximately hotels over the last year and none as ever called prior to arrival also our friends were upgraded for particular reasons and because we had requested rooms close together we were given an upgrade as well very nice
