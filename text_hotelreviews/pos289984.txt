there was a very good breakfast choice the room was surprisingly very spacious with a sofa and huge bed and also robes and slippers were provided the hotel itself was in an excellent location just round the corner from oxford street and we found about a half hour walk from the main tourist attractions we used the luggage room after checking out which was very handy and were told that it was available until the evening overall we found it very good value for money and would definitely stay again
