everything was brilliant from check in to check out due to a slight mishap during the booking process we were afforded the luxury of an upgrade to a superior room and the executive lounge it was also my sixtieth birthday and i received a lovely platter of cakes and a nice bottle of red wine the entire staff throughout the hotel were very positive and helpful from steffano at check in to the lovely ancunta ronald and michael in the lounge the hotel is in very close proximity to marble arch tube station which made travel easily accessible we will definitely be staying at the amba again and will recommend it to all our friends
