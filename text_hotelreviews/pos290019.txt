room was great nice big shower big bed and good tv had an ipad for contacting staff and loads of useful information about facilities and local area location was perfect as shopping and hyde park seconds away at my partner and i haven t spent a lot of time or money on nice hotels so we treated ourselves and glad we picked this one it wasn t posh to the point of us feeling uncomfortable but very smart and professional
