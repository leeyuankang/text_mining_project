the breakfast was the best we have ever had anywhere and we travel regularly our room had great views over hyde park and we couldn t here any traffic noise with the double glazing all the staff were friendly and helpful it s was quite a walk from oxford street with tired legs probably mins but there is a bus stop very close to the hotel and also the underground i would be very happy to recommend d this hotel
