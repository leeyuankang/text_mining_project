extremly friendly staff only mentioned the visit was for my mums when i called to enquire about payment before our visit and on arrival they brought her some lovely cupcakes and strawberries and cream as a birthday treat we were all really suprised they also kept our bags for us before we departed on the sunday and it was incredibly easy checking in and out it felt like the staff couldn t do enough for us even directing us to the theatre where the show we were seeing was being performed the decor was also lovely the hotel looks a little plain from the outside but once insie it was very nice
