our flight got cancelled and our trip rerouted so after being up for nearly two days we arrived just past ten in the morning dead tired and they did not make us wait but instead checked us right in the first room was kind of yuck but we were so tired we didn t care the next day they moved us to a really nice room on the top floor terrific staff everyone went out of their way to accommodate us
