we stayed here for our anniversary i can honestly say that this is the best hotel i have ever stayed in the whole hotel had a luxurious feel to it our room was much bigger than we thought it would be and was very comfortable what really made the experience memorable for us though was the level of service we received from the lovely staff they couldn t do enough for you we were even given a lovely dessert as a gift for our anniversary i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone and will be definitely staying again on my next visit to london
