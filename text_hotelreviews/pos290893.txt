amazing hotel one of the best in london and the best staff i have ever encountered in any hotel anywhere in the world the suite was incredibly well appointed and spacious and the overall experience was everything you expect from a top hotel great value for the price we paid as the suite was a proper suite with a sitting room etc rather than a room with a sofa as we have had in other hotels very well located too for anything you want to experience in london
