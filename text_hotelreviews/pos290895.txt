good location nice room great staff can t speak for all but incredibly spacious relative to similar type hotels rooms will definitely stay here next time i m in london as it appears to be comfortably the best value high end hotel around it really isn t worth paying the huge premium to stay in mayfair for example when you can stay in a bigger room suite here for a fair bit cheaper it s a very pleasant walk up towards piccadilly even in winter and there are loads of black cabs around the kitchenette which is basically a small kitchen is a real bonus if staying longer and you don t want to eat every meal out
