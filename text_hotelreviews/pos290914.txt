attentive staff very enthusiastic about our year old daughter gave her a welcome pack including crayons and a nice teddy and a lovely lady played hide and seek with her straight away upon arrival then they delivered a cookie with her name on it the next day the room falconer suite is really a room suite with lounge and kitchen and separate hallway and bedroom we loved the dvd library with complimentary popcorn sent to your room would recommend to anyone looking for a home away from home but in the middle of central london great for tourists we live in london but still enjoyed being around the corner from buckingham palace and houses of parliament
