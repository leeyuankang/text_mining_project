i booked this hotel because it s rating was so high i stayed in hotel sacher and imerial hotel before san sochi and i can tell you san souci is as good as them but it s only half price so it s the best value hotel for people who don t want to spend huge money but expect luxury hotel when i booked it i don t really like the bathroom with boring doors but the real room is much more beautiful than the photos they have a huge tv embedded in the large mirror this is very smart and trendy every staff is very polite and professional of course their front desk handsome manager is the best he gave me a little gift after checkout thanks for that
