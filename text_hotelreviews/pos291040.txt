located in the museum district this fine hotel is close to many of the key city sites but the hop on off bus tours are a must to see all that vienna has to offer the hotel is a fine building with clean modern interior providing excellent facilities food and drink these are underpinned by superb staff who are friendly helpful and professional vienna and hotel san souci provide a great setting for a long weekend break but a week would be even better
