the location of the hotel was really good just behind the key museums and within mins walk from key attractions yet still reasonably quiet we had a very large double which was a beautiful room with a large bath shower room and with plenty of seating space it was well equipped and spacious and we particularly appreciated the molton brown accessories and the free tea the staff were absolutely excellent really helpful and friendly especially on the front desk and the front door nothing was too much trouble from restaurant recommendations to hailing taxis even the chambermaid checked every night to see if we needed anything which was a lovely touch the breakfasts were delicious with a huge variety of food and the service was equally good although we did not eat dinner there the outside of the hotel does not reflect the interior although we did not visit the spa all of the public areas were beautifully designed especially the reception
