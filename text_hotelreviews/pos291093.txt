the hotel was a five minute walk from the rathaus christmas market and two minutes from the natural history museum i found the beds really comfortable and on the one occasion i used the spa i had the swimming pool sauna and steam room entirely to myself so if you want to relax it s a good place to stay staff were also really helpful and we re able to recommend some good restaurants particularly on the sunday after christmas when not much was open
