nice hotel in a handy location close to diagonal metro station nice but small rooftop pool ideal for relaxing after a day s sightseeing around the city far enough out of the way to be away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to certain places and access the metro minute walk staff very friendly and helpful would recommend this hotel to others
