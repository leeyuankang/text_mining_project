the hotel was well located for all the main sites in barcelona la rambla was about a half hour walk with the beaches at port vell and barceloneta another half hour but the underground and main rail lines were also close which made day trips out of barcelona easy it was nice being located near to the residential area and we ate in spanish bars and restaurants the wonderful sagrada familia is only a quarter of an hour walk the staff were friendly especially the barman during our stay and the reception staff were very good at giving us directions
