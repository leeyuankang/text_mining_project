during our europe holiday we rated our stay at ohla eixample as the best that we had and we had stayed in a lot of star hotels upon arrival we received a fantastic welcome and a lovely glass of bubbles and during our stay were treated as a vip guest at all times the room was exceptionally clean and comfortable with modern touches and layout and everything was explained very well by the polite young man who accompanied us up to our room with our bags we had a great sleep since the bed was comfy and the room was quiet with no outside noise filtering in at breakfast we were pleasantly surprised and impressed by the hotel gifting a book and a red rose to all guests in celebration of sant jordi s day such a lovely gesture by the hotel and my rose was still going strong over a week later the staff really were the highlight of our stay and went above and beyond to make it a most enjoyable one for us they were very helpful with a smile at all times and we appreciated all they did for us we wished we could have stayed on longer and wouldn t hesitate to stay here again we certainly hope to do that again soon many thanks to all ohla eixample staff
