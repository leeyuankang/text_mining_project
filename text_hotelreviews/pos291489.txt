very nice hotel the service was impeccable the bed linens duvet pillows mattress was super comfortable and the air condition system was efficient and quiet which made our sleep there even more restful we loved the breakfast as well the selection and quality of food was better than what one would expect for a continental breakfast buffet we had dinner twice in the xerta restaurant and took advantage of the euro per person offer for guests of the hotel and we were not disappointed the food was delicious and the price actually included the wine the rooftop pool was nice but the deck is small for the size of the hotel so it gets crowded too quickly location is also great close to everything but on a quiet street we enjoyed our stay and would gladly go back to this hotel
