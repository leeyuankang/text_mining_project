we loved the way the management responded to some of our complaints very swift and effective response which showed how much care and level of professionalism there is in management special thanks to david from guest experience and javier reception manager for being personally involved to make our stay even better all in all hotels are allowed to make mistakes and do make them what makes the difference between average and great hotels is the way they respond ohla is a top notch hotel and management is on top of things hence this makes it a great hotel thanks for a memorable stay
