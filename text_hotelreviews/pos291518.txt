never been to a hotel where every member of staff was perfect at what they do the style and feel to the hotel was fantastic arrived very early so room was not ready wasn t a problem as rui took our bags for storage and then arriving back at the hotel he had taken them to our room and hung our jackets up then sitting on the pool deck with a glass of wine was a very nice place to be well done
