definitely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at all the staff were superb exceptionally helpful without being over the top we ate at the restaurant at the hotel one night and had the taster menu with the wine matched perfectly to each course it was a stunning meal and was very good value when we return to barcelona we will definitely be staying here again
