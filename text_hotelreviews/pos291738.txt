we were first drawn to the restaurant when we stayed at a nearby hotel the food was great and so was the service we realized that it was also a hotel so when we went back to barcelona after a trip to france we booked villa emilia the hotel is also fantastic we enjoyed the welcome drinks and tapas at the rooftop bar great ambiance and terrace setting
