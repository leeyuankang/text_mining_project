very helpful staff nice lobby and bar restaurant area rooms quiet and comfortable excellent location nice breakfast and fast wi fi we tried the hotel restaurant for both lunches and dinners and we were perfectly happy with the quality some restaurant staff do not speak english which creates some challenges a beautiful hotel and definitely will return back
