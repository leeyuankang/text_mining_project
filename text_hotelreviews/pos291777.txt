we stayed in villa emilia nights overall it is a very modern comfort and well organized boutique hotel that fits especially couples without kids we are very pleased to recommend emilia to everyone room cozy enough to relax even thought it isn t as that spacious as it looks on the picture ac is extremely quiet location not very close to the city center around mins walking distance to la rambla but by metro and bus at door step it takes only mins to almost everywhere that barcelona is to offer there are many small restaurants cafeterias and groceries around the corner pl espania is within mins walk restaurant very stylish cozy bar dinner served at costs euros p but it does worth the price cod fillet tastes unbelievably soft and fresh highly recommended cleanness quite ok facilities nothing else except for the bar and terrace but for us it is not a big deal as we spent most of the time exploring the city
