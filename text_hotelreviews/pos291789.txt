the location is about min walk from the hop on hop off bus which was great for us it is about a min cab ride approximately euros or hour walk from the cathedral the staff was incredibly kind and helped with everything there are a few shops around the hotel for bars in the evenings breakfast in the morning and easy super markets to get to the room itself was very modern looking and sleek we brought quite a bit of luggage so we had to be creative with our bags but it worked out perfect i would stay again ps i ve stayed all over the world and the staff here was definitely some of the best
