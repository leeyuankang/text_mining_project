excellent room we asked for quiet and were placed at the rear of the hotel away from the road very peaceful room was cleaned every day wonderful modern bathroom the hotel had a lovely smell from the moment you walked through the doors and in all the corridors roof terrace bar was not open for many hours when we visited but you were still welcome to go up and relax up there and drinks were brought up to you if requested the blankets to wrap yourself in were a nice touch and needed
