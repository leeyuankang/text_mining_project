i really liked the feel of the hotel very friendly and cosy ambience not too big really nice and helpful staff and it s right next to rocafort metro and gran via buses so easy to get around the food is really excellent we had both lunch and dinner there on various occasions and it s just a nice place to sit in the bar with live piano music in the early evening also they have a coffee break tea coffee biscuits laid on in the mezzanine from so perfect when you come in from a day s pounding the streets
