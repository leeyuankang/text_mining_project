stylish and modern smaller hotel my room facing the treed garden behind the hotel was super quiet room was not large but well equipped friends planning to share a room should note that the bathroom is partly open to the bedroom toilet is behind opaque glass however i thought the design very practical and stylish fine for singles couples but may not suit some friends who don t want to see their friend naked i had to leave early to attend a funeral and staff were super helpful to assist breakfast buffet had a good variety of both hot and cold selections
