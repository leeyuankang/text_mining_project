ricardo was a gem cleaning staff friendly and thorough location was not too far to placa cataluna if you dont like walking a metro is a minute walk from the hotel and after metro stops you are there once there check out the hop on hop off bus tours i always do it the first day or two i arrive in a city that way you see everything and the following day one can revisit points of interest for a longer time hotel water pressure strong and quick to respond to hot and cold temperature the shower cubicle is made of glass which isnt frosted so if you are shy being in your birthday suit when someone else is in the room you may want to pass on this one it is a hetero friendly hotel which caters to mainly adults of various ages the guests at the hotel are liberal open minded tolerant and respectful of others
