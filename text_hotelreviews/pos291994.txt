the room was funky modern mirrors all over so if you are with friends it might not be for the shy ones when it comes to taking a shower etc great facilities the rooftop bar mini pool and gym are great fab location can walk to many sites or just jump onto metro from the hotel fab staff and just overall very cool place would stay there again there s also a cool cafe just opposite the hotel on the street corner lovely breakfast great coffee and a little shushi place on the same side just a few doors down amazing food great prices
