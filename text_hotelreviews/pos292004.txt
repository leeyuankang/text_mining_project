everything is great when i arrived i received a free upgrade from a room on the ground floor boring to a room on the third floor with a peaceful view of some buildings the bed was enormous king size and the room was very modern clean and stylish i loved the massive shower and personalised a x e l soap shampoo conditioner containers the staff from reception to the people who work in the restaurant to the ladies who clean the rooms were friendly and accommodating it s not super super budget but not extremely expensive either worth the money in all respects i love the rooftop bar it s a lovely place to relax after a long day particularly if you re visiting barcelona for a certain festival held in august the breakfast is quite simple but pretty tasty i only ate it once there is a sushi bar and various other restaurants almost right next door to the hotel which i preferred the gay theme is great but saw lots of straight people too overall so welcoming and wonderful would definitely stay here again
