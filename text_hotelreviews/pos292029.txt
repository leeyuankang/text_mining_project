sleep quality extremely quiet the bed was comfortable and the bed sheets were so soft and light that you would not want to get out of bed the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful making you really welcomed the location is perfect quiet area street but minute to the rocafort metro station which is stops from city centre and also the aerobus euros stops around meters from the hotel wifi was excellent
