staff here are fantastic for hotel loved the roof top pool sunsets laid back guests lots of english speaking tv options a great buffet breakfast with lovely scrambled eggs bacon as well as fresh fruit pastries as a sole female traveller i chose two as its gay hetero friendly i wanted a hotel where i could use the facilities freely without the burden of man hassle location an easy walk to la ramblas though a longer hike to the beach i was happy with that as there s so much to see
