overall very pleasant experience however apart from ricardo who was very helpful and approachable the rest of the reception staff could come across a little bit short very mean glasses of champagne as well whenever i have ordered one they only pored half lol the sky bar wasn t finished but the website did not mention that prior so i was quite disappointed that every time i wanted a drink i had to go down to reception where receptionists said that they are not bartenders although they stand behind the bar lol
