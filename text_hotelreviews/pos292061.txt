very good location just a few minutes walking distance from placa espana very close to the bus stop to the airport and other means of transport not a big variety of food for breakfast but fresh tasty and enough to have a good meal and not to be hungry till lunch nice and helpful staff place was clean quiet and i liked the design and equipment of our room the pool on the roof seemed to be a nice place to have a rest after sightseeing tours but at the time we were there it was a little too cold outside for my wife to use it although the water is heated we spent mostly late evenings and nights in the hotel but it was quite a pleasant stay good ratio value for money
