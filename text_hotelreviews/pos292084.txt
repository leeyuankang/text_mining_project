it was a pitty to only stay one night i will definitely come back we had a room upgrade for free i loved the design of the room perfect for couples not ideal for friends the room was on the back side of the building facing a park calm and with plenty of light walking distance to the metro stop of rocafort this metro lines brings you to the heart of barcelona within what we enjoyed the most was the rooftop swimming pool which was heated perfect after a day visiting barcelona
