i was worried when i seen some reviews this is a great hotel fresh clean new friendly staff i m not sure what staff other people were dealing with but anyone i met was nice in particular richard the rooftop bar man and the front desk staff i was disappointed the other facilities were not open but overall a great staff and would come back here again for sure
