i was due to take a flight to olbia from nice and it was cancelled and i was re routed via barcelona and needed a hotel close to the airport as the flight landed late and the following flight was early the next morning so just needed a bed this hotel fitted the bill perfectly free airport shuttle clean room comfy bed kettle in the room for that early cup of tea and good wifi
