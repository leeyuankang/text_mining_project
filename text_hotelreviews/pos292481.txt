the staff accomodated our special requests very well on the day we booked out we left our lugguage there and upon return to the hotel after sight seeing the whole day allowed us to shower and change in a spare room in preparation of our flight back to our country we really appreciated this because our return flight had a connection which meant we spent hours flying and would not have had a chance te refresh during the return flight
