beds and room were very comfortable some of the staff was amazing the cute girl from italy and some of the other daytime crew were fantastic and very accommodating when we dropped off our bags early they were very thorough in checking our tickets to even grab a sweater out of the bag they watched me put in the room so your luggage is definitely safe in there the food at the bar was delicious
