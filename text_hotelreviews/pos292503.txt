the bathrooms are impeccable immaculately clean and great sober style the staff is really agreeable and courteous and the free airoport shuttle is very practical for travelers who come by plane thumbs up for that impeccable service also nice lobby although a bit small decorated with good taste i wish the rooms were that well decorated also
