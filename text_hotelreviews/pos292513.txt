room was clean and very modern as was the hotel in general staff were nice except one lady though i ve spoken to the manager about her already the location is a little far out however there is a bus stop literally seconds outside of the hotel which takes you right to the city centre in less than minutes there is also a metro station only minutes walk from the hotel too for this reason i think the location balances up seeing as the hotel price is very decent hotel staff helped print out my boarding pass and have a shuttle bus which collects and drops you from to the airport super bonus
