the hotel has a airport shuttle that starts running at which was great for us because we had a early flight the hotel is very close to the airport probably a minute drive we walked about kilometers to the nearest subway to go downtown to barcelona i can t remember the name but it was a industrial area that use to be the olympic village in for food we ate the bar they had an excellent menu and much cheaper than the restaurant
