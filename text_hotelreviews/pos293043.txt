the fact that the reception staff did their best to ease us and were very sympathetic to our discovery of on going heavy works made our shock a it better it was obvious that it was not their fault to their credit they put us in rooms where we could not hear a single thump or any hammering so we soon forgot about our initial horror once we were sorted everything run smoothly and we had a great and unforgettable time generally all the reception staff were super cool and very customer oriented the management of the hotel should give them a bonus especially the guy who had his aunt visiting and who warned us about the flight cancellations to madrid he should be promoted
