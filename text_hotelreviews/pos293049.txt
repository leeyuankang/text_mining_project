we had really good breakfasts with very friendly staff the pool on the roof was a real bonus a great spot to unwind after a busy day sightseeing the location of the hotel was very convenient for seeing the sights of barcelona one more bonus was the fantastic mosaic the kiss virtually outside the font door you must see this if you visit barcelona
