we had such a great experience here the staff was so welcoming and accommodating to us my husband and i were traveling with our nine month old and they were really wonderful in accomedating the baby one day they even surprised us with a teddy bear and personalized note for her another thing we appreciated was the staff keeping us informed on the current happenings of the city there was a taxi strike the day we were leaving and they told us about it the day before so we could be properly prepared when we got to the airport shuttle line which was very long due to the no taxis there were many people who didn t know about the strike and missed their flights we were very happy that they provided us with this information
