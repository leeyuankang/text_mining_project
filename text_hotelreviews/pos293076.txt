the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff made our stay memorable the hotel is modern and extremely clean there was a kettle to boil hot water as a tea drinker i was extremely happy with the kettle this was my favorite most hotels only provide coffee and the machine is usually tainted by coffee residue yeah for the kettle
