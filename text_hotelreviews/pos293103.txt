comfy beds asked for quiet room as travelling with young daughter so was at back of hotel therefore no view but as the hotel was in such a great location that didn t matter breakfast pastry basket etc lovely but didn t need the cooked element so perhaps a different rate for continental would be useful would definitely stay again
