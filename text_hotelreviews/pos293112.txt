very nice fairly inexpensive hotel in the gothic quarter of barcelona great location to tour barcelona as long as you don t mind walking a few blocks to get to the metro or to see the many sites that we consider to be within walking distance there are many restaurants and stores within walking distance the hotel is just a few steps from the barcelona cathedral and a few blocks from las ramblas the room was not big but not too small with a nice size bathroom staff was pleasant and very helpful we requested an early check in and we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to get into our room before am
