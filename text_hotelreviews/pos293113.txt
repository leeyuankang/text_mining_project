location superb staff were very nice and helpful rooms had minor issues but not enough to stop me going back free wifi fabulous chocolate box next door for coffee and croissant fresh orange smoothies baguettes cakes ice creams etc and very reasonably priced pay to see the cathedral as you see a lot more than on the free visit amazing city wonderful places to visit use the hotels free guided tour if you can as the gentleman works in the hotel and is very knowledgeable well worth a tip pool upstairs looks good and must be lovely in the summer to swim and sit out sip vino and look across city a glass of wine in the hotel is very reasonable
