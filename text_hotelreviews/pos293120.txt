the location of this hotel is brilliant in the heart of the gothic quarter opposite the barcelona cathedral makes this a great option to explore this amazing city our room was comfortable and reasonably spacious and included nice toiletries we requested twin beds i was travelling with my adult daughter this wasn t a problem and they were very comfortable the breakfast was really good lots of choice and the most delicious pastries and doughnuts
