great location around the corner from the big cathedral my room was small and modern adequate for all i needed always cleaned well breakfast was ample but with a rather high standard price you order from a menu huge basket of rolls with coffee and fruit bowl on each table i like a good breakfast so i ate there all mornings many restaurants in the immediate area so lots of choice something was going on in the plaza in front of the cathedral everyday street performances musicians road rally car show so plenty to watch and do immediately near the hotel easy walk to the starting point for tours i took many shops to look at in immediate area
