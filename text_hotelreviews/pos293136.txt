my twin sister and i stayed for a birthday treat we were greeted with champagne and a hearty happy birthday the room was clean and well equipped with warm comfortable beds and plenty of choice for breakfast a fantastic location for a weekend of sight seeing on foot the hotel even provided a free walking tour of the local area which was both interesting and informative
