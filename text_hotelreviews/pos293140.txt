the hotel is located in a perfect location and the neighborhood felt safe it s about a min walk to plaza catalunya where the aero bus drops off and picks up if you re flt is at the international terminal when we left the hotel to the airport at it was still dark but felt safe walking to the plaza cause the street was well lit and many locals were walking to work the hotel staff were very friendly and a room was ready when we checked in at so we were allowed to check in early hotel felt secure and it s in front of the barcelona cathedral in the gothic district the room was clean too there s also a few restaurants that are open late around the hotel and about a blocks away we found a little market that was open late if you need water late at night it s so centrally located that it s easy to go sight seeing and come back to the hotel and rest very quick and then go back out if you need a cab it s best to get them at the main street ave laietana next to the cathedral many cabs don t like to drive into the neighborhood alleys or narrow cobblestone streets to get to the hotel perfect location and hospitality if you re going to the park g ell from the mainstreet ave laietana the cab ride was the to sagrada familia basilica to the airport from hotel keep in mind that the rate also depends on traffic conditions we enjoyed our stay here
