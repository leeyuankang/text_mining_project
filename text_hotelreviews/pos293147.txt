as soon as you leave the hotel you are at the centre of placa nova which is always very well lit and right across from the cathedral of barcelona the beach is of walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants in the area also plenty of metros in the vicinity which make it even easier to get around i don t believe i have any negatives about this hotel
