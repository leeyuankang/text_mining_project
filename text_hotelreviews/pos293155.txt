the location was absolutely fantastic within walking distance of las ramblas and the cathedral it s literally a stones throw away the hotel itself was also lovely huge bed very comfortable and very good facilities overall we arrived at and expected to have to wait til at least lunch time to check in but they checked us straight into our room so we could freshen up and get out to explore the city
