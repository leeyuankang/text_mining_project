the location was perfect the breakfast and staff there were excellent the front desk staff was also excellent helpful and friendly i would recommend a refurbishment of the white couch in the lobby and a better straightening of the pillows and furniture there it would be so much nicer if more attention was paid to that and when you arrived the lobby was in perfect shape as a first impression and please put a soap dish in the bathroom otherwise everything else was great we stayed one night at the start of a cruise and three nights after and each stay was great would absolutely stay here again
