this place was a surprise we expected it to be good and it was actually great there is no view here as there is at the colon hotel literally around the corner and which costs over eu per night more and at which we also stayed at the end of our trip but the reception was warm and welcoming and friendly they even provided us with a certificate for a free celebratory cocktail as our trip was celebrating an occasion the bed was very comfortable firm and the room had all the amenities one needs including working air conditioning the best part of this hotel is the free one hour walking tour of the gothic quarter provided by olga an academic at the university sundays and wednesdays are her tours she knew so much about this history of the gothic quarter and had a wonderful and fascinating narrative prepared during the walking tour it was a highlight of our week and a half in this wonderful city i never got to the rooftop pool terrace so i can t comment on it there is a thai restaurant across the street which we did not go to but the interior d cor looked beautiful but just a couple houses back from the thai restaurant was a wonderful extremely casual tapas place there were many spaniards there it wasn t elegant but the food was great and the rioja was fabulous and only eu per glass this place felt authentic we went for a quick supper late at night two times but it isn t necessarily the place for an elegant meal
