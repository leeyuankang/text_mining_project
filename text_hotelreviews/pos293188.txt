superb location best i have had in barcelona by far step out of the hotel and so many of the famous sights are right on your doorstep rooms are modern comfortable and tasteful terrific bathrooms great roof terrace and the pool is very cool lovely young staff and a fabulous breakfast although initially confusing partial buffet and partial a la carte i believe the hotel has bicycles for guest use too i would definitely come back oh and the gelato place nice door is lovely too
