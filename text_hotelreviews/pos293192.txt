the location is a big asset since it s within easy walking distance of the wonderful cathedral and the quaint shops and outstanding restaurants in the old city it is not close to the beach but had a pleasant rooftop pool with lounge chairs and an exercise room the staff spoke good english and went out of their way to be helpful getting taxis was easy the room we stayed in had the shower in a bathtub this is an issue for some people with leg issues stepping in can be tricky ask if this is an issue they might have rooms with handicapped access the full breakfast is rather pricey at euros per person but it s huge and the quality is very good the menu included cooked selections which were excellent if you are a big breakfast eater it s a great option we would definitely stay there again
