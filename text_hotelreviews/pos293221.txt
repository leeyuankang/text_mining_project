superb location beautiful and stylish hotel with fabulous rooftop pool the roof terrace had plenty of sun loungers and you can also get drinks brought to you the rooms had everything we needed and the beds were comfortable the hotel was warm but air con in the room was adequate enough to keep us both comfortable breakfast was great with plenty of choice both hot and cold food on offer breakfast staff were attentive and helpful i d love to stay here again as it fabulous it was an expensive little treat for my friend and i for a long weekend and it was worth it
