we were on our honeymoon and they gave us an upgrade when they found out the staff were very friendly and made you feel special we were on the top floor with the roof top swimming pool right opposite our room was big and bright with views of a little courtyard below a bath which is always a bonus and of course towelling robes location perfect exit right onto the cathedral square a great place to spoil yourself for a special occasion we didn t have breakfast but it looked great
