fantastic location so central big advantage in that it has a small gym and a good sunny roof deck and pool neither of which was too busy even in july friendly staff with hour service which proved useful for my checkout good size rooms good bathroom generally a good star hotel maybe a little expensive in height of the season but on par with most other hotels in this area
