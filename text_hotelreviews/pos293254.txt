beautifully presented hotel right on the edge of the fabulous gothic quarter contemporary yet comfortable and extremely clean breakfasts were probably the best quality i d experienced in a hotel and the array of toiletries in the hotel bathroom was just fantastic the pool on the roof was quiet in the morning but got busier later on in the afternoon and sunbeds were limited just luck of the draw really however if all you want to do is lounge by the pool this is not the hotel for you its proximity to the huge array of tourist attractions means it s ideally placed for seeing the sights of barcalona the open top bus located just off the cathedral square is an ideal way to see a snapshot of the city the blue route is much more interesting just loved the whole experience and would come again at the drop of a hat
