the room and bathroom were large loved that good curtains that blocked out the light enabled welcome sleeping in as did the comfortable bed the shower was lovely too often shower heads give a hard shower that is not so relaxing the breakfasts were also good and reasonably priced the standard of cleanliness and staff friendliness and helpfulness were also excellent
