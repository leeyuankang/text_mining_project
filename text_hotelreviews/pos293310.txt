i picked this hotel for the location and price it was perfect and exactly as pictured which i love it has a small area to sit and have a drink before going out it s in busy part of town but is on small side street so it is quiet great shops and restaurants all around and right around the corner from the beautiful barcelona catedral thus the name of the hotel rooms were pretty clean and a nice size staff was nice and helpful had a cute outdoor area but was too cold to sit when we were there has a little restaurant but we didn t eat there no reason but were just always out and about
