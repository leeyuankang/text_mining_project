lovely hotel close to cathedral and rambles easy to get bus to beach and sight seeing buses friendly staff modern rooms super king size bed pretty roof top pool and gym sadly not warm enough to use in january i would highly recommend this hotel didn t have breakfast thought it a little expensive but lots of cafes nearby
