the hotel is absolutely beautiful and spotless i would say the only drawback is the restaurant keeps strange hours even for spain but there are literally hu dress of dining options within a stone s throw the area is amazing ancient but clean and safe the staff remembered it was the beginning of our honeymoon and provided a free glass of cava to us both great bed great shower lots of closet space there was a large party of germans going nuts all night but i don t think they will still be there when you go we would stay here more times and regret nothing and yes the cathedral is right there gorgeous clean modern and accomodating salud hotel barcelona catedral nos gusta mucho
