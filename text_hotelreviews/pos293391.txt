a weekend stay the first time in barcelona we couldn t fault the hotel without exception the staff were helpful and friendly check out was but we weren t due to leave until they allowed us to use the pool facilties until then along with safe keeping of valuables and belongings so pleased we chose a hotel that was central and with a brilliant vietnamese restaurant next door which just had the edge on the tapas on the first night
