the room was very clean as the room service payed daily visits to clean and to change the sheets and towels the hotel is located near the metro station maria christina thus the location is ideal quieter than the heart of the city yet close to everything the staff is friendly and polite as a compensation for the delay regarding our check in they provided us with free breakfasts during our stay the breakfast buffet offered many choices from jamon and chorizo to croissants and yoghurt
