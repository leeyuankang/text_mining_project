hotel was clean and tidy we had a lovely friendly welcome and the staff were really helpful we was given a bottle of water and a cookie when we arrived which was great as we had arrived by coach from salou although we wasn t right in the city we was mins away from nou camp where we needed to be and a metro station was mins walk at the bottom of the hill which gets you right into the city for just over euro a taxi back from the city was euro would definitely consider this hotel if we was to return to barcelona
