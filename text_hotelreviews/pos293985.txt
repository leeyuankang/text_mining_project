the location is great minutes walking distance to regent s park entrance two tube stations within minutes of walking to connect you to the shopping streets and tourist attractions the breakfast was really good and very varied continental and english whatever you wanted the twin bed room was bigger than what is usual for london enough space for two people with weekend bags might be a bit of a tighter fit if you have huge bags
