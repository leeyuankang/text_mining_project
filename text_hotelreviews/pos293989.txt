all staff were very friendly the room was a good size ours was a single bed one and clean bonus points for the tub shower combo in the bathroom the breakfast was an amazing warm and cold buffet everything was fresh the location is great to head into the city it s only a walk to regent s park supermarkets and a tube station are nearby all in all would recommend for a short trip
