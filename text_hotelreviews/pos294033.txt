the hotel has a very good central location so its quite easy to get anything or go anywhere the staff were really nice and generally i am really pleased with my stay also have to add that the rooms are exceptionally neat the rooms are not that big though and at times it was annoying moving around especially if you have more than one person around but ideally it should be perfect for couples other than that it is a beautiful and peaceful place to stay
