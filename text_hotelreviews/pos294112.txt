everything was perfect the concierges in particular made my stay really nice ali had a car waiting for us when we got to heathrow he was always prompt about replying to emails and was extremely helpful he s the reason we were able to make the most of our stay from giving advice on where to shop and catch a show to helping us plan our sightseeing and day trips to helping us with our luggage and even holding packages for me that arrived after i d checked out the first time nothing was too much trouble for ali and he did it all with a smile joseph and the guy from macedonia were awesome too always smiling and willing to help whether it was to take and hold packages and luggage or give directions on the map the trainee norma at the reception and her senior a lady with curly hair were terrific too and gave us early check ins both stays the rooms were comfortable and clean
