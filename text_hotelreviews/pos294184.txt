my dad and i stayed the night after i ran the london marathon the stay was excellent from the minute we walked in the door ice parks for aching joints bananas and bottles of water all ready waiting for us at reception handshakes and pats on the back too for finishing i instantly felt welcome i was given soya milk at the bar for a protein recovery shake too the room was comfortable and clean and there was no noise from outside breakfast was excellent too i was impressed to find lovely soft poached eggs on english muffins with hollandaise sauce at the hot plate and the flakiness pains au chocolats in the pastry selection i ate like a king after not having much appetite the previous evening there was nothing at all i could fault excellent value for money i would definitely stay here again the staff were outstanding
