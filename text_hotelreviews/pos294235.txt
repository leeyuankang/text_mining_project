we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel as regular visitors to the city we have stayed in many hotels but this one stands out from the rest the staff was very friendly and helpful the location is really good just a five miniute walk to regent street and twenty miniute a to london eye the cleaners did a brilliant job we had fresh towels and nice clean room to rest the hotel bar and restaurant serves good food and drinks with a relaxing environmental i would recommend this hotel i have already booked my next stay
