expected room to be good for the cost but you never know until you turn up but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it there was a small queue for breakfast the day i stayed which is not something i have come across before but staff handled it well and i was found a table quickly and looked after good location for central london sights and nice to have regents park down the road
