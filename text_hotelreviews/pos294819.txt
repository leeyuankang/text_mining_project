excellent service left extremely satisfied after booking and relatively cheap compared to other properties the staff are absolutely tremendous and even took the time to leave a bottle of wine as a surprise in the room as it was my mothers birthday a joy to stay at and would certainly recommend to anybody wishing to go to barcelona as for the location the metro was easily accessible from the hotel and can take you anywhere you wish to go fantastic location if you want to wake up and visit the nou camp
