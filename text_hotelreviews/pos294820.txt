nice hotel min walk from cayaluna metro statio easy to find and a min walk from the barcelona stadium on the same metro line as the sagrada familliar so overall good location out of the centre but very easily to access hotel was nice although spa is a little strict ensure you are armed with flip flops or you will have to buy disposable ones at a pair plus must take own towels or to hire them dont forget hair band either
