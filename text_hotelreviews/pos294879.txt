good location a reasonable train journey into central barcelona easy enough to get into even getting back and missing the last train change a walk straight down was quite pleasant city mapper helps the spa facilities were lovely the pools and jacuzzis we re great after or before a long walk around the city and a few options kept it interesting the cold to hot baths were a nice touch nice views around the hotel and the hotel itself was quite big and had a few facility options if you didnt want to venture out
