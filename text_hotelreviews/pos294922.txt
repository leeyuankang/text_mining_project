the staff was helpful and friendly the room and the whole hotel was just what we expected air conditioning worked well and the room was quiet the minibar didn t contain anything else than the free water so that we could keep our own beverages and food there that was great considering the hot weather of barcelona the metro worked very well so the slightly distant location wasn t a problem on the contrary it was nice to leave the hustle and bustle of the city centre behind for nights we liked the location also because it enabled us to get to know the more residential area of barcelona where is more locals than tourists if at all
