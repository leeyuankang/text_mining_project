reception is beautiful the hotel is in an excellent location a few minutes walk from camp nou stadium and collblanc metro station camp nou is a stop on the city bus tour we got on here switched to the red route along the way which is the longer and personally more interesting route then back on the blue route to finish tour and bring us back to hotel
