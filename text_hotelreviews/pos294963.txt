rooms were huge very clean fresh towels daily and free shampoo shower gel the free spa was amazing all the staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for you free luggage room was a bonus as we could explore on our final day without bags very close to lots of amenities and the metro aswel as a night bus stop into town excellent piano bar and very reasonably priced drinks rooftop pool was an amazing surprise would be good if there was a bar up there though
