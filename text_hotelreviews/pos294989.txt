breakfast was great lady was making omlette or eggs to individual taste also spoke russian breakfast had orange juice that you squize yourself wide choise of other foods spa was fabulous just a shame it had only set hours that you can use it and no kids in the evening spa which is not fair location was perfect a bit distant from the central barcelona but reachable very easy by metro or bus late check out option is great
