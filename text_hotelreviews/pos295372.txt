room we were initially given was tiny bed against the wall and we couldn t even pass each other i complained got a free upgrade but looking at the advertised standard double room pic it was by no means an upgrade after requesting change this was immediate effect only drawback was that the windows were not double glazed and there must be been a staff entrance below us view was an alley as the beeping entry system and chatting was quite loud also sounded like a building site nearby however this did not spoil our stay and we would return to thistle lovely staff fab location
