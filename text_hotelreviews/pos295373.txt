location was good staff very friendly and very responsive easy check in and check out can t fault the service provided by reception staff as it was excellent room was tidy not very good looking but for someone who needs to get some sleep should be enough if you re looking for some luxury or contemporary style then do not book standard double as you might be dissapointed
