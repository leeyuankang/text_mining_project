my requirement was an accessible room as i am disabled but the only one they had was occupied the alternative was totally unsuitable and the promise of a chair for the shower did not materialise my visits to london are for hospital appointments and i did not have time to try and find another hotel it would have cost another fortune with it being wimbledon tennis time i paid a lot for a substandard room that was not accessible the room given was immediately next door to the life there versions of an alternative accessible room i will never rely on this hotel again and feel totally disappointed that my needs were dismissed so lightly even if a chair had been provided for in the shower i could not have a shower as there were no grab rails appalled at the reaction on arrival as they tried to blame me dispicable
