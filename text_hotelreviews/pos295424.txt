i enjoyed the expresso coffee maker in the room i found the room very clean and actually noted the bath towel was extra large and fluffy nice i liked the fact the room was energy efficient and the king size bed was ample i appreciated the friendliness of the cleaning staff as everyone of them said hello when passing by a small thing but added to the friendliness of the hotel i found the proximity to the underground euston close enough to walk to making coming and going easy throughout the days there
