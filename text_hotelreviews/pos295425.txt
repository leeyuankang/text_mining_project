ease of check in and out and very importantly enough electrical sockets in the room too many hotels don t have enough sockets and as my husband has to sleep with a machine to help him breath through the night as he has sleep apnoea we frequently have to use the one socket for that and also ask for an extension lead as no sockets near the bed thank goodness thistle have sockets in usable and practical places so i can charge my ipod and iphone and my husband can sleep with his machine plugged in enough lamps too i hate having to use overhead lighting in bed but we had a bedside lamp so that was good too there were decent armchairs too
