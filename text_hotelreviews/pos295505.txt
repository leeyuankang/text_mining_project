lovely rooms for such a cheap price bought a standard double room and they surprised us by upgrading us to a deluxe double free of charge the bed was super comfy and the bathrooms couldn t have been more clean the staff were lovely too we were even allowed to leave our luggage in their secure luggage room after we checked out free or charge really close to euston square station and surrounded by nice places to eat had a view of the euston train station but wasn t too bothered by it would definitely stay here again the room service was really good but very expensive
