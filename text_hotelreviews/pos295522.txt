a great location for the traveller arriving at euston the thistle euston is less than two minutes easy stroll from the melton street exit go out the side next to the police post to avoid the front exit steps if you have luggage and an excellent base for central london with buses running past the back of the hotel minutes north to camden and minutes south to bloomsbury and the underground northern line at euston rooms are an adequate size for a london hotel clean and well equipped but look rather tired and well used the extra cost full english buffet breakfast buffet is good value and offers a good selection of cooked and cold items very busy and the staff are clearly working at full stretch all the time leave your table for more than two minutes and your seat will have gone
