fantastic location right by euston station but no noise from trains only half an hour walk to tottenham court road etc the staff were absolutely lovely really made the stay when we had an issue with noise on the first night they offered to change our room straight away and gave us two free drinks from the bar we chose coffee which was a nice touch the room from the first night was not great but the second night was much better looked out over a lovely quiet garden comfy beds and decent working shower the tea making amenities were appreciated too check in and out process were easy
