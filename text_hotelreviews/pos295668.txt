the welcome from reception was great very friendly greeting it was nice that we were given a higher floor overlooking a park the room was bigger than i had expected the bathroom itself compact but functional the shower was lovely and large although it has had obvious leaking problems easy walk to a wide variety of ethnic style restaurants the breakfast was great this was perfect for the one night as we had an early start on the eurostar next morning
