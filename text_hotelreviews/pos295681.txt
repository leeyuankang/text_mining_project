i stayed just a night but the quality of the hotel really shone through my friend and i were so impressed with the friendliness of all of the staff members the receptionist was welcoming the bar staff gave us complimentary prosecco with our pizza and the breakfast staff were efficient yet personal with their service the hotel room was lovely clean and well furnished with modern decoration overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at thistle euston and we will definitely be staying again the next time we are in london
