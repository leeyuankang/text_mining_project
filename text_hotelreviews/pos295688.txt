booked the hotel as a last minute change of accommodation so glad we did the hotel is situated in a great location right next to euston station a great base for getting around london on the tube the staff were very welcoming allowing us an early check in which was really convenient for us the room was clean and the facilities were really nice great value for money will definitely be back again
