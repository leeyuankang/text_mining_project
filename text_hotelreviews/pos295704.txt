from the moment we entered the hotel lobby the staff greeted us and were very friendly there was a small queue so another member of staff called us over to serve us immediately our room was ready before official check in time which was great and gave us that extra time to unpack and go out shopping earlier than planned room was spotlessly clean comfortable beds and great location only a min walk to euston station excellent hotel
