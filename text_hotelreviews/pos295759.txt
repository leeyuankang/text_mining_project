my friend and i decided to stay over in london after a day tour of europe we chose thistle euston because it was affordable the staff from reception to dining room provided excellent service and went out of their way to accommodate our every request the breakfast selection was wide and varied my colleague and i have recommended thistle euston to our friends and it will definitely be our first choice when we visit london again thanks for a truly wonderful end to our vacation
