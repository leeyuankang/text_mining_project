very easy to get to from euston train station and easy minute walk from st pancras everytime the cleaners went past us in the hallway they said hello which i thought was really good as some hotel cleaners totally ignore you room was very clean and all what was needed in a room were there for us breakfast was lovely a big selection of things to eat i will be using this hotel again next time i visit london
