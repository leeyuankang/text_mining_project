a very traditional grand hotel but with subtle modern touches lovely relaxing spa and pool area in the basement which is much needed after a day of shopping on nearby old bond street breakfast was excellent with large portions expertly prepared cocktails in the connaught bar is definitely a must followed by exceptional meal in the helen darroze restaurant would also highly recommend espelette which is the more relaxed restaurant but food quality was outstanding and again good portion sizes
