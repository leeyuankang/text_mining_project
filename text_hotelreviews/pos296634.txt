where to start we had the most wonderful weekend staying at room mate anna first of all the hotel is lovely the rooms are spacious and they have thought of every possible detail to make your stay really comfortable our room could be completely blacked out so we had the most restful undisturbed sleep the staff are probably the best i have ever experienced they went absolutely above and beyond to make our stay wonderful from beginning to end the addition of a whatsapp number to message reception is a great for when you re out and about will be booking here time and again
