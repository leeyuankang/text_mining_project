the multi lingual staff were simply amazing at this hotel and this is certainly not typical of other hotels at barcelona they were beyond friendly and determined to do anything and everything to make our stay memorable from organising a surprise breakfast in bed for my husband s birthday to fetching gluten free treats for me when i was unwell they really couldn t have made us anymore welcome the hotel itself is very quirky in design and is boutique meaning the rooms are smaller than you may be used to but this is typical of barcelona and they are certainly big enough to use as a base for exploring the wonders of this fabulous city air con and wifi were excellent and free breakfast was a good continental offering with freshly baked treats bought round as you ate free lavazza hot drinks machine too as well as free water dispensers with a daily flavoured water option too the plunge pool on the roof is a treat and although the sun lounge area and bar are still under construction they currently have a full time waited fetching drinks so nothing to complain about there either the hotel is pretty central to all the attractions for barcelona and right next to the main designer shopping street i love this hotel and it s staff and would not consider staying anywhere else next time we visit thank you
