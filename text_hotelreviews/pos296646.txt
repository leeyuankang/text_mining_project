room mate anna is a small boutique hotel with the most amazing staff we were always greeted warmly at reception and everyone was always very helpful the breakfast choice was both delicious and extensive and we were even provided with delicious gluten free options its location is excellent just a stone s throw from the metro railway which runs directly to and from the airport the hotel is beautifully decorated and furnished as well as being very quiet inside with excellent soundproofing the air conditioning and free wifi were both first class the bathroom luxurious we weren t in a particularly large room but the lack of space was compensated by very comfortable beds and ample wardrobe space warmly recommended
