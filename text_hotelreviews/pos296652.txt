the hotel was absolutely beautiful even down to the smell when you walked in all of the staff were beyond helpful always making personal recommendations and arranging any discounts for activities where they could the facilities were great the roof top pool was lovely and never overcrowded the whole stay felt very luxurious and we couldn t have asked for a better place to be in fact we spent more time at the hotel than planned because we loved it so much
