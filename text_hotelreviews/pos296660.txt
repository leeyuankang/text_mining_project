the room was not ready at the right time but we soon forgot this as we were given complimentary drinks on the terrace the staff were some of the best i have experienced in any hotel and rexommended brilliant bars and restaurants the roof top terrace and small pool made our stay very special and the bar man was very attentive brilliant we had a junior suite and it was fantastic from mini bar to toiletries we did not want for anything and if we had i get the feeling a member of staff would have been happy to bring it for us hotel room we will be back
