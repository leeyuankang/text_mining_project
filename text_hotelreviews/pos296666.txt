most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in not too soft not too hard our room on the top floor at the back of the hotel had an interesting view of the properties and gardens inside the block the room was beautifully decorated with a lot of thought to style and the sound proofing glazing was first class my wife is a light sleeper but heard no noise inside the hotel except occasional doors shutting busy traffic at front so declined a balcony room the staff were friendly and efficient and made us feel welcome from the start always greeted us first thing and on returning to hotel after sightseeing felt they were really interested in what we had been doing they can book your tickets for what ever you wish to see saves a lot of time queuing and they did not add any fee so many hotel reception staff at other hotels in spain are cold and indifferent these in catalonia are credit to the owner manager nothing too much trouble just ask fantastic surprise to see happy anniversary written on the bathroom mirror and a lovely note from team anna made our day excellent breakfast with large choice for all tastes staff there were also superb changing items quickly so everything was fresh hotel is very close to the metro renfe train station and la rambla and gaudi s la pedura and casa batllo bonus having a sun terrace on the roof to relax on after a hard day enjoying yourself we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone
