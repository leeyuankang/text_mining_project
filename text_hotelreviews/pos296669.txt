the staff were so friendly and helpful we got upgraded to a beautiful room that was soundproof with great black out curtains the waterfall shower was cool as well and of course the location was the best a minute walk from the train and metro only ten minutes away from the airport bus stop and right next to the nicest roof top bars and restaurants
