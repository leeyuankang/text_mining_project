we had a wonderful stay at room mate anna on arrival we were offered an upgrade to a room with a view of the casa batll which meant that we got to see it by night and by day from the balcony the rooms are as magnificent as the photographs we lucked out with the red coral room the hotel was awesomely located we walked everywhere except for parc gu ll which was just a quick taxi ride away
