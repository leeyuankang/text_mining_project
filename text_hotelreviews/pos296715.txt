i got an email the day after i had checked out of the hotel and continued my travels in brussels stating that the person who cleaned my room had found my debit card and turned it into the front desk i hadn t yet realized it was missing and would have made complications for me if i had lost it i was given the option of the hotel sending it to me they sent it dhl overnight and i got it the next day you can t get service andantino better than that i will make a point of staying at this hotel when i am back in barcelona
