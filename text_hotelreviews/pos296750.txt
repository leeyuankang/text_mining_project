the front desk comprising emma eva vincente ivana and fernando were a great help always cheerful happy friendly and ready with sound advice they were terribly sweet and left us a bottle of cava and box of chocolates to help us celebrate a special day the folks in the breakfast area benny and alex were wonderful what is there not to like about this place to begin with it is the location and the easy access to the metro and renfe train the trip from and to the airport to and from hotel room mate anna on the train cost us euro each way and we got off bang across the street from the hotel the hotel is groovy clean neat and new the bed was absolutely the best soooooo comfortable the rain shower in the bathroom thunders down your body and washes away your aches and pains the soaps shampoos and exfoliating scrubs are in plentiful supply and are quite aromatic they even have a supply of fresh toothbrushes and shaving blades we gave room mate anna a out of the breakfast was very good but then it is the same every day i would suggest not taking the breakfast package because there are wonderful breakfast areas a stones throw away we preferred the chocolate factory beside the gaudi battlo building which oh btw is across the street from the hotel
