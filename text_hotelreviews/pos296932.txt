i m amazed by some of the poor reviews this place gets out of for staff service and facilities we had a mountains view yes the carpark was below a long way down floor but the views over the mountains was fantastic with fabulous sunsets you don t get with the sea view frederick kamzul especially were fantastic along with all the poolside bar staff checking in we had a welcome drink we were then shown around the hotel and on leaving our car promptly brought up from the car park and luggage promptly put in our car with an added touch of a bottle of water to see us on our way if you want to be in barcelona don t stay here it s a long way out and we choose it for that reason to chill with amazing views from the amazing pool the last day we did our sightseeing the bus was not an issue for us and along with the hotel bus you could get the theme park bus every minutes thank you all at the hotel nothing but praise from us
