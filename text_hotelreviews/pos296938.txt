great to be out of the city even though you need to spend about minutes into town by taxi it was nice to be away from the madness of barcelona which is boiling hot in summer we liked the space there with kids it felt very relaxing and stunning views from the terrace and the pool the pool is very big so great again for kids the staff are very friendly and try their best to help the rooms are very comfortable
