the hotel has a very nice setting but is located next to a park that is quite remote the website is not transparant about this our taxi to the hotel ended up in traffic jam for cars trying to get into the park furthermore the location is very remote it takes at least half an hour to get up to the mountain once there the view is spectacular the pool and spa are fantastic although the sauna requires some maintenance the rooms are comfortable the prices of drinks just coffee however is quite over the top it s ok to pay a bit more in a good location but or euro for a cup of coffee is too much we decided to take the bus from the busstop adjacent to the hotel to go downtown the bus did not accept credit or debit cards we were sent to the hotel to get money from a money machine it was not there then we had to go into the park to get money the next bus would not accepts bills of euro so missed that bus too then we had to change the money in the hotel which fortunately they did so after hour we had the bus to go down the hotel could have provided bus tickets or whatsoever to accommodate guests the bus ticket was half a cup of coffee and it took us one hour to arrange it
