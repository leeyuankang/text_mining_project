mountain top location makes excellent getaway from crowded city lovely pool swim from inside to outdoors good gym facilities and excellent spa overall a very nice hotel good food in the restaurant although very over priced i paid less in town at a michelin star restaurant good sized rooms well furnished and well kept views are the best you will get overlooking barcelona
