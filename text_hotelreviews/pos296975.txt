nothing this hotel is expensive and non attentive everything was chargeable even tea and coffee no kettle or cups were provided and when asked was given an old kettle but no tea or coffee for a tea bag horrific experience location was actually drive from city center not min only good point is the view the hotel had overlooking barcelona apart from that i did not like anything else
