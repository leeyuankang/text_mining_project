the staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful they made us feel so welcome the location is great if you want to be out of the city a taxi isn t too expensive c to la sagrada familia and the funicular from tibidabo is useful but closes early out of high season well worth it for the views and facilities the spa is great and the pool gym small but very welcome after a day out
