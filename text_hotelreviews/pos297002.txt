excellent location in mountains above barcelona allowing a hybrid city break resort vacation short though uphill walk to the sagrat cor basilica church at tibidabo which has a beautiful interior and wonderful view indoor pool and hot tub was beautiful and warm enough to swim on cool spring mornings we had a luxurious room with fine mountain view and huge bathroom my vegan teenaged daughter loved the tofu and vegetable toasted sandwiches
