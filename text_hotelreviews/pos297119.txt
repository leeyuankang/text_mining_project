lady at the restaurant was lovely reception staff were really friendly upon arrival bedroom was very neat and tidy and had complimentary water in the mini fridge which was very welcomed given the travelling and the heat the hotel is near the metro and all the major attractions were approximately minute walking in any given direction would recommend
