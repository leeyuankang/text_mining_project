the hotel is centrally located we did not like the area restaurants and had to walk a distance to find the tranditional well cooked food from spain the hotel breakfast buffet was delicious and had a good variety therefore inluding the breakfast with your reservation is worth it the hotel was clean and attractive the rooms are spacious perfect size and super well orgaized for travellers to open up suitcases and unpack the staff were excellent overall polite responsive and appeared to do all they could do to satify our requests the bathroom is awesome has a shower has a separate bathtub sinks the shower s water pressure is great very strong the hot water does not runnout yippie so important to a traveller the hotel itself is great except for the standard room beds the beds in standard rooms whether they are queen sized or twin sized beds are as hard as a rock beds are one of the most important feature of a room to be ableto rest in my opinion the standard rooms have mattresses that are inch thin spring coil matresses that sit on a platform base the pain that this type of rock hard mattress caused us was horrible the pain from the mattress woke us up with terrible back pain however the staff were empathic and efficienty resovled this problem by upgrading us to a room that had a king size bed with a memory foam pillowtop and the pillow top of that bed was super comfortable and made all the difference if you reserve at this hotel just be sure to ask for a memory foam pillowtop to be on your bed and you will be happy we thank the staff especially christan for saving us by accomodatibg us with a decent bed thank you
