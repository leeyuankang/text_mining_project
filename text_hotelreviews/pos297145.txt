the hotel is situated in a great location not too far away from the main square we found that everything was within walking distance pla a de catalunya is a minute walk it is very easy to get to public transport with bus stops in the adjacent streets estacio del nord is a minute walk straight down the road there is a lidl just around the corner which we found very useful for lunches on the go the staff were nice and very welcoming we were glad to receive a city map upon check in they were quick to recommend places to try for traditional food and experiences there was a table soccer table that was free to use which was good fun in the evenings the room was basic but comfortable it was also a little bigger than we were expecting there was not much noise during the night even though we had a room that was facing the street all in all the hotel was what we were after not too far away from everything but quiet enough to rest after a full day of sightseeing
