this is our second stay at this hotel so we do really like it it is difficult to give a true account using face images we asked for a quiet room so not a surprise the view was not great the wifi a little slow but not unusual when staying in any hotel the bar staff a little inattentive at times but didn t spoil the trip location from plaza catalunya was great
