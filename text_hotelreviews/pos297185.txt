the hotel was exactly how it looked in the pictures the bedroom was very spacious clean and a nice bathroom with two showers there is free water in the mini bar but no tea coffee facilities but i think this is the case in most hotels in barcelona the room we had didnt have any view just looked out onto the street but we were out early in the morning and in late at night so it was ideal for our needs some hotels in the centre and especially la rambla have small balconies overlooking the street and it would be nice to sit in the evening with a drink and people watch the location of this hotel is about a min walk from the centre and sometimes in the evening on our way back to the hotel after a long day siteseeing we wished it was closer but we enjoy walking so it didnt bother us too much overall a good choice hotel for us
