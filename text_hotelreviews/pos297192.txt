i enjoyed my stay at arye hotel caspe the lobby check in area was modern and well kept the room bathroom was very spacious and clean my check in was a little slow but overall staff was helpful answering questions it s about a walk to passig de gracia and a little further to the catalunya station it was a safe neighborhood to walk around at night many busses picked up a block away i would stay there again
