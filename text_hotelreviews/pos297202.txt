the hotel was perfect i had a really great stay and the hotel staff are simply amazing they re simply the best conveniently located and in a quiet area it is quite close to the sagrada familia to the best bar spots in town as well as to the beach and the city proper i would definitely stay there again and i would definitely recommend to everyone
