we booked this about a month in advance of our mid july trip at a surprisingly good price considering we are both uni students and can t afford anything swish having stayed in a few more expensive hotels before we weren t expecting a grand room when we arrived something clean and small when we walked in we couldn t believe our luck the room was very spacious with plenty of storage space a not so mini mini fridge and a large flatscreen tv with a large bathroom containing not one but two showers one of which was a walk in things just got better from there you re minutes walk from la rambla minutes walk to the arc de triomf and its metro station minutes to the gothic quarter and minutes from the beach depending on temperature amazing the room was always cleaned exceptionally well with little movement of your belongings so you didn t feel your personal space had been invaded by the third day it felt like home a great place to stay with friendly staff and lovely spacious rooms recommend
