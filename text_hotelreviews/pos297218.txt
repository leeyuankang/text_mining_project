the location was good minute walk to tetuan metro station and probably a minute walk to arc de triomf the breakfast had lots of choice however you would have to get down there early one day we went down around and noticed things weren t being restocked for example the greek yoghurt eggs and bacon hotel was clean staff were friendly and helpful
