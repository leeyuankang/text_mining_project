we spent nights in this hotel and overall we have been pleased with our choice of course the location is its first advantage walking distance to tetuan metro station and also walking distance to parc de la ciutadella cleanliness is over average they pass every day to check the room the breakfast is quite good it offers everything you d like to eat in the morning my son loved the pastry the staff is nice and helpful wifi is working well we were not that lucky with the room position some of the rooms have the windows oriented toward an inner courtyard and the view is not that interesting in compensation that type of room is quiet and your kids will sleep well
