location was good it was a minute walk to the plaza de cataluyna which is a good central location in barcelona the very popular street las ramblas connects to plaza de cataluyna so if you walk from the hotel you could get to the gothic quarter in about if you don t fancy walking you could get the metro the nearest metro station to the hotel is tetuan which is a minute walk you can buy a t card which gives you ten metro journeys for euros great price to get to the gothic quarter via the metro it takes about mins another good neighbourhood is la ribera which is a minute walk from the hotel el born is a place lots of bars and lots of restaurants so therefore i feel the location of the hotel is very good i also liked how quick the check in was no fussing at all the hotel room was a good size and the shower is excellent i feel that this hotel is a good choice all staff were also very pleasant and friendly
