the hotel is located on a quiet street so it s ideal for light sleepers it s only a fifteen minute walk to la ramblas the facilities are excellent and the room had extra pillows in the wardrobe the staff were all very friendly and offered free maps at reception the buffet breakfast has a great selection although a bit pricey at so it would not be good value if you only took a light breakfast
