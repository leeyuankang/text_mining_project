the location is very good close to the sagrada familia and the parc de la ciutadella but the street where the hotel is located is rather quiet a king size bed in the superior room was comfortable and there were both shower and bath in the bathroom i also appreciated free water in the mini bar and an iron in the cupboard such a small things can make your life more comfortable
