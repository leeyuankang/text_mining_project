this hotel was very accommodating upon arrival they offered us two different rooms one with a window facing the street and another one with a window facing the inside of the hotel which was very nice since we went for new years the desk helped us plan for the night with the traditional grapes and cava the room was very clean but my favorite was the bathroom we had a standup shower and a bath shower combo all in one bathroom the desk also helped us book a flamenco show hop on hop off bus and cab back to the airport overall i would definitely return for the generosity of the staff
