changing the room was no problem as in the room next to us was a family with a baby and we didn t wanted to be woken up in the morning we didn t have breakfast so can t say anything about that the rooms not on the end of the floor are a little bit bigger nice solution for the bath to have a bath tub and a shower the same time metro stations close to the hotel
