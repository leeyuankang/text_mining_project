stayed here for nights asked for a quiet room and a double bed and received both they put me on the end of the fifth floor i m assuming because it was quieter than being lower and hearing street noise you can still hear some street noise at night but it s not overwelming the hotel was in city center but still a little ways away from highly populated areas which is a great trade off for a quieter room very good location metro is like streets away everything is well within walking distance staff spoke good english and was very helpfull with changing the length of my stay was also very friendly for check in check out the room was modern and clean perfect for walking around the city all day and just using the room for sleep showering i would definitely stay here again
