it was my second visit to this hotel and i m afraid my first visit a couple of years ago was better than this one my main concern was the bathroom that may need some renovation and cleanliness was not very good with a greasy feeling on door handles the fan surfaces etc nothing that can t be fixed by thorough cleaning though breakfast was very good and location perfect so thumbs up on those wi fi is ok in the lobby but not so good in room breaking the connection every minutes anyway this is a good match if you are looking for value for money and enjoy barcelona
