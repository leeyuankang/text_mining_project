cleanliness of hotel and room was great wifi worked perfectly in room very friendly and informative staff at reception taxi from las ramblas to hotel passengers was approx small supermarket directly across from hotel great for stocking up fridge in room in my opinion this hotel is the upper end of a star hotel not a star as advertised would definitely stay here again
