we arrived in barcelona at and had the reservation only from the following day we planned to spend the rest of the night in town even though we knew this would pretty much ruin our first day as we would be very tired we are both over but when we arrived at the the hotel in the middle of the night to leave our luggage we were offered the room right then and there this really early check in or effectively an extra night offered to us free of charge meant that we were able to sleep rest and get refreshed and have a full day of enjoyment in barcelona otherwise the hotel is very nice clean and well located
