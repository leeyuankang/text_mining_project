a high quality experience in every way the staff were very helpful the facilities in beautiful condition the breakfast excellent worth the high price the residential neighborhood location was quiet i enjoyed stopping in at nearby cafes and walking to la familia sagrada it was fun to wake up and see barcelona and catalunya flags hanging from apartment balconies across from us
