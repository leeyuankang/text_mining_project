this is a very smart hotel and aesthetically pleasing from the moment you walk up the steps and see the lovely glass doors nice bar area rooms and very well kept hotel the bathrooms are very big meaning you could shower and get changed in comfort rooms have an up to date tea and coffee set very comfortable sleep and comfortable sofa bed if you are sat waiting for the mrs to get ready
