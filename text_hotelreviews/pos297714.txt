i was disappointed when the staff reception girl said casually that were going to call for a taxi minutes after it was due to have arrived i had booked the taxi hours the previous day and they had assured me it would be fine it was important that the taxi came when i booked as i had a train to catch a bit nerve racking i could have missed the train
