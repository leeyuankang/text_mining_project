located just a few minute walk from the dlr deptford this hotel provides the perfect location for those wanting to stay just outside of busy central london the staff were very friendly and attentive breakfast was great and the hotel itself is very modern and well decorated the warm welcome cookie was a nice touch the room was very pleasant and the beds were certainly comfortable the bathroom was large and the shower was good due to the location we were able to enjoy a very peaceful nights sleep and would certainly stay again the hotel has a secure car park that you can use for a day which is a little pricey but fairly competitive for london
