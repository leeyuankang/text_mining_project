i was greeted well and when i asked to just view the room before taking my luggage in the manager guessed that i was exhausted and did not want to deal with the heavy case straight away and brought it up to my room for me the staff were friendly and confident and i like that the tipping system in on the receipt so it gets added to the bill i was put in a new built room so it was fresh the food was amazing and i basically waited to eat in the evening at the hotel they have room service which is perfect for me the room lighting is controlled by remote i had a king room with complimentary drinks and a coffee machine and kettle and plenty of space to move around the plugs have usb portholes so you do not need an adapter there is a huge and comfortable bar at the hotel and had i not been so exhausted i would have spent plenty of time in there i stayed for two days and i came here because i was staying at the stay city apartments round the corner and could not stand another night at that place i wish i had moved here sooner this hotel is great and i would return
