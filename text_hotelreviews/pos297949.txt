absolutely beautiful hotel with incredible staff we arrived at and were met by lovely receptionists who booked us quickly into our room along with very yummy chocolate chip cookies believe me take them when they offer we asked for more the following day we were going to the to watch bruno mars and were running behind schedule so i was panicking when we arrived however the receptionists couldn t have put me more at ease they checked us in quickly and escorted us to our room the room itself was perfect a lovely size for the two of us i went with my boyfriend and was spotless it had everything you would need for an overnight stay we even were provided with toothbrushes at our request after forgetting ours and it was no bother at all to the staff they were constantly smiling and very friendly for the price i paid for the room i would recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful hotel to stay in uber s are available within minutes of ordering and i honestly cannot fault the hotel only thing i would say is i wish i ordered room service as the food looked incredible it was a minute uber to westminster which i think was which was was ideal we spent the whole day being tourists and had a fabulous trip away mainly done to our stay at doubletree
