we found this to be a great hotel great location min walk from marylebone station min walk from baker st underground loads of bars cafes restaurants locally if you don t want to go far exceptionally friendly and helpful staff from the concierges to reception housekeeping staff at breakfast mihara i think and the manager very accommodating nice clean room comfortable bed good sized bathroom good bar cafe area at front of house had a quiet room to the back of the hotel which was good overall i would overlook the minor quibbles and still give an excellent recommended we will definitely return
