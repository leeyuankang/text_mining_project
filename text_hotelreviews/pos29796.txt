i would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to go back there lovely clean and comfortable rooms apart from the duvet and super bathroom with a decent sized bath and a great breakfast too the manager fatmir was excellent all the staff were friendly but he really took the time to ensure our stay was perfect
