the staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was perfect the room was particularly large especially for the price and the beds were pretty comfortable even the strange sliding glass door for the bathroom was ok the frost treatment was enough for our privacy and we figured out a way to use a towel to keep it from sliding open accidentally
