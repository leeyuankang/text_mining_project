beautiul lobby and stairwell staff were second to none very accommodating and very helpful anything they could do they did it was a pleasure to deal with them due to engineering work n the tram lines we weren t sure on how to get to pancras train station so asked for some advice they booked us very reasonable transport from the hotel no hesitation then rearranged the time as i had given the wrong time for departure again this was no issue at all the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable could see the greenwich observatory from our window which was a nice little bonus also the bathroom was lovely
