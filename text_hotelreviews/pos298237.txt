staff extremely helpful my room was on the floor so had an excellent view over london comfortable bed shower easy to use and hot as a lone female traveller can often feel intimidated having a drink in a bar or dinning alone but i felt very comfortable and the staff could not have been more friendly and kind i thoroughly enjoyed my night stay would definitely recommend this hotel
