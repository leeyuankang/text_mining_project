all members of staff from reception to the wait staff were very polite extremely courteous and so helpful the room was lovely and room service arrived extremely quickly breakfast was well cooked and there was plenty to chose from making it well worth the extra fee i managed to get an excellent deal so it far outshone the other hotels available the sherlock holmes books in the bedside table was a cute touch
