the room was very clean and bed was really comfy the staff were really pleasant my only complaint was we got a drink at the bar to take to the room and there was a sevice charge put on of optional bit your not actually informed about it in the place in fairness the manager did phone us within a few minutes of the complaint other than that the breakfast was lovely and location fantastic
