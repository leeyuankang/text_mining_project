i didn t try the breakfast but the hotel now has a cosy pub dining area and terrace if you stay here you ll find the staff very friendly and helpful its actually closer to the city center than it appears the area its situated in is beautiful and the walk into the center was lovely if needed the tram stop around the corner will take you to all areas of the city a fantastic find of a hotel ive stayed in a few in amsterdam and this is the best large clean room and large balcony
