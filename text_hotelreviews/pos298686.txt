we had an amazing room comfortable bed and pillows amazing bathroom and shower helpful friendly staff and a great restaurant after travelling from other countries coming here we could really relax be comfortable and recharge for more travels we planned to stay one night and treated ourselves to a second night in the same room with no fuss during high season we hired a bike from reception and had easy access to anything on foot when we return to amsterdam we will not hesitate to come back here again highly recommended
