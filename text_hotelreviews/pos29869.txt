staff were first class and nothing was too much trouble the ground floor public areas are spacious and pleasant to be in we only had one meal in the hotel restaurant and that was a dinner of excellent quality with great service really good location a stones throw from regents park and with lots of options to dine out close by liked that we were able to leave our luggage for a few hours prior to later departure from london would definitely stay again
