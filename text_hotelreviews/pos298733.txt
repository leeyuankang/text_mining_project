the room was a wonderful surprise when we walked in very spacious beautifully decorated which goes for the entire hotel best hotel bed i ve ever slept in and big bathroom with a great shower the staff was very friendly and always keen to help with any questions be it about the room or about food recommendations in the city when you arrive before check in or want to explore the city some more after checking out they safely store your luggage at the reception for as long as you want the tram station where you can take trams to sloterdijk station and to the city centre is only a minute walk away even though there are no breakfast facilities and mini bar yet the hotel easily compensated this by offering two free drinks in the bar next door a breakfast deal in a nearby espressobar and coffee tea water and some snacks in the room so this didn t bother us at all would certainly recommend
