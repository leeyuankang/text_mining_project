the hotel is very new so feels like you are first person who entered the room rooms are very spacious with nice terrace and lounge chair staff was extremely friendly at first i got a room with twin beds but they change the room immediately on my request very polite and caring they offered us a hour later check out and some sale for the next stay due to some inconveniences
