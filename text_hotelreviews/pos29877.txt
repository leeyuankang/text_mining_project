the staff were so welcoming helpful and friendly this is an older historic building so it has some quirks the subtle sherlock holmes touches were nice loved that the rooms have electrical outlets for us european and british appliances our room had lots of space more than i expected and was located at the back of the building so no street nose the breakfast buffet was very english and plentiful the location was perfect a short walk or bus ride to oxford street shopping blocks from baker st tube for quick access to the rest of london and wembley stadium lots of fast food eateries and convenience stores close by we will definitely stay here again when visiting london
