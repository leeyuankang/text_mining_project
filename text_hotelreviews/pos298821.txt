each room is a suite at this hotel i stayed here before quite a few years ago when it was the conrad hilton nothing has changed in the rooms decor wise which is no bad thing as the rooms are perfectly laid out all fixtures and fittings are of high quality great water pressure for the showers some nice restaurants on the fulham road within easy walking distance
