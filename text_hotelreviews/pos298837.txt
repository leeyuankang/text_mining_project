the marina view suite was excellent with a lovely view of the boats from the balcony and the comfortable sitting room the room was very quiet the reception staff and concierge and doormen were very friendly and helpful it was nice to walk around the marina and then along the river there is a good pub close by and a little walk to the overland train station imperial wharf to get into the city centre and also a little shop which is very convenient
