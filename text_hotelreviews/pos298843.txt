loved the room very spacious comfortable and quiet balcony gave a lovely spot to have a morning cuppa staff very helpful especially paul the concierge as we were expecting some tickets and he delivered them to us personally amazing to see the chelsea team leaving for the match an added bonus we weren t expecting food also excellent along with the service
