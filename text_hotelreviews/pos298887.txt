the staff were extremely professional but also friendly and welcoming at the same time this was apparent from the moment we entered during check in and throughout our stay the rooms we had whilst a little dated in decor and repair were of a good standard beds were really comfortable and room facilities great with a well stocked bar the staff arranged interconnecting rooms for our family which really worked for us no complaints
