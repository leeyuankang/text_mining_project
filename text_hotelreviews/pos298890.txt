hotel room overlooked the marina and was very quiet giving good night s sleep we upgraded to a marina suite well worth doing as not only had the separate bedroom bathroom wc but also the extra space with easy chairs fridge tea and coffee making facility just a few minutes walk from imperial wharf station through the exceptional design centre we walked to most of the attractions we wanted to visit or else jumped on a bus which was about a minute walk away
