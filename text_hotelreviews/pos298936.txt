location was very convenient for the chelsea flower show just a short taxi ride away the hotel has its own car park also i booked a marina view room which was a lovely room with a bathroom toilet and a separate toilet it wasn t exactly a marina view since the first floor room overlooked the large roof top expanse of the roof below which was a little disappointing but then we were only there for a night
