lovely older hotel placed by chelsea hsrbour a lovely spot for stylish yachts and boats right in london a good and well appointed facility however somewhat off the beaten track even the tube is overland a good hotel nevertheless if you don t mind being far away from central london ideal if you are an interior designer or interested in design as its placed right in the heart of the design district an enjoyable stay nevertheless
