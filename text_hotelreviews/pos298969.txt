nothing we didn t like about this hotel though i would go as far as to nothing we didn t love the hotel was amazing and we have stayed in a lot of hotels throughout my life all the staff were faultless and the attention respect they gave to us was second to none if i could give this hotel more than a score we honestly would lara the lady on reception was amazing and made us feel like royalty and couldn t have done anymore to have made the stay more enjoyable this has to be one of our favourite hotels in the whole world which we have stayed in
