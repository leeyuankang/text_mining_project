we stayed for a weekend for my fiance s birthday and had an amazing trip great suite with a great harbour view the staff really took care of us by leaving a beautiful happy birthday dessert and message in our room upon arrival and every time we left we always came back to a clean and fully stocked room the location is lovely and quiet which makes a lovely change to staying in london
