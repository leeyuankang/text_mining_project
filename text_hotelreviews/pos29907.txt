great location and value for central london i just like the feel of this hotel several restaurants outside in walking distance and great service ask for a room with a shower room only i had a room with a desk so i could work as well food was good in general and there is an amazing coffee shop next door that sells healthy food a really good old school pub is around the corner as well easy to get a taxi and min walk to tube great value
