location is amazing close to some great restaurants and cafes bus routes and the tube can walk to oxford street hotel is clean and staff are pleasant the bar is open throughout the day for hotel guests which was a great plus would recommend a stay if you can secure an executive suite in the new wing we snacked a couple of times at the bar and the food was good the receptionists were helpful with hailing cabs and helping with luggage the rooms were cleaned well every day tv had a good range of channels bathrooms were spacious and clean and good water pressure in the showers new wing executive suites had a cool remote control to manage lights and blinds
