we only stayed for the night with the little ones while but we were very impressed by the room we booked a suite for and it was large and spacious enough to spread out in with the kids beds in another area of the room breakfast was great as was the evening meal breakfast was actually much cheaper to purchase while we were at the hotel so thats worth considering before booking ahead
