the staff were professional and pro active the location of the hotel is minutes walking distance to oxford street and close to tube station my family booked two studio rooms which were spacious and certainly met our needs we were able to keep a room and have late checkout on an hourly rate cannot comment on food at the hotel our family enjoyed many of the restaurants in close proximity to the hotel
