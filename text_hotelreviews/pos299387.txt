the fact that i was in the biggest and best room they had which also had a balcony was an advantage but i then came to realize that it was not value for money at all as i could have booked a cheaper hotel with better facilities the balcony has no view and its useless yes the hotel is close to city center but i could have found a better hotel closer and much better than this one
