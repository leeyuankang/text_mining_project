the hotel is really close to the hospital clinic metro station so that helps a lot to get around breakfast was good with a lot of options as for the room it was the first time i requested a double bed and actually received it not separate beds covered in sheet we really enjoyed the bed pillows those were comfortable all in all everything was nice and clean
