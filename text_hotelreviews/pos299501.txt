smallish characturful hotel very good location out of the mass tourist areas but close to metro and restaurants and cafes room was good size we had a balcony and quiet rooftop terrace great to come back and relax after a hot day around the city staff extremely friendly and helpful especially antonio who made our stay a pleasure
