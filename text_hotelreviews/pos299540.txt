we stayed here for nights prior to cruising with rci for days we loved the location close to many restaurants and to the metro there is a nice little cafe next door that has wonderful muffins and sandwiches that my husband and i enjoyed we found the bed very comfortable and we enjoyed the balcony too the front desk staff were wonderful they were always friendly greeting us when we left and returned to our room and they were more than happy to give directions
