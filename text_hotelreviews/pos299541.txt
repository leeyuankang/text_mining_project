the best thing about my stay at this hotel is the food very good one of the best breakfasts i ve had in all hotels i ve stayed in europe the room is of good size big by european standards i think and the bathroom was modern it was too bad i didn t get to check out their rooftop pool area so i can t comment about that the area is safe and just a short blocks walk to the metro there was a also a bus stop nearby which we took to go to barceloneta all in all i had a good stay
