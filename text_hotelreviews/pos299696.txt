the room was very very good a lot of space a good view la sagrada fam lia and the location was really good near the monumental underground station and also near to some bus stops that can take you to a lot of turistic places one of the main qualities of the hotel is the staff very helpful and pro active you can also buy tickets for some atractions in the city definitely a place to come back we had a great experience
