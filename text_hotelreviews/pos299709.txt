the rooms were clean beds comfortable and location amazing i made a request a few weeks before arrival to see if my family could be placed in a room with a view of sagrada famailia the hotel kindly accommodated and we were placed in a room on the floor with a direct view of the church it was amazing staff was very friendly and helpful i was traveling as part of a trio and requested that a roll away bed be added to our room a bed was provided but the mattress was limp and squeaky you could feel each spring in the mattress we asked the staff to replace the mattress and they quickly complied with a much nicer and newer bed
