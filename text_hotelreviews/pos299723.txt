the staff are very friendly they explained how to get around the city helped us book tickets to the major attractions and recommended places to eat the hotel is very close to the sagrada familia although far from the city centre cataluyna square however transport is excellent in barcelona so not too bad go to restaurant nogal near by and try the seafood paella grilled seafood platter and seafood soup it is an excellent traditional spanish restaurant
