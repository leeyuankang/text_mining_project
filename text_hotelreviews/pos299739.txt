the staff were very friendly and very helpful we could buy tickets for venues and the tour bus in advance from the hotel so we did not have to queue for ages the rooms were very clean had fresh towels every day and we could see a little bit of the sagrada familia spires from our window the hotel is located at the corner of diagonal and marina so it is very busy and you can hear a bit of the traffic it does however feel very open and not cramped like in the old city there are a few souvenir shops and restaurants near the sagrada as well as a stop for the tour bus if you are after a lot of shops and restaurants on your doorstep this is not the place for you we were very happy with the location and did a lot of walking miles in one day alone which is the best way to explore take pictures
