was upgraded to the suite which was a fantastic treat the view from the balcony was exceptional overlooking the sagrada de familia staff were so helpful giving us directions and tips whenever we needed them the location of the hotel was ideal located just outside the monumental metro stop and blocks from the sagrada would definitely return to this hotel and would highly recommend it
