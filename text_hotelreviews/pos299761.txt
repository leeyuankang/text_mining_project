the welcome from lauri we got when we arrived and the helpful way all reception staff were through the week also bedroom staff did great work it s location is excellent for visiting all major sights especially close to sagrada familia which was seen from our top bedroom floor we asked for quiet room and got it in eventhough the hotel is close to a main square the noise was not bad at night the hotel was nice and calm
