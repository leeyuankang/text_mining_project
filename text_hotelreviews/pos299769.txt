we enjoyed our stay in this pleasant hotel in barcelona the staff were pleasant and extremely helpful upon arrival one of us was ill and they helped us get into the room in advance of check in time the next day when we needed medical attention they called the doctor and made sure the doctor was able to speak english since our spanish was limited they also booked our transportation to the airport excellent customer service and care it was easy to find this location as it is on a main street even though around the corner there is some grafitti we felt safe in this area it s a short walk to la sagrada so it s convenient to see it multiple times of the day easily accessible by taxi or the metro system as well
