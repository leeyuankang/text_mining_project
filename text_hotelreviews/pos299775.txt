at the first night we got a room for handycaps which was owful and they could not give us another room since the hotel was fully booked in the morning we asked to move again and the staff were really kind and helpful immediate they found us a better room at a higher floor overall the hotel was great very value for money great location minute from the metro and blocks from sagrada familia we will definitely come again one day
