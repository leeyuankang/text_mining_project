our room was really comfortable and clean lots of extra pillows and the walk in wardrobe area was a really nice extra breakfast was really nice they had gluten free options bread baguette which needed mins to defrost heat up lemon madeleines and biscuits pastries fruit bacon etc which were all very tasty jacuzzi was great after a long day of walking around and sight seeing and the balcony was nice to sit out on it was definitely worth upgrading the room to get the extra space balcony and jacuzzi staff were lovely and very helpful throughout our stay
