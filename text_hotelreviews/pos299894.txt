i stayed in room interior for nights and it was just perfect i had a window overlooking the courtyard which isn t normally what i like but it was nice i usually prefer an exterior room so i can people watch they staff felt this would be better this time and in the morning i found out why there was quite a bit of street construction going on which i could not hear it at all in my room my friends had an exterior room and even with the window closed they could hear it so i am thankful for the interior room of course noise like that is out of the control of the hotel but it was nice of them to consider my sleep the rooms were very well appointed and modern i love having the coat hooks as you walk into the room and the lobby is very nice as well the staff was always friendly the location was great it is just min walk from plaza espana with the arena shopping and the metro the night time fountain show is great up near the museums and it was a safe area to walk around at night i also liked that the airport bus or was min direct from airport to plaza espana for only return from there it was just a few blocks walk to the hotel
