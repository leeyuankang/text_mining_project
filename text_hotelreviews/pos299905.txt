brilliant location close to at least metro stops within walking distance we walked down the road each morning for a lovely breakfast of coffee fresh orange juice and a fresh pastry very cheap next to a big food market the metro was able to get us to all the places we wished to see quick and easy buy the trip card for great value had a great view of monument a colon from our room window
