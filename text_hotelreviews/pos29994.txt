great location near baker street tube and oxford street not far i was amazed at the friendliness of all staff they couldn t help enough customer service was of a very high level i was given a choice of rooms on my arrival there are some facing baker street and as a listed building still have old windows that don t closes tightly this is resolved with secondary glazing rooms are quirky and are all different some have steps down into them and double glazing others have wooden or carpet flooring rooms at the back are quiet but make sure you are not near the kitchen as there was noise from an extractor and air conditioning all night the room was very warm and we couldn t open the window because of outside noise the bed was really comfortable and there were tea making facilities and television etc you can choose pillows and whether you want down or synthetic air conditioning has heat only in winter and cold in winter we didn t book the buffet breakfast but you will be offered it on checking in for each per day we took it and it was lovely the chef will cook eggs to order the only caviat is that i love porridge and it was only on the a la carte menu for would return with a big bath towel to hang over the bathroom door
