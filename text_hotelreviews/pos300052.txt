the location was right next to towrr bridge tube station and within a few minutes walk of tower bridge the tower of london and the river piccadilly was about in a cab away for new year s day parade but we were quite happy to stay local the first day we were ice skating in front of the tower of london then went for a burger very close by are zizzi and gourmet burger company what we also discovered was across the road at keepers you can buy full breakfast including cooked breakfast for per adult and children free whereas a continental breakfast at the hotel was an adult and half that price for a child we didn t try the hotel breakfast however did have room service which was reasonably priced and tasty we didn t eat in any of the restaurants as i do t like sushi and the other restaurant looked so empty and dreary isis bar was friendly and nice to sit with a glass of wine the hotel itself was lively spa and pool really nice our room was huge which was a twin double and also a cot was provided nothing was too much trouble and even when my pushchair inner tube had a hole in it the hotel leant me a pushchair for the duration of my stay days nights apart from the cost of the breakfast and the restaurant looking so uninviting the hotel was brilliant great location for three tower of london thames cruises and tower bridge definitely reccomeneded keepers across the road for breakfast and and evening meal and drink room very clean and comfortable and we had a lovely stay for new year if you want the west end piccadilly etc it s all accessible by the tube but we cabbed it everywhere as it was easier with small children and also visited hyde park winter wonderland which cost around i also had a facial in the spa which was very nice and the pool was lovely towels are provided for free but no robes if only swimming changing area clean and tidy i would definitely stay again
