we have stayed here earlier and the staff and services are excellent as is the morning breakfast the location is less than a minute walk down fro the russell square tube station making it super easy to go for theatre shows and come back safely even if it is late it is next to brunswick square which has everything you could want including a gorgeous second hand bookshop and a sort of food fair every saturday morning
