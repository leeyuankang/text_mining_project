the staff in the restaurant were incredibly helpful and thoughtful in their approach which made a huge difference to the stay there was ample space in the room for a travel cot which the hotel staff provided and set up free of charge and with a minimum of fuss breakfast was excellent the wifi was fast and easy to connect to all in all a superb experience
