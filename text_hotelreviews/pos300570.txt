great location for seeing west end shows british museum soho covent garden and easy access on the picadilly line to everything else breakfast was great big selection and very well organized so that you got a seat with your family and hot drinks brought to your table impressed that the staff was able to manage large groups efficiently even at the busiest times would definitely stay here again
