most quiet hotel room we have ever had great access to the tube friendly helpful staff nice breakfast buffet free wi fi slow and frustrating cheaper to buy a data sim card if staying for a few days rather than paying for hotel upgrade lots of good resturants and pubs close by hotel resturant ok but food preparation spotty good service though
