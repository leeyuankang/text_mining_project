clean room friendly staff and excellent location our visit was to attend a long awaited performance at the palace theatre shaftesbury avenue arriving in london early we were delighted to be able to check into our room and allow us to make the most of our short time in the city the beds were comfortable and we enjoyed the varied breakfast we would definitely recommend the hotel and would return the tube station being so near was also an added bonus
