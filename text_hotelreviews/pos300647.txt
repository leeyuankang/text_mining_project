staff was professional responsive to our demands we were three when we first arrived we needed a room for people first night and the following day the room would be left for one guest only although it took the staff sometime to allocate the room and so on i was impressed how the manger managed the situation noting that i reserved an executive room he allocated the room and he asked me professionally to pay for the extra bed also to check on guests per checking in the room was a nice complementary gesture
