perfect location and price on last minute was fantastic modern well lit reception a real bar with bar stools and draught beer good choice of drinks inexpensive cozy but contemporary spacious above all friendly unobtrusive and professional staff in fact the ease of my late check in and being able to chill was the bonus rooms excellent bigger than most other more renowned hotels i add the caveat that i got the room on a late deal but nevertheless it was a great hotel and i just love the location near enough the buzz if i want far away enough if i don t want a great stay
