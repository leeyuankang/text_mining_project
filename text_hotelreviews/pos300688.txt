the bed was surprisingly comfortable i like a firm bed and this seemed soft to sit on but was actually quite firm and supportive i slept really well the location is incredible right next to loads of nice restaurants in the brunswick centre a boots the chemist opposite a really great traditional yet modern pub and near very pretty russell square the room was a good size for london everything was clean good storage
