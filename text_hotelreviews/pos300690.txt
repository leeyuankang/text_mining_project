no frills modern clean hotel had a room on a high floor facing the back of the hotel which made the room very quiet which was nice room quite small but ok bathroom is fine double bed could have had a better quality mattress windows don t open alas unless you pay quid more and upgrade to a room on the top floor i didn t have breakfast so can t comment great location staff very friendly good value for money given the prime location
