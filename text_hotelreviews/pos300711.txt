great location you can walk from kings cross if you want to but russel square tube is a away opposite a small shopping centre with variety of dining options if you do not want to use the hotel which also offers a cafe bar plus a pub along with a restaurant basic room is compact but clean comfortable and quiet anyway why stay in your room if you are in london
