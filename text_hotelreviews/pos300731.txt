beautiful new hotel great lobby and rooms very clean and bright delicious breakfast was included with my room only downside there doesn t seem to be anything walking distance as far as food entertainment etc and no fridge in my room making eating anywhere but the hotel restaurant a bit difficult but to the hotel restaurant is delicious
