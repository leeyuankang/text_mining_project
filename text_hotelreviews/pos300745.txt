the staff were very friendly and helpful the bed and bedding was comfortable the location was good as very near a tube but it s not in the nice bit of bloomsbury the breakfast choice was not overly extensive but plentiful and tea and coffee was offered frequently by smiling staff breakfast was also calm and not a horrible canteen like bustle which was a nice change to many hotels
