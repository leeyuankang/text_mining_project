the hotel is conveniently located right opposite russell square tube station and next to brunswick square there is a large waitrose and lots of restaurants and coffee shops in the nearby area the room was very clean but only has single beds not ideal for adults and a young kid there is no room for adding an additional bed probably the hotel is more for business travel or for adults only
