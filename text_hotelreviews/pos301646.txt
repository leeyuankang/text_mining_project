the hotel was spotlessly clean but we never saw any staff cleaning or making up rooms the reception staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel design was modern to the extreme but we liked it although it is outside the main tourist areas we walked to those in minutes longer distances we took taxis twice and they were cheaper than we had been led to believe there are some very good restaurants with close walking distance but not for breakfast
