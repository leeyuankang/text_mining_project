the hotel is very well located easy to walk to from diagonal metro station and has lots of great restaurants in walking distance but doesn t feel like an unsafe or too busy area modern boutique hotel with mirrors everywhere as expected from the name with a comfortable bed we also appreciated the seating area in the room
