the hotel is at walking distance from most famous places and we took the metro twice in days just because we were feeling lazy many excellent vegan restaurants caf s and organic shops around there is a card activated door separating the lift from the rooms on each side so it s very quiet since there aren t random people talking in front of your room beautiful minimalist decoration very friendly and proactive staff i will very likely stay at the same hotel if i visit barcelona again
