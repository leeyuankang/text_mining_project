i forgot some of my clothing items behind and i contact the hotel management to send them to me unfortunately some of them went missing especially the most expensive ones i reported the matter to the hotel and requested to speak with the hotel manager but my request was not granted it is so disappointing that some of my items were stolen under the care of the hotel but more frustrating that nothing was done about it and the manager never contacted me though most of the staff i interacted with were really nice but the action of the hotel management about my missing items was appalling
