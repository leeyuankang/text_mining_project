trendy boutique hotel in a nice area of eixample close to avenida diagonal and to many good restaurants and caf s in the adjoining streets large well appointed room with a very comfortable king size bed and a roomy walk in shower with hydro massage functions not to mention all those huge mirrors everywhere you look there is a small pool on the rooftop wi fi works very well and there is a flat screen tv even in the toilet for those lonely moments when one might get a bit bored a word of praise for the friendly helpful and very professional staff from the good humoured people manning the hour reception to the discreet efficient and non intrusive cleaning staff
