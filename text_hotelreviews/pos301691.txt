we had an excellent night stay staff were very attentive and room very clean the robe and slippers were a nice touch additional security door which requires key card entry to get to your room made you feel safe and noise was rarely an issue we could not fault the breakfast everything was delicious and replenished instantly by the staff the breakfast is expensive unless you opt to add it when booking which i would highly recommend diagonal metro station is within easy walking distance as well as many lovely tapas restaurants on streets parallel to passeig de gracia overall an excellent choice
