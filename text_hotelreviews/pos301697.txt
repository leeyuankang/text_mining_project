the mirror was central to all attractions shops etc the staff were friendly and very helpful in booking excursions giving directions etc the beds are really comfy best i ve ever slept on whilst on holiday if you like a shower rather than a bath remember to ask on booking as my room had bath with a shower attachment where as our friends room had a walk in shower that was more like a jet wash but what i would have preferred had i been given the option although having said that after pounding the pavements of barcelona a hot foamy bath was very relaxing breakfast i felt was overpriced and was mainly continental hence we booked bed only and went next door during our stay to a lovely restaurant where they fell over backwards to get as close to a full english as possible overall an enjoyable trip and i wouldn t hesitate to return to the mirror when i return to barcelona
