wonderful stay on our first visit to milan we caught the train from the airport to centrale and then walked the kilometre or so to the hotel wonderfully warm greeting at the front desk and early entry to our room we booked an executive room on the floor reasonably large with a great bathroom and bath we were delighted on check in to discover that we were eligible for a half hour free massage in the spa and they were lovely breakfast was simple and included in the rate as was our room s minibar but very nice and wholly sufficient we re good walkers and did the duomo castle and the fashion district over the course of an afternoon if we ever go back to milan we ll definitely be staying here
