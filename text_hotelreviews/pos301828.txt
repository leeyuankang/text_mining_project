a fantastic hotel that has a very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere the complimentry mini bar was certainly a bonus and returning to our comfortable room to find a couple of choc easter eggs was a pleasent surprise the breakfast room is not the largest but once you are up relatively early its not a problem nice food too
