breakfast was ok freshly squeezed orange juice and good capuccino very limited choice of fruit and bread location is very good with the metro porta di venezia just a few meters away very practical if you need to catch the tube to the cadorna station or the duomo for instance but the duomo is only a min walk away the good location of the hotel allowed us to go everywhere on foot right opposite the hotel there is a vinoteca worth going to very nice food and good wine we went to mamma rosa about min walk and loved it great service and great food euros for people including main dishes oysters sparkling wine on arrival great bread slection water and coffee many places to eat around the hotel and nice shops too i will stay here again good value for money
