the hotel staff during the day was super nice and friendly don t know the name of the nice man in the reception but he was super competent super polite warm and welcoming recommended a nice local coffee shop an easy way to malpensa airport without the stress from the central station and overall he was good to catch our interests on our very short stay in milano without recommending too turistic places he really made our stay pleasant breakfast was good and staff was great and super service minded too the lady with the classes was so nice discrete and welcoming too everything in the minibar was free wifi was free hours stabile and easy to connection to rooms were made twice a day which was surprising but nice too felt so spoiled the spa was very nice would wish it opened at though and closed at though so we could had started the day in the spa before the breakfast or finished the day in the spa after some hours with aperitivo loved our romantic stay our view overlooking the shopping street would stay here again for sure
