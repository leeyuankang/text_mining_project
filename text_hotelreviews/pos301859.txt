i stayed in this hotel two years ago and i just loved it everytime i flew to milan this was on my top list but most of the time fully booked this time i was lucky to find a room staff are very friendly and helpful what i like the most is their fresh breakfast and late check out at pm location is just great for shopping i will always come back
