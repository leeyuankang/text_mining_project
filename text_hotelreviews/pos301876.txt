perfect location easy to go around city min walking from duomo many shops around subway access just around the corner bus to the airport in walking distance from the hotel friendly staff i was greeted with a rose which was a nice surprise free minibar with water beer juice cola free spa zone which we unfortunately didn t manage to visit good breakfast and overall we had a pleasant stay for the money we paid
