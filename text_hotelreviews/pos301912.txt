the hotel has a great location in front of an underground station which is four stations away from the city centre there are lots of restaurants and shops near it you can also walk to the train station but it s quite far so it s better to take the underground the staff is very friendly and they even give you a flower when you check in and fresh water at check out breakfast was spectacular diverse and tasty
