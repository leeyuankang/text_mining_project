everything was really great especially good customer service they presented my wife with a rose when we arrived it was our anniversary and the reception staff spend ages explaining the top sites in milan it was our first visit and generally they couldn t do enough lovely clean well decorated hotel spa was open even though they warned us at booking that it might be closed for renovation breakfast was amazing so much of everything for what we paid an absolute bargain can t recommend this hotel highly enough
