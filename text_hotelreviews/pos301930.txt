it was an excellent stay and i have nothing bad to say about this hotel it has a great location and proximity to porta venezia metro station is a huge plus my room was very comfortable bathroom was in a good standard the renovation work hasn t disturbed me much breakfast is good there is a choice for everyone s taste i believe wifi is strong and worked perfectly on all of my devices but the best thing about this hotel is the staff everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming very nice staff at the reception they were ready to help before i even looked at them they had a great knowledge of the city and its attractions always greeted me back with a smile and a nice word also the staff supervising the breakfast was very professional the lady who was there everyday made sure all worked perfectly every staff member whom i have encountered from the reception to the maids was smiled polite and friendly i think this is how the good places are becoming the great places
