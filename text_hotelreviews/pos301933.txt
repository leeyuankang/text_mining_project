room was larger than i expected i booked a single room staff were lovely and very helpful well stocked bathroom with a great shower terrific selection at breakfast very comfortable bed fantastic spa relaxation facilities including turkish bath sauna low light spa pool and relaxation area with snacks herbal teas and fruit i really liked the location of the hotel equidistant between the station and the duomo so away from crazy tourist crush but close enough to walk metro station just next to hotel so very convenient
