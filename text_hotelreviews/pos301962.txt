my usual hotel was booked out so this was the option i found good location right above porta venezia metro station which is an easy connection to the parking at cascina gobba don t bother driving into town it will just stress you finding a park the room i was given was refurbished and in good contemporary taste small but it was an overnight stay and perfectly comfortable and well designed equipped for those who need it there are tea and coffee making facilities i was well aware that you get what you pay for and it was a very good deal for the night so i m starting from low expectations
