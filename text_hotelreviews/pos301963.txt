the hotel was super clean and while we were worried about the comments that there was construction noise frankly we did not witness any the location is excellent with metro stop meters away from the hotel door the staff is very professional and courteous breakfast is very good and we enjoyed it everyday we have travelled to a number of locations in the last years and stayed at numerous hotels both for work and leisure but this has been one of our finest experiences
