great location just minute from metro and few stops from duomo located on busy shopping street very friendly and helpful staff hotel s interior looks lovely and quite romantic was pleasantly surprised with tea facilities in room as i arrived late it was just exactly what i needed upon arrival received a rose from a receptionist mood went up immediately spa is a great advantage check in advance opening hours breakfast is simple but all you need is there and waiters are very fast helping to refill coffee and arrange tables recommend this place for nigh stays as hotel going through renovation might be a bit noisy during the day
