i enjoyed an absolutely fabulous stay here every single staff member that i encountered be it at the front desk the breakfast area or the night doorman was super friendly small things such as the rose that you receive at check in and which bloomed more beautifullly every day of my week long stay and not being able to pass the reception desk without being acknowledged and greeted make you feel truly appreciated as a guest i stayed in a small double room but i didn t feel trapped in a back closet which the added small made me fear on the contrary the room was very comfortable with sufficient space a good bed and a stylish bathroom i ll definitely come back to this hotel if i ever visit milan again
