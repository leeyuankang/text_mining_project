the hotel was in a good location and was very clean and the staff very helpful i was asked for a euro deposit for mini bar which annoyed me so i told staff empty mini bar and i didn t pay the euro this was a down side and also the breakfast buffet was not what i d expect from a hotel of this standard not enough variety and food was cold but overall the hotel is very nice and we enjoyed our stay
