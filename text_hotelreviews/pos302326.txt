the hotel is a bit old and definitly not a star i would rate it an average star breakfast is good location is mins walk from milano central station just outside the door you will find the metro lima the area is good for shopping clothes cosmetics shops are open from till monday to saturday but not for restaurants you can find plenty of bad food turkish and arabs little restaurants in the area that beleive me their food is disgusting in milan go for an italian restaurants prices are nt expensive for a pizza or for pasta and food is lovely since metro is outside the door that wont be a problem to eat at the navigli porta genova area that is full of great restaurants my verdict is that this is a fair hotel which i found not expensive with a good service
