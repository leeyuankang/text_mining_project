firstly the check in process was extremely efficient and pleasant we stayed in the executive room on the floor so the bed bath and the room is extremely comfy with everything we expect from a star hotel in paris centre the staff are always friendly and smiling so that adds to the good service the location is fantastic with plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance my family found the christmas light up decor along rue haussmann and outside galeries lafayette and printemps to be the best anywhere we have seen so far including singapore
