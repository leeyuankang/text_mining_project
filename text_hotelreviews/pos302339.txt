excelent location on a central street and close to two central metro stations comfortable room and facilities very good breakfast however what i should stress the most was the staff they were very very helpful in helping me find my cellphone i had lost in an unknown taxi making all the contacts and warning me that they had found it even after i had already checked out of the property would definitely come back
