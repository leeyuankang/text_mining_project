the hotel was centrally located walking distance to doumo square famous shopping streets and buildings we didnt need metro bus or taxi central train station was within walking distance and it made easier get to the airport the staff were very helpful friendly and kind we have not experienced any negativity or problem the breakfast was fresh and attentive wifi was really nice i recommend this hotel location was perfect and safe
