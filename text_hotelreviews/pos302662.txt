huge room high ceilings overlooking the courtyard in a beautiful older building the bathroom was nice luxurious with a comfortable bath and shower staff was extremely friendly and always helpful in a great area away from all the tourist traps but surrounded by lots of restuarants cafes and shops about an minute walk from the metro with a tram stations just out front complimentary water bottles everyday chocolates and chips highly recommend and definitely worth a visit
