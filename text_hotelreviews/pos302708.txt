the villa itself was stunning and attention to detail incredible everything from landscaping to living room and kitchen well kept all rooms were beautiful and the master bedroom something else we even loved the smell of the shampoo and body soap loved that the car rental was included but mostly dimitri the host was very friendly and provided the best service anything we needed he did the utmost to make it happen and provided nice dining recommendations he picked up both of our parties one at the airport and one at the boat port and dropped us off at another port mins away at the end of our stay refusing to accept a tip sisi the cleaning lady servant was also fantastic doing an exceptional job with my laundry and serving breakfast every morning there was of us in total and the vote was unanimous we would all stay here again will definitely recommend to people staying in zakynthos
