all staff are super helpful and friendly including the trainees they checked all the train time table for me to lake como and we had a wonderful time and very pleasant day trip well done it s a very beautiful hotel in a heritage building the bar the room decoration are all very nice like a fairy tale mins walk to duomo the city center area which i prefer to stay a bit away from the tourists crowd so the location is ideal there is a supermarket around the corner open till which is very handy highly recommend a steakhouse near by call muu mins walk from the hotel it s excellent
