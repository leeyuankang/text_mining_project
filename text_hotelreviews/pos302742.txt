an amazing ethereal experience of a artsy boutique hotel we were blown away by the attention to detail from entering the hotel we were wowed by the decor only to be even more exhilarated to find personalised touches in our room for our honeymoon including a welcome note and cheese platter the location for central milan was brilliant as there were countless top rated restaurants all in walking distance breakfast itself was an experience with the most varied and luxurious items available to eat including an impressive tray of honeycomb to compliment the fresh fruit all in an alice in wonderland theme surreal ps a lovely little touch from the hotel included a beautiful goodie box which was left in our car on departure which contained treats to make our journey home smoother
