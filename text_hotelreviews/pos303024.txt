i have now stayed here twice liked it the first time so returned for a second trip the location was excellent close to metro and a short walk to duomo but away from the busy tourist restaurants my daughter is working in milan for a year and it is close to her home we discovered a few places to eat close to the hotel frequented by locals beds very comfy on my second visit i brought my mother and mother in law aged and and they were very happy we had a spacious room with three single beds breakfast was good desk staff helpful and friendly
