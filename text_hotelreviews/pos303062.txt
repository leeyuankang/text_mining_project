the location is excellent a minutes walk to the city center we had to spend one day in milano so we opted for an accommodation close to the cathedral the funniest thing happened because we booked and paid for a regular room at this hotel for one night and we got an apartment on floor with a conference room a bedroom and a huge bathroom the view at night was not bad at all
