the hotel staff accommodated us to do an early check in the room was spacious and clean with a safe to keep valuables was a good addition it seemed the room was newly renovated and the decor was good there is also an elevator to get to the rooms the breakfast is ok for an additional fee the location was ok it was a bit of a walk to get to the duomo
