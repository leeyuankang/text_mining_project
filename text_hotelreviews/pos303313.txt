everything you want elevator comfortable bed lots and lots of tv choice though smallish flat screen and space in the room great location pleasant ten minute walk to piazza duomo or one minute walk to metro and everywhere all for a reasonable not at all stiff price oh yes i see booking asks about the view from the room mine overlooked the major thoroughfare via porta romana which is why romana is in the title of the hotel and i found it a joy to open the window and look out on the bustle of a great city in the morning and it was not noisy at night
