there wasn t anything at all that we didn t like about the kensington hotel from the location to the service to the accommodation it was perfect it was like staying in a private home with the attention from staff who were attentive friendly but not stuffy or pretentious could not have asked for a more pleasant and comfortable room and bathroom which accommodated everything we could possibly want we have stayed at hotels around the world and the kensington is by far the best of all it s an absolute jewel
