location close to train stations and it also in walking distance to the duomo minute walk overall a nice hotel i saw the comments from people complaining about trivial things and they make no sense to me because when i travel it is for the purpose to go sightseeing and to experience the country not to spend an extended amount of time in a hotel room the only time i m in my hotel room is to sleep shower use the bathroom and have at a minimum a decent place to sleep it squeaks in at a star hotel but it is a star hotel nonetheless safe neighborhood and quiet hotel staff is nice and speaks english they have a multi plugin charger unit that has the ability to accept all international devices lastly i don t understand how you can complain about certain aspects of a hotel when you re provided with over pictures of interior and has a large number of comments from people that have previously stayed there you have more than enough evidence to make an informed decision some of these people sound foolish with their reviews comments
