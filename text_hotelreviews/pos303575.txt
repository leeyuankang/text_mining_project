lovely traditional typical old fashioned italian hotel with perfectly functioning facilities and fantastic efficient staff it was like stepping back in time to its heyday in the quality and comfort as expected by a hotel which was designed in this period i loved it and would stay there again with pleasure as i appreciated the authenticity but it is not for everyone and i think for a four star hotel it needs a refresh in terms of reception sofas and lighting stay away if you want modern
