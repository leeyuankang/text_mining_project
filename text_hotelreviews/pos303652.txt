the location of the hotel is ideal for anyone wanting easy access to historical sites museums shopping restaurants cafes multiple types of transit and walkable routes the buffet breakfast was extensive compared to many hotels and there were always at least very professional staff working there was a wide variety of food so even someone who has multiple dietary restrictions can easily fill up the coffee was fresh and served in individual pots all areas of the hotel were very clean including the room the room had the basic amenities including a cozy robe slippers various stationary tissues kleenex which many places no longer supply the bed and pillows were very firm which suited me fine but not my friend who found it too hard for a good sleep all of the staff who we interacted with were friendly helpful and showed genuine pride in their jobs they spoke various languages and were able to make many recommendations for best transit options where to eat getting a taxi and informing us of the transit closure due to a one day strike overall a great place to stay the staff s professionalism was unwavering and makes this hotel what it is
