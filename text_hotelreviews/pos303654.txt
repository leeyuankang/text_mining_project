location is good since it is in the heart of the primary tourist area of milan i e near the duomo also the metro is very close so moving around is easy room was clean and the housekeeping staff is good but cannot communicate as they spoke no english at all buffet breakfast is average and nothing to rave about restaurant staff is friendly
