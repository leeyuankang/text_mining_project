i always stay at this hotel when i need to overnight in milan on this occasion i stayed there the night of sunday june the location couldn t be better literally minutes walk to the duomo very friendly and helpful staff maurizio at the reception was particularly helpful my room was nice spacious spotlessly clean comfy bed the bathroom fixtures in perfect order with a good shower my only criticism would be the old style hair dryer the breakfast buffet is varied and plentiful and the waiter who was on duty was welcoming and efficient free wifi which worked well
