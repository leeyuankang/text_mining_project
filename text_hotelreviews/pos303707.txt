you cant beat the location of this hotel you walk out the back door and the galleria and duomo are literally right there nice area with lots of shops and restaurants its also a short walk to via della spiga we got a triple room and it was actually quite big with two separate rooms with two separate beds it was clean and relatively comfortable but it was definitely a little run down it could certainly use a little freshening up but we had a comfortable stay and the location kind of makes up for everything else wifi and air conditioning both worked well and the staff was friendly the breakfast area was also very nice and there was a good selection i probably would stay here again
