breakfast service was very slow but the food was good aside from breakfast the staff was wonderful greeted us by name every day and made us feel at home vito wrong spelling the butler was outstanding and fun to chat with a server dean was also fabulous they both made our stay feel extra special we will definitely go back to the kensington
