parking is at the hotel and is really cool self parking type garage the hotel is very modern chique on the inside and the rooms are very spacious the hotel is situated about min walk from the heart of milan were all the tourists attractions are the mattress was harder than we would have preferred but this is a preference and we would still recommend this hotel
