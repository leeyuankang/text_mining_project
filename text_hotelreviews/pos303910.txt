amazing location right by the historic center minute walk to sforza castle and minute walk to piazza del duomo galleria vittorio emanuelle lots of small bars osterias restaurants and trattorias around the hotel with great wine shops as well i recommend the meat shop meters away from the hotel personally there s also a nice le creuset store meters south everything is basically located within walking range staff at check in was very polite and spoke perfect english ladies responsible for breakfest and dinner were amazingly sweet to my children and really perfect overall breakfest was tasty with all sorts of coffee drinks made to order one of the best latte machiato i ever had really i only wish they had prosciutto crudo alongside coto but it was very good nonetheless room was spacious very clean and silent despite brera being a notorious bohemian neighborhood very strong shower heads were awesome as well i recommend this hotel to anyone considering escaping from the historic centre because of its notorious high prices even though the carlyle brera was not cheap it was better priced than the alternative and like i said it is located right outside the dreadful ztl but still within walking distance from the duomo anyway if you mistakingly drive through the ztl to get to the hotel they still offer you a form that is sent to the police so you won t get ticketed thank you carlyle brera staff
