we love staying at the kensington hotel and have stayed often the welcome is warm from the moment you walk up the steps and into reception until you leave particularly from the staff who greet you and help with luggage and the receptionists the lounge space has been beautifully decorated and the cocktail bar looks great since the refurbishment last year
