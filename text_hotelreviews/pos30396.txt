small room but beautifully maintained really comfortable bed and luxurious bedding the lounge restaurant areas of the hotel are delightful like living in a more gentile time the staff are exceptional their customer service skills are awesome and made me feel very welcome the hotel is only minutes walk from the south kensington underground station and there are many restaurants nearby
