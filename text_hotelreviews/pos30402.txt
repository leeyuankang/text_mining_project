in order to attend a daylong course in london i needed to stay in town for a couple of nights by basing ourselves at the kensington not only could i walk to ucl which is just round the corner but the proximity to the tube meant we were only a couple of stops from the westend for the couple of shows we crammed in and the heathrow express to return home after a super time the kensington is relaxed characterful and elegant and the staff are both friendly and proficient we would happily return just need a good excuse
