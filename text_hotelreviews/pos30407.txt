this hotel is a perfect place to land in london we lived in london for a long time and still have a rented flat in the south ken area this hotel offered us a perfect place to host old friends for tea or a cocktail and then progress for dinner the grand and well appointed lounges are perfect for quiet conversations but remain bright and airy the service is impeccable
