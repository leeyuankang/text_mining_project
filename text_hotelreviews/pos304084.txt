very helpful staff especially when i needed to book the last supper ticket and when i lost my pair of glasses at rinascente they were very attentive in following up with the lost property dept of the store on the day of our departure we needed to get a taxi to the airport the hotel offered us their private vehicle at the same standard price as the taxis as we were informed which is very nice
