great location within walking distance to all milan has to offer shopping cafes restaurants and the duomo all within an easy flat walk our room was very spacious and comfortable the size of a studio apartment the roof top bar at the hotel is worth enjoying for sunset drinks as you have an excellent view of the duomo lighting up as night falls our photos of this and the city skyline were magnificent recommend
