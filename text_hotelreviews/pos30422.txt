we enjoyed the personal friendly touches made by all members of staff very welcoming and relaxing a real treat i was spoilt as it was my birthday and received a complementary bottle of bubbly from the hotel when they found out excellent breakfast clean tidy room comfy bed and excellent shower room on the small side but we were fine with that it was quiet at night and not too much traffic noise minutes walk from south kensington underground we will most definitely return and stay again
