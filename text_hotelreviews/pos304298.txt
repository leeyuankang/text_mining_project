the staff was rude the receptionists were giving different facts about parking and in the end we were charged eur car breakfast is horrible eur and you have to order decent coffe because the americano that is served for breakfast tastes like bad water just walk to a caffeteria nearby and spare youre nerves the only thing ok about the hotel is the proximity to duomo i do not recomnend the hotel to anyone you can probably find a place that correspondes to quality and price ratio
