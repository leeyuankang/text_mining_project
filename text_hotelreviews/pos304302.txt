our room was on the small side but had a balcony overlooking the street bed comfortable and room clean reception staff at first were unfriendly but after the first day were very helpful even recommending an excellent restaurant for sunday evening when many places were closed and arranging taxis for us tram stop outside the hotel to connect with metro was great although no stop nearby on the way back obviously not the hotel s fault hotel s taxi to bergamo for our return flight was excellent
