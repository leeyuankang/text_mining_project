the room was big with a nice bed and in relative good shape although we did not like the carpet on the floor we particularly liked the big bathroom that was freshly renovated although the room was facing the road on the first floor the tram or the traffic did not annoy us room was spoteless something we appreciated the breakfast had a good variety of choices although nothing impressive but they do prepare fresh espresso capuccino if you like staff was good and helpful
