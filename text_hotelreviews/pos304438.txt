everything was excellent after our accomodation with a similar price in a tiny room in paris this hotel was like a palace for us room was so big and comfortable with a wide bathroom its wide windows were helpful for me because i have asthma even if they accidentally doublecharged before our trip they immediately got in touch with us to get our required informations so they could refund and they refunded that day as said stuff replied our questions in less than half an hour each time breakfast was included and we loved everything they served except tomato olives cucumber they had everytthing there is a tram stop in front of the hotel so you can go to the center around duomo cathedral by one vehicle there is a very big market min away from the hotel you can find anything you want there there is also the best icecream shop in milan next to the supermarket because of the socket i couldn t plug my hairdryer and had to use the one in the bathroom which took a lot of time then i asked for an extra plug so i could plug mine and the problem was solved they were helpful about everything everything was great with this hotel we really enjoyed our stay there
