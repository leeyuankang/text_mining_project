at first the proximity of the hotel to the train lines looked like it might be noisy but proved to be a bonus double glazing helped with the noise factor and transport around the city was made much easier the hotel was very comfortable with good sized bedroom a usable balcony and clean bathroom with good quality toiletries breakfast was a fabulous smorgasbord with a large variety of foods for differing tastes the hotel restaurant had good food and excellent service staff were helpful with directions and advice for tourist opportunities the local area had a supermarket nearby and good cafes bars and restaurants
