our stay at nasco hotel was perfect although the hotel is a little bit outside the city center there is a metro station and train station called milano nord domodossola just a few hundred meters from the hotel right behind the coop supermarket and this made it very easily for us to move around the city and to como lake there is also a tram station in front of the hotel and you can take tram no to get to the center tickets can be bought at the reception the staff was also amazing and they made our stay really enjoyable we could benefit from our early check in as they had a room ready for us as we requested they also gave us a room on a higher floor with a balcony so we could rest after our long walks in the city breakfast is great with lots of selections from fruits to pastries eggs meat etc but the thing that made our stay perfect was the cleanliness of the rooms they were literally sparkling we would come back any time to this hotel
