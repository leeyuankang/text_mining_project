just a tip when using metro line exit on domodossola station and go on foot approx minutes or take any for stops this is far more convenient then exiting on the gerusalemmo metro station also a minutes ride with tram or from cadorna possible spa is nice but always check how many people are inside we were lucky to be alone but hotel permits up to visitors this is too much to my opinion this spa accommodates or people maximum hotel offers really delicious breakfast and good dinner rich alcohol selection in the bar almost every evening there were some sweeties or sparkling wine offered in the lobby together with quite large library full of taschen books comfortable reading zone and possibility to print your selfies for free it makes reasonable to spend one evening just in the hotel lobby if you visit spa hotel gives you extra slippers and bathrobe included in the price you can get public transport ticket from the reception just pay in cash atm is m away in the next building
