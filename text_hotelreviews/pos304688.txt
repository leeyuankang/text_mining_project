decor is really different from other hotels so very refreshing and fun service was excellent our room was a little too hot and we couldn t work the controller but were silly enough not to ask shame on us not them as they could have adjusted centrally the window did open though while a little out of centre the area is lovely and surrounding shops not geared for tourists so better value also the tram from outside the door takes you straight to town would definitely stay and recommend
