i stayed in the enterprise hotel with my sister we were in milan to attend the opera at la scala the hotel is in an excellent location a residential area minutes on the tram from the city centre the trams are a very iconic part of the transport system in milan and the journeys are so enjoyable the hotel has every facility and the reception staff are quite outstanding in their level of attention and they also provide informative and accurate information an added bonus is being able to buy your tram ticket at the hotel the hotel also has a very efficient taxi booking service the room was very comfortable bathroom an ample size and tea coffee making facilities are in the room i requested an iron and it was brought to the room complete with ironing board in less than minutes very impressive it was wonderful to be able to stay in a hotel in milan that was in a very quiet area but also within such easy reach of the city centre i can recommend the enterprise hotel to all travellers and i would stay there if i visit milan again
