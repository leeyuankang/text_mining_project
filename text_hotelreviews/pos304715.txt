super extra helpful staff you get star service paying for a star hotel they welcome you with a glass of prosecco and nibbles as well as water but apparently you can help yourself anytime you like the reception is really a very modern concept and it is in fact open they even sell metro tram bus tickets it is the one for all actually and they loan out portable wifi hotspots for free we stayed in a superior double and every aspect of it was great our rooms were cleaned and tidied up every day and our complimentary bottle of water was always replaced the breakfast can feel expensive at euros but it is really worth it really good quality ingredients very beautiful smoking area in the internal garden protected by the elements they also organise beautiful aperitivo nights on thursdays also you should try the nice aperitivo places in corso sempione close to the arch i tried disaronno and it was really good do not try the kebab shops round the corner there is a good size supermarket within minutes walking distance a tip there is a bus service minute walking from the hotel that goes directly to malpensa airport and i think that there is a drop off point on the way from malpensa this is very convenient as you avoid the city centre traffic and it is much closer than other regions
