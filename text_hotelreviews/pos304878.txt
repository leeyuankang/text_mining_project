the hotel was not too far from the airport we took a taxi as we did not want to get lost the taxi from the airport only cost which we thought was quite good the hotel was as you saw in the pictures the room was clean and quite and a reasonable size the bathroom was also clean and a good size the room had a cleaning policy so if you wanted your sheets towels changed everyday they would as you to leave your towels on the bed however if you did not then you would leave them hanging the bed was very big and comfy as it was quite warm when we went we would leave the ac on in the room which meant leaving a key in the room to leave the electricity on the hotel was in a good area which was close to the beech and to a shopping centre however this hotel was not close to central and despite not taking long to get into the centre if you don t like public transport or spending your money on taxis i would recommend staying closer we did not have an issue with using both taxis and public transport to get in and out of our hotel to the centre the ticket for the train was cheap and it was nice to explore the outskirts the staff were helpful
