friendly and polite staff whilst checking in we were given a map of the city information on local attractions sites as well as a list of restaurants to eat in which i really liked the breakfast was extremely good with a wide variety of foods to choose from staff were constantly ensuring that food was available and that there wasn t times when certain things were not available great hotel i did look at hotels that were closer to the city or ones that had a metro stop opposite but the walk to this hotel was worth it with the shops and mall near by also the beach is with in a walking distance would recommend definitely stay here again
