the staff were extremely friendly at any time of the day or night they knew very good english the facilities were really clean beat my expectations for a star hotel the hotel has a small gym downstairs and a sauna steam room but i didn t use those nice pool on the top of the hotel and has some great degree views of barcelona where you can also enjoy a drink from the bar good value for money
