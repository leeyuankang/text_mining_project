the staff were extremely accommodating the breakfast was brilliant and very well priced our room was exactly the same as what the website had to offer which hasn t exactly been the case in the past with other hotels the metro station was only a walk away very close to a shopping mall and a dozen restaurants within the mall i would definitely recommend this hotel
