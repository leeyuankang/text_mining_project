this hotel is really perfect i was specially looking for not so expensive place with good rating the fact that it s not in the center of barcelona is actually it s advantage it s really quite the supermarket with not for tourist prices is reachable in mins subway in there is a lot of space to park a car around the hotel for free the view from rooftop is simply breathtaking especially in the evening rooms very perfectly clean personnel was really helpful and friendly and it was really quiet usually in spain a lot of hotels are made in a way you hear every room on your floor even in the night but here it was so quiet and comfortable we just loved it we will definitely choose tryp by wyndham again
