the staff were really friendly and very helpful they saved us buying a day pass for the hop on hop off bus service they were right it could be done within a day the rooms were large clean and comfortable the location was ideal for us away from the noise and bustle of the more central areas and easily accessible by walking taking the metro or the bus
