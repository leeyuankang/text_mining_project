i have spent a weekend at the hotel and had a great time their staff is very friendly and the room was really nice and quiet the neighborhood is quiet and not full of tourists the drinks at the bar are very good i highly recommend their mojito if you want to do some shopping you can go to the mall illa diagonal which is on the other side when you cross the park
