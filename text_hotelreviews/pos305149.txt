everything was amazing all the staff were so kind and after mentioning that me and my partner were celebrating our year anniversary the hotel was nice enough to give us an upgrade on our room and decorated it with balloons and offered macaroons the bed was huge and was so comfortable the bathroom was amazing with a great shower the room was simple and modern the location was probably the best part because it was right in the centre there was a min walk max to anywhere in amsterdam pretty much and the restaurants around the hotel were great although i would say the cafes by the canals are also worth a try overall an amazing experience thank you so much nh
