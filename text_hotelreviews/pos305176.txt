the hotel was ideally placed for everything around amsterdam the staff were so relaxed and friendly we stayed in the tailors bar one evening and the two barmen james and erwan kept us supplied with a variety of cocktails and entertainment we really would recommend letting them choose the cocktails as their knowledge is wider than the already extensive cocktail list
