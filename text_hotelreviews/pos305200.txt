the offset building to the hotel was quite noisy at during the night due to the people partying in the narrow alley technical personell working on the room nextdoor were not doing anything to be quite draging chairs over the floors talking loud on the phone just outside my door very early in the morning etc the room was excellent but they offered us a new room the night after inside the hotel and yes it was both quite and nice it was the breakfastpersonell that raised the question if they could do anything to improve our stay obviously the tech personell had reported to management that i had told them off with the phone episode that itself is very professional if you do something wrong and report yourself thats respect to them good job no hard feelings the best part was the amazing breakfast you need to experience it don t think anymore just book this hotel if it is within your budget
