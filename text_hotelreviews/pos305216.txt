the staff were very friendly we got a free upgrade because it was our anniversary and rose petals on the bed and little cakes in the evening the hotel itself is clean and modern and the breakfast room looked amazing although we didn t use it it s a great location right in the heart of the city it can be a little noisy at night but that comes with being so central
