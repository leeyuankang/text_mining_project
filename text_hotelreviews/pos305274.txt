the breakfast was standard international buffet and the croissants were crispy staff were very helpful and coped well with a broad range of international travellers we arrived later at night than expected due to delays in transport staff were not only highly professional and went the extra mile to make sure we were provided with room service karel in reception is to be recommended for his service similarly the concierge were helpful there is an excellent coffee shop i have known this hotel since and i would suggest that it is at its best in all that time
