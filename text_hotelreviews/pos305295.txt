the staff were brilliant very helpful didn t even look in the restaurant or bar as it was very expensive but a lovely hotel we were a bit scared as one of the lights were dodgy and a clip on the shower fell down and we thought maybe they would think it was us but we didn t destroy the place ha overall a great place and if we had more money i m sure we would ve loved the restaurant and bar
