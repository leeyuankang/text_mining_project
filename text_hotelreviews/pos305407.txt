the location was the only reason we chose the hotel and for the price we paid the room is without a view and very small for two persons the air conditioning is set and we couldn t get the room warmer and it s freezing outside we stayed nights and the sheets were never changed complimentary bottled water was only available on the day we checked in no replacement the following days i can conclude there is nothing i like about it
