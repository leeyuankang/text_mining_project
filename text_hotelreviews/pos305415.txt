the room and location was amazing the staff were great as it was a surprise for my husbands birthday they upgraded our room to a premium room free of charge and when we entered there was balloons and pastry surprises from the chef and a little note wishing him a happy birthday our room was cleaned everyday and in the evening we would come back to our lights being on low mood and chocolates on the pillows little touches like this makes the trip more meaningful especially being in a different country
