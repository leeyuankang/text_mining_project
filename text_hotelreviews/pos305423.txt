the staff in this hotel are excellent they just can t do enough for you one of our party took ill while we were there they were so kind helpful the rooms are great with lovely comfy beds the barmen in the tailor bar are also worth a mention lovely guys ok so it s not the cheapest hotel around but it s nice to treat oneself now again
