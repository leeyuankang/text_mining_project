excellent location you could walk to grand central station and the trams also a few good restaurants nearby we had not booked breakfast the hotel charged euros each but just to the right of the hotel was a lovely restaurant where we had breakfast for euros each this could easily be shared as too much for one person large baguette large croissant ham cheese jams and nutella
