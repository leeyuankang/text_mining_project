the staff were fantastic and we even checked in early on the day we arrived the room was utterly beautiful and it was the biggest bed i have ever seen the hotel is perfectly situated in the center of amsterdam and also they provided me with gluten free bread at breakfast there was so much food for both of us at breakfast and it tasted phenominal but also the hotel lent us an umbrella for all the days that the weather was a little questionable which was fantastic
