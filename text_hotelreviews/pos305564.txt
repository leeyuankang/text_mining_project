i booked this nh hotel collection because i like nh hotels and know its perfect as i had stayed here last year for days and this year i was traveling with two friends from colombia and i wanted them to experience amsterdam at its best the grand hotel krasnapolsky offers apartments that the entrance is in the canal zone behind the hotel it s perfect for those wanting to experience living and climbing those steep narrow stairs to wake up in the morning and see the canals and at night be able to sit on the stoop and see the beautiful people walk by is an absolute adventure this hotel is my favorite for amsterdam
