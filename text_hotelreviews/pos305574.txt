we had a fantastic stay hotel is very nicely located rooms are large size and very clean simple but nicely decorated their staff is very professional very kind very hospitable but the price is sky high too expensive we think as this location is ideal otherwise it is just an average star hotel but very hospitable and welcoming staff they have taken a very good care of us
