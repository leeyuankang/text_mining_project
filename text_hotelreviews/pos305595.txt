when we arrived the hotel did not have our booking com reservation no record of it don t know who was at fault but it generated some anxious moments for my wife and i however and to their credit the staff particularly beatrice at the front desk was extremely helpful in getting us a room even though it was early in the morning way before check in our room looked right out on dam square and was very nice it was a large sunny and well appointed room it provided a great start to our european vacation
