location is perfect on dam square you are just away from red light district and most attractions accessible by foot train station just minutes away and most of the trams and buses goes to dam square the stuff was superb they upgraded our room for free just because they had them empty but the thing that impressed me the most that there are tesla cars taxis in amsterdam iam a big fan of the brand and i tryed to catch one but failed this cars are very expensive and i never thought i ride one i came to the reception and asked if they can order tesla electric car for me and they did that was the best airport ride of my life thank you very much
