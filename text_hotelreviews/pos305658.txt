very efficient check in the reception personnel are very kind and helpful location cannot be better right in the heart of amsterdam yet the room is very quiet and we had a good sleep next to the hotel is a street with many good restaurants cafe bakery souvenirs cheese store you name it if this is your first time to amsterdam this is a good place to stay and explore the city
