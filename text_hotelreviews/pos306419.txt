the location was great however this area is very busy with people moving to and from central station bus lines trams canal traffic tour groups meet outside this iconic hotel so be prepared we were moved to a room in the urban wing which was very clean and comfortable with magestic view out to central station and the canals all the staff at the hotel were super friendly helpful and attentive overall we were extremely happy with our stay here
