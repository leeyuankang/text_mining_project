i liked park plaza victoria amsterdam and would recommend it for several reasons the location was excellent this applies to those of us who do not wish to spend too much time and effort navigating in search of the booked accommodation the hotel was located opposite the amsterdam central train station and all it required was a minute walk from the station to reach the hotel the options for shopping and dining was plentiful in and around the vicinity of the hotel and this offered unparalleled convenience in my interactions with the hotel service staff be it the front desk or the concierge they were consistently courteous helpful and professional in the way they carried out their duties we were also delighted when the hotel prepared a small but lovely surprise for my partner and i as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary in amsterdam they also paid attention to our requests on booking com and onsite and all of these made us felt very welcome the executive king room was spacious and the view was great the bed was comfortable and the hotel provided high quality bath robes and sandals
