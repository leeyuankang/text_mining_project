the good thing about this hotel was the location it was opposite the main central train station i asked about the parking nearby and i was given a postcode for a secure underground car park please note there is no free parking with the hotel they also have a small gym which does have a good facility s i e treadmills bikes and weights bench up to arms and shoulders also a small pool but this more for couples who want to left alone for privacy you can t do lengths due to it s size
