staff were very friendly and the concierge could not have more helpful on the first day telling us which tram we would need and giving us a city map room was set over two floors with stairs down the bed very nice very large room and comfortable bed location was perfect not too far for any attractions and opposite central station to pick up any trains trams and buses
