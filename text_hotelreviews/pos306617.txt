well placed hotel being only opposite from the railway station which offers a frequent and inexpensive service to the airport the room was exceptionally clean it was quiet allowing a good nights sleep the hotel staff were warm and friendly and all spoke english the breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot and cold dishes we had a really good meal in the brassiere in the hotel which was not only tasty but offered real valve for money be advised to make a reservation though
