i arrived at and the front desk staff were friendly welcoming and got me checked in very quickly i got the direct coach from stansted airport to stratford and it was a short walk over the bridge to the hotel the room was nicely decorated and comfortable a bit chilly but the temperature controls were easy to manage i was able to order room service from the limited menu the bed was really comfortable the room was quiet and it had a lovely bathroom with a decent shower there were a couple of dark grey streaks on one of the white bath towels that looked like mascara but apart from that it was spotless check out in the morning was quick and efficient and i was able to leave my case with the concierge on the ground floor for the day too it s in a great location within westfield a very short walk from stratford station and the olympic park
