had to ask and pay for an upgrade as the superior room was far from that and was small dark and tired we upgraded to an urban room which was modern light and airy however i begrudge paying for a bottle of water in the room especially when the room rate is high the bar was good didn t eat in the hotel so can t comment on the quality
