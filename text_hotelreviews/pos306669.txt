the location of the hotel is very central right opposite the main train station great for people like us who were only in amsterdam for hours and didn t want to spend ages travelling into the centre the room was lovely and clean and the bed was so comfy the staff were friendly and approachable they even added a little birthday balloon and some sweets chocolate for my boyfriend at the time of booking i said we were celebrating a birthday
