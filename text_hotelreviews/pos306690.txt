everything we liked that the hotel was close to central station because as we toured the town we could always find street signs guiding us back to central station and hence the park plaza victoria hotel the staff was truly wonderful genuinely helpful and always pleasant i thought the room was great what i need in order of priority is clean beds and a shower the spaciousness of our room was a big bonus i read reviews of this hotel before choosing it and numerous people made comments that the room decor was tired i don t need a newly decorated decor when i m on the road i put priority on that at home on the road it s cleanliness proximity of beds and a shower and this hotel was a star for me in those categories
