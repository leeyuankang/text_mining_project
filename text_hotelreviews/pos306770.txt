there is not much to like about this hotel we paid over aud per night for one of the worst rooms in one of the ugliest stinkiest hotels i have ever stayed in awful value for money and i m not sure how they ve managed stars i ve stayed in a lot of star hotels in my time and this is by far the worst looked more like a star to me the only good thing about this stay was the trainee receptionist who upgraded our room for a small fee because the first one was so hideous and on a floor that smelled like mould and mildew and had a tiny and dirty window that let in hardly any natural light we had her again on check out and she is just delightful but the guy who originally checked us in i think i even heard him say he was the duty manager was terrible i had confirmed to purchase and uograde of our room which hadn t come through on their end apparently and he made no attempt to fix this just said sorry you ll have to have a superior as booked superior these rooms are not you expect a lot more for per night per night in most cities gets exceptional quality not here not even close
