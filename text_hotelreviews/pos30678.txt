the best thing about this hotel was the capacity to book inter connecting rooms this is by far the best arrangement for a family and made us feel safe and secure we were able to specify a double plus a twin the bed was very comfortable and a choice of soft or firm pillow was a nice touch the room was comfortable clean and a good temperature everything we could have needed was provided including and iron and ironing board
