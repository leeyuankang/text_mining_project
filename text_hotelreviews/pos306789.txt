swimming pool and spa facilities were lovely although locals use it as their regular gym and didn t seem too happy we were there good location right opposite the train station but a distance from the museums we upgraded our room to the newer part of the hotel and it was worth every penny lovely and modern good mini bar clean staff were very helpful and information desk made it easy to book things to do with good advice and good discounts
