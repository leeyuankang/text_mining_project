staff were very nice we went as it was my partners birthday and our anniversary plus it was the time traveling with a infant and staff made us feel welcome and even decorated the room for us with balloons and towel swans sweets and mini bottle of red wine with no extra cost location was good if u wanted to stay near red light but far away from shopping districts and vondel park where we took our son a few times so i would think twice about staying if u like the other end
