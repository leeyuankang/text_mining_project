i was concerned to read some of the views expressed by other travellers around the difference between the original victoria hotel and the new urban wing the room we had was an executive in the original wing and was large comfortable and well equipped i accept that the d cor and design could be considered a little dated but as someone who has spent more than nights in hotels over the past fifteen years there was in my view very little to complain about the location of the hotel is ideal as it is just across the road from centraal station the tram and bus hub as well as being close to the harbours for both canal tours and ferry connections indeed public transport right across amsterdam is frequent and offers good value for money adjacent to the hotel are two of the main roads damrak nieuwezijds voorburgal leading to many shops and a restaurants one those recommended was het karbeel in warmeostraat offering a diverse menu good wine and great service had a blast only glitch was getting home and would definitely stay at the park plaza victoria hotel again
