the hotel location was superb the staff were extremely nice especially the manager peter he even allowed us to keep our luggages when we left for brussels it s so convenient even when we came back to amsterdam we stayed at airbnb he even called us the cab and gave us access to freshen up at the hotel s toilet before we took off for our airbnb apartment we were amazed at their hospitality we regret for not staying at park plaza victoria for the rest of our stay we should have i really recommend the place
