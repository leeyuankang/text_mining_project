fantastic right from the start from the check in even though we aren t club members we were treated very well the rooms were clean and neat we were lucky enough and they gave us an upgraded room which was great cleaning staff another great just one of the few hotels we stayed at in our month long trip through europe that lived up to and surpassed expectations we used to stay at the renaissance around the corner for years the couple of dollars you may spend extra here will be well worth the quiet rooms the laundry charges are a bit much but you can always walk down and do it at the laundry mat that they were happy to point out to us
