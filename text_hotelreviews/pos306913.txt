when i mentioned to reception later that the room we had did not have a city view and the room was rather basic and gloomy we were given a better room along with an upgrade to an executive room despite us only staying for one evening this means we will definitely stay here again rather than look elsewhere we did not have breakfast as we left early but the hotel had all facilities and was in a great location
