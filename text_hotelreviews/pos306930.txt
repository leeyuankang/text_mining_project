the location of the hotel was amazing and loved the fact that there was a balcony facing the station i also loved that fact that you had a fantastic choice of tv programmes in english and also the same plug sockets from england which helped us out as my friend forgot her adaptor the staff members that are there to help by the revolving doors are amazing always happy to help great personalities and made my stay extremely pleasurable i would defiantly come back to this hotel because of the men at the doors and the location
