i stayed here in december with a group of friends and we all agreed it was a great choice it is located at the central train station and is within easy walking distance of sights and nightlife the staff were very helpful for those unsure of directions or places of interest and had plenty of suggestions for food and entertainment without just trying to get us to only spend money in the hotel there seemed to be two staff members in the door for this the rooms were comfortable clean and well appointed as were the bathrooms with quality toiletries dinner was very good if a bit expensive all in all a great stay here would definitely return and also highly recommend to others
