a charming hotel in a fantastic location the staff were really friendly and with a great sense of humour very close to the main rail station canal tours and city centre sights plenty local bars cafes and restaurants sorry to only stay one night we were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which was very comfortable breakfast was good quality food if not dazzling presentation
