very good location for shopping trains and car parking car parking fees are reasonable for hour parking compared with other locations in london as a whole although on the edge of a very popular and busy shopping mall the room was very quiet perfect location for west ham football stadium and london aquatic centre which are just minutes walk away good breakfast choice will be returning again
