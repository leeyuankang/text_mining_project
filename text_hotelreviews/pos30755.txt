the staff were fantastic so friendly when i admired a picture of the olympic village hanging in reception i was given a post card of the picture to take home marco the concierge deserves a special mention as he was lovely and very kind to my daughter our room was quiet and we had a view of the london stadium which was a bonus as we re west ham fans
