so the hotel is really small and hidden but location is just perfect in front of tram stations close to it and at the fork where you can chose your destination i didn t try their food as their restaurant was closed for renovation rooms were very clean more than just clean i got the smallest room ever you can imagine single size bed but it was like a gift box clean and cozy space was not an issue for me as a solo traveler
