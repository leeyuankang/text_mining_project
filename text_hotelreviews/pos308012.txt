i ve never had the chance to go to the hotel because of the new years bombing in istanbul and i was almost going to cancel it but they were so welcoming and they told me i can visit the hotel whenever suits me they also said noone should go through what we are going through in istanbul i respect how much they see everyone as equal humen which is a lot more important than the comfort of the bed or the taste of the food or even the hygiene because it is the hygiene of a heart so i checked everything with a point of perfect because it is important to be a human at the end i ve never had the chance to visit the hotel because of another crisis in istanbul but oh well i will come and see you guys and thank you in person
