the staff were all friendly helpful and professional they also had great senses of humor and good advice re places to see nice restaurants etc the superb restaurant accessible from the lobby serves a fantastic breakfast buffet in addition to lunch and dinner be careful walking out of the front door you might get mowed down by the crowds coming from the train station just down the street the hotel is in the city centre due to its location you should expect sirens early morning revelers singing in the streets and lots of people from all over the world all day every day the hotel staff does a good job of keeping problems away from the hotel not that amsterdam is all that problematic
