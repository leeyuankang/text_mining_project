we were worried our room would be quite small but our room on the floor was huge and location was ideal all staff were extremely polite rooms made up each day fresh towels each day can not fault the service at all would even say it was more like service than made our holiday in amsterdam what it was and we will definitely return when we are next back hopefully get around to trying the restaurant in the hotel looked lovely value for money definitely worth the extra pennies to stay here they allowed us to keep our bags there while waiting a few hours before our flight to go home and when we arrived we were hours early for check in dropped in to leave our bags and our room happened to be ready so got straight in so that was a huge plus after being awake since that morning needed a snooze
