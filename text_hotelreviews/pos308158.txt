my wife and i recently paid another visit to amsterdam staying at the swissotel on the damrak right next to dam square the hotel has recently had some renovations especially the restaurant which to me is modern dutch and very nice we stayed in a select room which was also recently renovated and had a terrific bathroom with a rain shower which i loved and like the rest of the room was kept spotless the one downside was i found the room on the small side with hardly enough room for my wife and i to pass each other between the bed and the desk but we soon got into a routine speaking about the bed which was very huge and comfortable but boy was it high i recon about feet there was even a menu for your pillows also there was no need to close the curtains just press a button and it was done we were there for an anniversary break and the hotel gave us a curtesy bottle of bubbly which was very much appreciated i had to check in online for our return flights but for some reason i couldn t complete this but the concierge called albert managed to do this for us saving time at the airport another great service from the very helpful staff at this hotel the hotel is in the perfect location for exploring the city there are bars restaurants shops red light area all within walking distance and believe me it s the way to see the city not forgetting the canal boat trips i would recommend this hotel and will stay there again
