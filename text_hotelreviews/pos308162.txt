fantastic central location next to the royal palace dam square and min walk from the train station but handy for the tram to escape the crowds staff are very friendly and extremely helpful we were upgraded to a suite on arrival which was most welcome after a long day at work very comfy bed and extremely clean room with coffee machine and kettle would recommend and will definitely stay here again the next time we re in amsterdam
