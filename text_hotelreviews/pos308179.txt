the location is absolutely terrific we were told that we d been upgraded from a premium to a renovated room however it was an average room the mattress was very comfortable and we did sleep well our room was also quiet which is something i had requested the shower was terrific housekeeping was very good we were allowed an extra hour to check out and reception helped print out our return boarding passes
