the room was comfortable staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was excellent and good value they have increased the size of the breakfast area since my last visit a few years ago and it is no longer cramped it is a little pricey at weekends but so are all the other amsterdam hotels and the location of this one is excellent the rooms tend not to have good views but that makes them quiet which i prefer as this is a noisy are at night the gym was excellent and underutilised as was the business centre what more could i ask for
