i was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the room the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and all that for a comparably lower price especially considering the location i ve stayed in swissotel in zurich earlier this year where i d give the opposite rating for most of the questions above i only needed a temporary place to stay as i live in amsterdam for this reason i wanted something close to the office i work at willing to sacrifice the quality for location surprisingly i got one of the best quality rooms i ve stayed in while it was still dirt cheap check my rating history here i don t usually provide feedback only if it was very bad or exceptionally good
