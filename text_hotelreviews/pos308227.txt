staff was friendly the location is very central east to get to everything by taxi and if you are a good walker you can probably reach walking to everything within a half an hour using you phone gps if you have not booked the room including breakfast at reception they will offer you buffet breakfast for euros in a semi attached restaurant but you can go there order of the menu for a lot less and better
