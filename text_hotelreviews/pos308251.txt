the staff were excellent and welcoming beautiful room we had a disability room and it was excellent two different shower bench facilities quiet room good size the location is right at the heart of dam square but once inside peaceful small entry meant we had very few steps from front door to elevator and disabled room was close to elevator so great access lemon water and apples available all day and water bottles on request we also were provided welcome wine and munchies the new restaurant is modern not as elegant but a nice varied menu and excellent pizza
