i was lucky to find a room here after being stranded late at amsterdam airport for the night i was kindly given an upgrade to a marvellous room which i unfortunately could only enjoy for five hours before a very early rescheduled flight the next morning this small short luxury was a much needed relief from an otherwise terrible day of travel chaos should i return to amsterdam in the near future for more pleasant reasons i will definitely keep your hotel in mind thank you sincerely david jenkins associate professor of law university of copenhagen
