the room was very comfortable slightly on the small side but still very comfortable and clean staff was brilliant offered us complimentary fruit platter for our anniversary and were very lovely the way they approached us to offer this the extra pillows you can order is a very nice touch just make sure you order way in advance to get what your after we didnt end up having the breakfast but prices seemed reasonable the hotel had a lovely smell to the hallways and lifts
