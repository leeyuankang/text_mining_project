we had booked this hotel quite a long time ago so had a good rate we were then given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was spacious and very comfortable so very good value for the price with side view of dam square staff extremely helpful and courteous very central location lots to see within walking distance trams stop outside and central station a minute walk away we would definitely stay here again
