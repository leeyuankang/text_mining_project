i loved the staff in particular asprilla she really made sure we were comfortable n happy with our room the staff were very helpful indeed the pillow menu was great got the pillows that gave me a good nights sleep the location was excellent with the mall right across the hotel good restaurants around too the tram stop just infront of the hotel not a place for those who are looking for a quite area as this is a very busy area
