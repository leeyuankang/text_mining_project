i absolutely loved this hotel the staff was very accommodating the location was perfect right in the heart of amsterdam s canal area and the decor style of the hotel was fantastic i also loved that there were fresh tulips in the bathroom such a small but special touch i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to amsterdam
