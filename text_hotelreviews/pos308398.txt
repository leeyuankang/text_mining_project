we had a fantastic stay i asked before hand if we could have a room with a view as its located right on dam square excellent when we arrived we were given a free room upgrade with the view also a bottle of bubbles as we were celebrating our year anniversary the hotel staff are fantastic really friendly and informative about what to do and where to go we would really recommend this hotel to anyone it is in a brilliant location within walking distance to all major sites our suite was spotless i ll go as far to say it is the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in and we travel a lot thank you for a great stay
