i booked this hotel thanks to its fantastic location right next to dam square we had a lovely time here the rooms were very comfortable and very reasonably priced the rooms even came with a pillow menu incase you didn t like the ones provided the hotel and staff were exceptionally good to us letting us check in early and leave our bags with them after check out on the last day the final lovely touch was them sending a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room as it was my birthday that day i have absolutly nothing negative to say about my experience at this hotel
