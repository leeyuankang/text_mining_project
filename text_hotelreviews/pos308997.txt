the location was perfect for me close to the akh campus where i needed to be and one minute from a tram stop the staff were extra helpful including things such as getting hold of a kettle which was not in the room by default or a pressing iron and board switching on the heating and taking care of a late arrival didn t try the breakfast but there are excellent options nearby including the lovely cafe florianihof of course it s not a ritz but great value overall especially for vienna
