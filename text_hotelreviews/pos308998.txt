everything was just great the high quality service for this price seems a perfect ratio nice big bathroom with a window very clean stuff is friendly always ready to help and multilingual nice breakfast fast wifi vending machine in the lobby where i could get some snacks was a good advantage i was a bit worrying because of the late check in as the front desk works till six but everything went smoothly with a keybox also great location in the centre everything is within a walking distance definitely will stay there again when coming to vienna thank you for making my stay in vienna so comfy
