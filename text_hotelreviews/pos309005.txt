the lady working at the check in was really kind she even gave us the tip where to park our car and which tickets to get the guy that was with her was rather quiet and seemed uninteressted the bed was really comfortable the electricity is activate with the room key card which is good in one way cause you cant forget to turn off things but its bad cause you cant leave anything to charge while youre out but all in all it was an amazing stay and its really clean and cozy would do it again
