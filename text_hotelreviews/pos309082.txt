the hotel was a lot better than in the pictures on booking com the staff were very friendly as they always are when i visit amsterdam the rooms were spacious with double beds which were very comfortable the bar is very nice we each had a hot drink before bed the barman was very friendly and the ambience is very relaxing unfortunately didn t get to make the most of this hotel and it s facilities as it was literally a stop over for hours we arrived late in the evening to check in and was checking out at to get our connecting flight home i did love the angry birds in the lift
