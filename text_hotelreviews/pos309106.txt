hotel was just amazing myself and my boyfriend traveled to amsterdam for my birthday on june our hotel was in the perfect spot for the tram station and the rai train station getting the tram was the best possible was around amsterdam would definitely recommend getting a tram card for because we kept getting hourly cards for and cost us a lot to get from the hotel to the central of amsterdam hotel staff were so helpful with our many questions about the trams and trains and the best way to get to the central of amsterdam some staff members weren t able to fully understand us and help us fully due to language barriers and all staff members speak different languages for the various nationalities visiting there hotel room was amazing didn t think it would be as nice as what it was hotel room was so big and came with air con which was needed in the night time perfect view from room to see planes taking off and landing as schipol airport was about minutes away recommended the hotel to family as soon as arrived back home as they are hoping to go in future would definitely stay again absolutely perfect stay
