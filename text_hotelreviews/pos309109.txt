the staff at the front desk at the restaurant were all so friendly always very helpful the room was comfortable we loved the firm bed soft pillows the hotel itself was beautiful very clean we of course loved the ipad with angry birds on the elevator the location was a little further from a lot of main attractions but with the tram station being right around the corner it made it super easy to get around it was our first time in the country we were very happy with our stay thank you
