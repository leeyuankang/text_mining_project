we had an early flight so we went to the hotel to just drop out bags as we knew our room wouldn t be ready but when we got there the staff on reception were amazing they upgraded us to an executive suite because our room wasn t ready and they sold us passes for all the attractions and explained how to get to the places i couldn t recommend it highly enough
