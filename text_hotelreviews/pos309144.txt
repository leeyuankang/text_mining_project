we turned up to the hotel and was told the room me and my partner booked was unavailable however the staff upgraded us free of charge and we was seen to our room straight away the staff was very friendly and the room the estate suite was so nice and comfortable i would definitely reccomend this hotel if you are staying in this hotel then literally outside there is a tram service which takes you straight to the city centre and damn square the tram number is the number and it was very convenient
