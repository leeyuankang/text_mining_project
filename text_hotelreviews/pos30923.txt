from the moment we walked through the front door every single member of staff we came into contact with was welcoming courteous and friendly as it was a bank holiday weekend i asked the one of the delightful gentleman at the conceriege on the ground floor what time the shopping centre closed he said he would find out and let me know by the time i reached the reception desk to check in all of minute there was a telephone call for me from concierge letting me know the opening times for the weekend going the extra mile or what amazing attention to detail would stay here again every time well done
