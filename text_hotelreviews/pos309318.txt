staff were extremely friendly and welcoming the hotel was a minute walk from the train station nearby it was extremely clean and modern the shower system in the room was out of this world it had electronic controls to set temperature and could have water come down from the roof rather than the shower head bed was really comfy and everything about it was just nice
