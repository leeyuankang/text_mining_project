the hotel has very nice and original interior it is well organized with friendly staff and great rooms the bed is big and comfortable the bathroom is modern i liked that instead of expensive ironing service the hotel offers a free iron so you can do your ironing yourself also the location is close to metro and train station so you can easily reach the city centre or the airport
