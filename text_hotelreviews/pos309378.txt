the room is quite big the bed was nice and very big that s very rare the wifi was very good in my room but my friend in the room next to mine had a very bad signal the sauna is simple but good maybe a little too hot i know that s the whole point but this is more than it should if you are here on business it s a good option if you want to visit the city it s a bit far
