loved the hotel the room is well kept beautiful and very comforable the beds are super comfy and the nespresso machines in the rooms are just the cherry on top however this hotel is mostly for guests who attend sports events at the ajax amsterdam stadium or concert goers to the ziggo dome its a great location for that purposes only yes
