a modern vibrant hotel with exceptionally well decorated and equipped rooms consisting of hidden storage space wonderful coffee machine quirky paintings on walls an amazing touch button shower and the best toiletries i have ever had in a hotel room a combination of well fitted blinds a luxury supersized bed and absolutely no noise due to the soundproof room i can confidently say this is the best night s sleep i have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world the jaz is in my opinion particularly appealing to younger adults with its location being just a stones throw away from the ajax football stadium and just a simple minute walk from duivendrecht station which is just a few stops from centraal station serving simple food cooked and presented to a very high standard a very reasonably priced hotel for such high quality of standards throughout our stay
