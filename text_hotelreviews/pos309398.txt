the location of the hotel was excellent you couldn t get any closer we went to an event at the amsterdam arena the room was comfy and we had plenty of room the touch controls in shower was cool concept the decor of room was fun and funky the restaurant in the lobby was convenient we liked the open space since we had a big group getting together before the event and the added touch with the dj was nice
