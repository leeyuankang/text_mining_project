this hotel is very new and modern the room was really nice clean and well equipped breakfast was extremely good nice variety with good quality of food and coffee the hotel offers a payed parking for euro per day there is an imax cinema within a few minutes walk the hotel is located in the south eastern part of amsterdam directly next to ziggo dome and ajax arena making it a bit far from the real heart of amsterdam there is a metro station about m away and from there there is a line going directly to the center in total it took us about min to travel to the center of amsterdam for us it was a bit too far especially when we wanted to go out after a long day of sightseeing but on the other hand this area is more quiet and away from all the commotion
