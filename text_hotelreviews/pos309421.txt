the beds were extremely comfortable my friend and i rarely wanted to leave the beds in the morning which is the main reason we missed our free breakfast each day the hotel is very tech savvy if we forgot our key in the room i could unlock the door with the app called hotel bird the staff was very nice and tended to all of our needs the rooms were cleaned each day and the shower is turned on through touch buttons this hotel was amazing and located near the rail station via an easy three to four minute walk restaurants are nearby and in the hotel as well i would definitely stay here again
