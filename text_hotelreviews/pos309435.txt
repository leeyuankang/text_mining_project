housekeeping needs to be improved i m allergic to dust on the day i developed hives there was a feather beside the bed on the floor that was there for days withouth moving easily seen and would have disappeared if simple vacuuming was done tested with a small piece of plastic beside the bed which also remained after the cleaning lovely hotel otherwise with really lovely friendly helpful staff they did change the bedsheets and clean properly after i called housekeeping though the toilet door got stuck and locked by itself and looking a the scratch marks on the lock this was not the first time
