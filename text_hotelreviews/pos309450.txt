loved the extra large bed it was super comfy the price you pay is worth it as you get a room with good space to put your luggage away with enough space to walk around which a lot hotel rooms lack when you pay for standard size rooms i really enjoyed the view of amsterdam arena and surrounding business district the property is located fairly close to metro which made traveling to central amsterdam easier
