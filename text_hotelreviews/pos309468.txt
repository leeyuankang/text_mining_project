this hotel will be my choice for future trips where i will have to stay rather close to the schiphol airport as a translation is just around the corner and the rates are much cheaper than at hotels at the airport itself via a metro line one also has a very fast connection into the inner city of amsterdam so the location is really good for staying over nights
