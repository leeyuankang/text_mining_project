everything seemed pretty much spot on the staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough to helpp so so attentive friendly and polite my absolute highlight of the stay was the mini pancakes that came with breakfast unbelievable although it s not centrally located it s really easy to get to stops on the train to the airport or mins to the centre of town on the tram station is a minute walk away
