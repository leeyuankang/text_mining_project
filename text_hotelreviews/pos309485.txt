we came to amsterdam to see a show at the ziggo dome google maps showed us that jaz was the closest hotel but it did not accurately represent how very close it is it was perfect our room was large clean comfortable and quiet we loved our stay here and if we return for another ziggo dome performance we ll stay at jaz again
