hotel was amazing i could not recommend more staff were lovely hotel clean and very modern biggest and best bed i have ever slept in bathroom was very funky i would rate the hotel and staff and would advise anyone to pick this hotel the only downside was the location for us its very close to the metro however stops on the train to central amsterdam so we did spend a lot of money on cabs in the evening
