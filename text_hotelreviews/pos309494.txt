absolutely amazing hotel not only a comfortable stay but a very fun one incredible design huge bed a little too soft though and one of the greatest breakfasts i had in my life the hotel restaurant is not your typical hotel restaurant this is a great place to hang out cool atmosphere great food and drinks a less than minute walk from the station so you can get on the busy amsterdam canals area within a minute ride let me say this again what a breakfast
