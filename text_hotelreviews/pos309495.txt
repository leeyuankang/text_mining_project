hotel was excellent breakfast had a great selection rooms were very spacious and bed very comfortable it was slightly out of the city centre as expected but only minutes by train and enough shops bars and restaurants by hotel not to be isolated train station was only a minute walk and the ajax stadium was right outside the door brilliant stay would definitely recommend
