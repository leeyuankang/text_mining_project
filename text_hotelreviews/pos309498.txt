a fantastic hotel with a twist very funky set up and room style which was refreshing to see breaks the mould of your typical hotel with bar and restaurant etc for example a dj in the bar fantastic multi function shower in room and overall the staff were so very helpful keen happy and really seemed to enjoy their jobs which gave the place an extra buzz
