this was our first time traveling to europe and we weren t sure what to expect the jaz hotel was perfect they made us feel right at home the staff were very helpful even printed out our tickets to the ajax game for us the location is absolutely perfect just a short walk to the metro station and only minutes ride to centraal station amsterdam the rooms were quiet we would definitely recommend this hotel
