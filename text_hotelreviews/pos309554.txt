excellent hotel short ride from the centre of amsterdam but it is totally worth it rooms are great and the bed is definitely the most comfortable i ve ever slept in there is a late check out option on sunday we didn t use it staff was amazingly customer friendly which does not happen in the netherlands so i was shocked well done though breakfast is included and is sufficient you will find something you like breakfast staff helpful and efficient cannot fault them for anything
