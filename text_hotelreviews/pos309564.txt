great location right next to the ziggo dome and amsterdam arena ajax took from schipol via the train to arrive at hotel and less than to get into the centre of amsterdam rooms were stylish and comfortable perfect black out blinds for a great sleep breakfast was tasty served until we got to eat breakfast on the balcony and enjoyed the live band playing for guests
