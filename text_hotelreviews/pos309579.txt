i would most definitely return to jaz hotel when i next visit amsterdam it is clean modern and extremely comfortable the check in was a little slow but i suspect this is the staff struggling with a complicated booking system rather than them being slow as every member of staff we came into contact with was charming helpful and efficient they also spoke annoyingly good english but to make it easier for others to make a decision let me address two issues which other reviewers have commented on the jaz hotel location in regard to the centre of amsterdam and the breakfast that is provided it will take you around minutes to get to central amsterdam including walking to the metro station and then the journey on the train but to be honest it is so simple it feels a whole lot less it will also give you the chance for a little time away from central amsterdam the location is not picturesque but it does have some great venues you can check out if you are that way inclined breakfast is continental style and offers a huge selection if you want a fry up every morning your not going to find it here but if you are willing to ditch the old british not like i get at home attitude then you will be more than happy with with the selection i found myself getting back home to england and looking in the stores to find the ingredients to have the same type of breakfast at home that i had during our stay
