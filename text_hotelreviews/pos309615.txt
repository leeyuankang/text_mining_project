the hotel itself is very nice modern and worth the money the room was beautifull and it had a really nice corner by the window just to relax rain shower a perfect touch and the display of washing products in bottles a good ideea but the best part is the bed extra comfy and big and the view of ajax arena a plus for men overall a very pleasant stay
