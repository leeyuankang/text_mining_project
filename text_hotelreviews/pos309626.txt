huge comfortable bed it made my own super kingsize look small great value and easy to get into the city centre in around minutes it s usually really quiet around the hotel but it s right next to the ajax stadium we came back to the hotel just before a match one evening and it was unbelievably busy but it was a really great atmosphere even though we weren t supporters one of the best hotels we ve been to
