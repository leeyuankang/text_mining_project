i honestly had low expectations going in because i didn t really do much research on the place outside of the location and cost but after staying there i was more then surprised with the value i got with the food the decor and the staff i was only traveling with one other person but the rooms size was perfect i never felt cramped like in other hotels and the shower wasn t complicated to figure out like any shower away from your home shower also it has free internet everywhere in the hotel which to me you can t get stars for your hotel if you don t have free wifi everywhere in your hotel
