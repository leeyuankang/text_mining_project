really friendly staff happy to help with anything good clean facilities lovely room chef and waiting staff were brilliant and we ended up eating there every day my sister has some allergies and the chef listened carefully and went out of her way to create food that she could eat without worry i am a vegetarian and there was enough choice for me and the food was excellent fresh and tasty
