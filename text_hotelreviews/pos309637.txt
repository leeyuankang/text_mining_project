the location was perfect for us as we wanted to stay as close to ajax stadium as possible it is just a short walk away from stadium and metro train station the hotel is new and very modern it has a really nice bar restaurant with a lively atmosphere the gourmet burgers were great staff are all very friendly as you would expect our room was ok modern with nice bathroom overall we were very happy with our stay at this hotel
