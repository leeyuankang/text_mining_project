the whole hotel and rooms were really modern and nicely designed public transport was easy to access less than minutes to walk to the metro where you can take a tram directly into the city center we parked at the park ride arena next to the hotel and paid just euros to park for the whole weekend perfect for anybody going to a concert at the ziggo dome even though our room faced the adjacent square ziggo dome venue which was full of people late at nightt the room was incredibly quiet an awesome futuristic shower huge tv and excellent breakfast selection made our stay superb
