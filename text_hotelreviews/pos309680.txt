such a cool hotel with a great design and modern look different in many ways than other hotels i ve stayed in i liked the jaz music related objects chairs looking like drums breakfast areas looking like stages walls looking like concert audience etc the hotel also has great modern facilities to turn on the shower and set the temperature you need to push some buttons and to order a cappuccino at breakfast to need to click on an ipad app the room was big with a huge comfy bed and nice mini couches near the window to read a book or simply relax the design was also very nice the hotel is located right near amsterdam arena so in case you plan to attend a concert or a football game it s the perfect place to accommodate
