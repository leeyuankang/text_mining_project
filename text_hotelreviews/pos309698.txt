the staff are nothing but helpful here anything we wanted it was no problem we checked in hours before it said our room was ready but it was ready already then we d forgot our adapters but it was no hassle they had some at reception for us to borrow breakfast is served until noon which is amazing when you have a hangover and you can have a late check out until at no extra cost we ate in the restaurant one night and the food was amazing and very reasonably priced the beds are so comfortable and the rooms are very modern extremely clean and the tv even had english channels i would stay here again even though it is a tram ride away from the centre of amsterdam you are only a min walk away from the station and it is only return be warned do not get a taxi back from the centre of amsterdam at night it cost us not the hotel s fault though just a friendly pointer
