everything was perfect the hotel is near a metro station minutes by foot to the station then minutes with metro to amsterdam centraal in front of amsterdam arena and ziggo dome the room is large with a special design the bathroom looks well with some high tech facilities the bed is big and comfortable there is a good breakfast the internet connection works well one of the best hotels that i stayed in highly recommended the price of the room may be a little problem but it worths the money
