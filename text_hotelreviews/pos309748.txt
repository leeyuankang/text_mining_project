excellent hotel even though it is not located downtown it was very easy to get to the heart of amsterdam five minutes walk around amsterdam arena to bijlmer arena station and then minutes in the metro and your are in the city center simply one of the best hotels i have been to very modern in style design and technology i checked in and out of the hotel with app in my phone breakfast was very good and the mattress in our bed was excellent
