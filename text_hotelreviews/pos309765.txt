breakfast was so relaxed you didn t have to wait at all even when it got busier at the weekend the food choice was tasty the room was lovely and comfortable the cleaning staff were most helpful with filling up the coffee even when we didn t need the room cleaned the rain shower was a added surprise transport no problem walk and catch the metro to the city centre or hop off along the way no other place for us to stay than the jaz hotel we zullen terugkomen
