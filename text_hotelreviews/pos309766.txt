room was very very clean all was great in the room and a very nice view over the hills breakfast is quite good enough and a lot to choose from for european standards it is good it is located outside the city center however it takes minutes to get to the metro station and another minutes to the city center central station and it is quite fast also to get to the airport takes you minutes by direct train the team is young professional and always helpful very nice staff we arrived after midnight the kitchen was already closed and they still baked us a pizza for dinner amazing room facilities maybe the price was a bit higher based on the outside cirty center location but it is still acceptable
