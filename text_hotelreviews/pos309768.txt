this hotel is absolutely beautiful me and my boyfriend spent nights at the jaz hotel and were extremely impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff the interior blew us away the decor both in the room and throughout the breakfast and dining area was stunning the food at breakfast was typical european breakfast accompanied by fresh juice all of which was very delicious the staff on reception were very welcoming both on arrival and whenever we returned to the hotel after being in the city also the cleaning staff and staff at breakfast were also very friendly and cheery every morning the hotel is about a minute ride on the metro from the city centre with the trains being so frequent this wasn t an issue and was in fact better in my opinion you could leave the bustle of the city and return to a beautiful room to relax and recover
