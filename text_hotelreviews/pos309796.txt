really clean rooms and very comfortable beds the location is beyond amazing if you re looking to catch a football game at amsterdam arena or a concert at ziggo dome city center is only minutes away with train and the station is a couple of minutes walk away the staff was also really easy going and accommodating overall one of the best hotel experiences i ve had and way beyond expectation for the price paid also some amazing orange juice at breakfast
