well where do i start it was our very first stay in amsterdam and we picked this hotel due to us attending a concert at the ziggo dome arena and oh my did i make an amazing choice a choice which started off the perfect stay in a beautiful city the arena was literally attached to the hotel which impressed us and the transport to central amsterdam was a about minute walk away from the hotel and took about minutes overall on the metro so nobody can complain i would recommend buying a day pass for the metro buses and trams as you save a fortune the staff at the hotel were very friendly from start to finish and will help you any way they possible can from the checkin desk to the bar and restaurant etc fantastic and especially the young lad who served us in the resurant on a evening i forgot his name but i know he s from london who has only been in amsterdam a few months he was so pleasant and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job which is wonderful to see so thumbs up to him and all the other staff i was that impressed with the hotel we are booking again for my birthday in august and can not wait to come back i did say we would stop more central if we went back as we only picked this hotel for the concert but i don t want to stop anywhere else as it was a wonderful stay and made an everlasting impression well done all and see you again soon x p s when traveling by taxis from the airport watch out for unmarked taxis as they are like vulchers and make you feel very intimidated as well as probably charging you a fortune don t be fooled use the main airport taxis which is located by signs throughout the airport pps the beds are that big and comfortable you have to be forced out of it so beware
