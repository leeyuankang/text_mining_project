very hip and colorful place it is next to the amsterdam arena and ziggo dome so if you want to visit any of these the location is perfect public transport is minute walk and takes you in min in the center of amsterdam staff is friendly beds are great maybe they could fill the mini bar with more than just one water but that is all would recommend this to anyone who will stay more than day in amsterdam high value for money
