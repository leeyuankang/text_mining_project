for those who read this review and potentially for a year or to come this is definitely the best hotel in amsterdam when compared to the money you pay i paid less than euros for a single use of a double room it is really modern really clean and transport is very good to the city centre arena station is a good minute walk on a pedestrian street to the hotel and it is a minute train or minute metro trip to the central station i was there on a sunday and the breakfast was very good and there was even a band playing for breakfast some nice jazz music the staff is young and very natural no pretending or complications just easy going helpful staff you write your email for example yourself on an ipod which the staff member holds i loved the various tv stations perhaps in most hotels with british channels german french and italian channels etc and the shower is equipped with electric buttons for exact temperature if you are ok with the minute trip to central station and minute walk to the hotel then this is the best or euros you can pay in busy expensive amsterdam no need to think much
