i loved the fresh industrial chic exactly my type of decor i built my own bed from scaffolding so its safe to say that we share the same artistic taste the food was lovely and fresh staff approachable and upbeat the environment was simply joyous the music for breakfast was upbeat dance music but not too energetic every detail was on point and i loved the light humour dotted everywhere that signified that the hotel doesn t take life too seriously located only two stops from the airport to the east about mins on the train and mins on the tram to the city centre it s right by amsterdam arena so would be ideal if staying for a sporting event i promise that i don t work for the hotel either feel free to run a background check in years of working in the airline industry i ve stayed in my fair share of hotels and can easily say that this stands head shoulders feet and stilts above any of my other stays others feel so too it scored highest on other comparison sites too
