staff are friendly it is a brand new hotel so when we arrived they had a problem checking us in because their systems were down but they resolved everything quickly breakfast area is lovely the bar facilities are good and i certainly feel that this hotel will succeed i am happy to come back maria front of house really looked after us however english breakfast tea and milk needs to be included in your room also you need to have two cups not one cup to share between two people for the nespresso lovely showers as well and great rooms
