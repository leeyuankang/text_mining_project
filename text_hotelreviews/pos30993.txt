the hotel is ideally situated for the westfield shopping centre and only a short trip by tube to reach the my second one night stay this year and again enjoyed good service a great breakfast and friendly approachable staff a good example was that i had inadvertantly booked a twin room instead of a double and on arrival the receptionist seeing we were a couple asked us whether we would prefer a double room which we were pleased to accept
