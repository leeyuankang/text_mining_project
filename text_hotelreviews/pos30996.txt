we stayed at the holiday inn for one night i found all the staff to be very polite and friendly our room was very clean and comfortable and had a very good bathroom with a shower and a bath we went to breakfast at so everything was fresh and there was a very good choice i don t eat meat and would not normally have a cooked breakfast but it looked so tempting i could not resist i was pleased to see the eggs mushrooms etc were kept separate from the meat dishes
