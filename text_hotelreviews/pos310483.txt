we liked the room and the bathroom a lot it s next to tram stop makes it convenient to downtown it had a nespresso machine in the room very happy to see that loved the space and view nice view spacious and overall well maintained location is far out to the west of amsterdam but on average it takes about minutes on the tram to get to central station the lounge is spacious and well laid out
