besides what i have said the restaurant is quite good and so is breakfast it was a pleasant surprise to me used to some quite bad experiences in amsterdam this is a new and very high tech hotel to get to the center you get the tram just in front and you re in the middle of everything in minutes i highly recommend this hotel
