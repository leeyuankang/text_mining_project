the hotel is complete hi tech self check in including self key creation and self check out automation made all operations very efficient though we are widely traveled world over this is the first place i saw automated electronic mini bar it s thru a small vending machine in the room and gets automatically added to your room charges in case of any consumption the rooms very large with all necessary amenities including a wonderful coffee maker beds were comfortable and bathrooms very clean and good though the location is little away from downtown it really didn t matter as a tram stop is right opposite the hotel within minutes you are able to reach the central attraction points being pure vegetarians we really didn t use the restaurant but was not a problem as there is a super market round the corner for all necessary daily needs
