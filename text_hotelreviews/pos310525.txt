as usual we enjoyed this hotel when staying in amsterdam living in a quiet neighbourhood enjoying large lidl supermarket nearby and at the same time meters from the entrance to the tram stop which takes you to the center of the city the hotel also has great facilities like toiletries and coffee machine
