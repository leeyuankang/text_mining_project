this hotel is conveniently located by a stop for the tram which goes to the centraal station the train station for amsterdam the tram trip to centraal station takes about half an hour and the trams run frequently the hotel also has a parking structure for those driving by car and they rent bicycles central amsterdam is very suitable for pedestrians and bicyclists and not so suitable for cars so it make sense to take the tram in and walk or bicycle the hotel s breakfast buffet is excellent it is slightly cheaper euros instead of euros if you book it in advance the night before thus hotel s wifi is excellent which is not true of all of the moderately priced hotels in europe where i have stayed
