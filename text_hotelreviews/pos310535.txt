the best hotel i have ever been to the bed was really comfortable and the clearness was excellent java cleaner did a great job the gym has a hotel with basic but good equipment to work out every morning at not extra cost the location on my opinion was brilliant it was not that close to the main attractions but it was really good communicated in terms of transport the tram stop was less than minutes away from the hotel and you can also buy any travel card bus tram from the hotel and within minutes you will be in the iamsterdan sign and museums in addition the check in and check outs are done really quick to conclude i highly recommend it
