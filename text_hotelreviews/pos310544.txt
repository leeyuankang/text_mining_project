overall good hotel clean and modern rooms good to stay at if you don t need to be in the very center of the city very good public transport connection to the center and can be reached quickly yet the hotel is in a quite area for amsterdam it was a good value for money although hotels in amsterdam are generally more expensive than other similar cities
