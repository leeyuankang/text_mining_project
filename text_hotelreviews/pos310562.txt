the area is quiet but the tram n stops just in front of the hotel and takes you to the city centre in less than minutes bonus point it will take you next to all the main attractions it s also pretty easy to get there from and to the airport train metro the room was very clean and tidy with all that you need including hair drier slippers and ironing board i particularly enjoyed the possibility to select from inside the room if we wanted it to be made up or we were resting i also appreciated the smart tv and the good wi fi i d recommend it even for a business trip we had the possibility to store our luggage for free after the check out note this is a smoking and alcohol free hotel
