the bathroom had a floor heater suitable during cold days we got a room on the hook so it was perfect it was fully self check in shortened the line you can take the tram directly to the amsterdam city passing rijksmuseum to dam centraal it was right in front of the hotel the hotel environment was very quiet yet peaceful we really had a great experience with this hotel definitely will stay at this hotel again
