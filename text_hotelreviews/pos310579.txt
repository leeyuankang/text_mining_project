a plush clean outfit with all the trappings one might expect from a hotel of precisely this calibre i found it quite worthwhile for the price i paid the photos attached to this listing are very accurate and paint a perfect picture of what to expect for the nights of especial note is that the restaurant downstairs was at least when i stayed in may staffed by at least one very capable chef i went in expecting standard hotel fare but the food i had was startlingly robust and warrants praise i think it s making me a little hungry even now p s i was also assisted by a very cheerful courteous and originally indonesian member of staff from whom i forgot to ask a name but i felt his work ethic deserved a little vocal acclaim so i ll mention it here in post script
