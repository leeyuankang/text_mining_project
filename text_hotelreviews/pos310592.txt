property was excellent great value for money lovely large bedroom and bathroom with really good hair dryer iron and toiletries we managed to get an earlier checkin as well so quite accommodating breakfast was which was really good a choice of hot and cold food to set you up for the day also no charge to use computer and print off booking itinerary the hotel was about by tram from central station but the tram was right outside the hotel and in fact it only took minutes to get to museum place and the start of all the attractions in amsterdam really enjoyed the location as the homes around the area and vondelpark were magnificent so also a lovely walk into central amsterdam nothing too far at all and area called cornelis schuystraat had nice restaurants and just lovely to walk around and can enter the vondelpark from there
