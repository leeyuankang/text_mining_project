the hotel was great excellent value for money especially compared to other places in amsterdam the room looked like a star hotel room there was complimentary nespresso coffee in the room which was refilled each day the shower was perfect and the bed was really comfortable we used the automated check in which was very convenient the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful when we had questions or needed something
