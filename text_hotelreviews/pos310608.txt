location is good though a bit far from the city centre it takes almost mins by the tram but the tram no makes it convenient as the stop is just outside the hotel room was nice but a little bit bigger room would have been better as it was a triple bedded room the other facilities were nice front desk staff were really very helpful there are supermarkets very close to the property about to mins walk from the hotel which is very convenient there are few restaurants also in the area again a short walk of to mins from the hotel schiphol airport is about mins by taxi
