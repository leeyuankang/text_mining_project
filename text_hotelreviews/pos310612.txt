very nice hotel well equipped with everything one needs for a comfortable stay the hotel is located about mins from central and there is a tram right outside which is very convenient and trams run very regularly for the lazy bunch best to take an uber i would definitely recommend this place to anyone for leisure and business laundry service was good and on time
