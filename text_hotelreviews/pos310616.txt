couldn t have asked for a more pleasant stay location was beyond perfect tram right outside our door bedroom were very clean spacious bed was so comfortable although we didn t spend much time in the room it is always nice to come back to comfortable relaxed space to chill out we arrived earlier than our check in time but the staff gladly took our luggage so that we could make the most of our extra few hours to sightseeing prior to check in will definitely be coming back and will definitely be recommending this hotel to anybody who will listen to me
