excellent staff they are very friendly polite and eager to help they are all really nice people easy access to the tram there is a stop right in front of the hotel and with at least a minute ride you can get to many places to eat breakfast lunch and dinner or go all the way to the city center simple but nice gym it has a pull up bar dip station dumbbells up to if i recall correctly both an adjustable incline bench and a flat one and although it doesn t have a squat rack you can do a full body routine if you know what you are doing it also has treadmills if that is your thing
