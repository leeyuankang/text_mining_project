hotel looked good room was very well decorated and modern looking bathroom excellent i hadn t read anywhere that there was no bar facilities when realising there was no bar we thought we would use the minibar in our room which happened to be a vending machine with about six options the only two alcohol options on the machine was beer and a gin and tonic mix when trying to purchase it said sold out so we contacted reception to be told there was no alcohol permitted for sale on the premises i wish i had known that before booking the holiday disappointed is an understatement considering we are so far out from central amsterdam staff were friendly tram is less than two minutes from front door of hotel and run frequently enough overall a nice enough stay although pricey enough for what we got with no options for an alcoholic beverage at the end of the day
