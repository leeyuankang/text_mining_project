very stylish modern hotel with excellent and comfortable facilities wonderful views helpful polite staff and a frankly awesome carpet that reminds me of space invaders no problem getting more coffee pods for the room at any time and special room requests always honoured great location right next to frequent trams right into the city centre with several supermarkets just a few minutes walk away
