excellent location as tram stops right across the road minutes to the centre by tram number also getting to and from the hotel to the airport was easily reachable by tram and then a bus hotel was comfortable and clean room was modern nicely decorated and the bathroom was lovely we felt that the breakfast was a little pricey at euro per person but there was a quite a good choice if we return to amsterdam in the future we would definitely consider staying here again
