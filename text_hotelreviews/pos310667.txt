the location is great although it is relatively far from the city center you can take the tram which goes there in less then minutes moreover the amsterdam lelylaan train station is just minutes walking from the hotel and after minutes more on the train you are in schiphol airport the neighbourhood is nice nespresso coffee machine with complementary coffee is such a basic thing but only a few hotels really provide it staff is perfectly hospitable and helpful the payment is much more easier then in many other hotels you just pay what you expect no deposits or anything like that
