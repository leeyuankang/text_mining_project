property is very modern and decorated very well there is a tram right outside that takes you to all the places you need to go around amsterdam and is so easy to get around on staff at hotel were all very friendly food also very nice and room was amazing this hotel is awesome would come back here again and again minutes away from major attractions and centre situated in a quiet location but didn t ever seem to far away
