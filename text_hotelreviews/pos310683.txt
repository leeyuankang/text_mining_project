the room was absolutely stunning and the staff were so friendly and the location was perfect not in the city centre but the tram right outside brings you everywhere will definitely be back so accessible and easy to find especially after getting off a flight definately avail of the tram tickets sold at reception they are so handy and save all the hustle of looking for change
