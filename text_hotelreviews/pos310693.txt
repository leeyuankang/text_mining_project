i was so impressed with the standard of this hotel it exceeded our expectations greatly the room was beautiful and modern and the bathroom was so luxurious the cleaning staff left the room looking spotless every morning and the reception staff were more than helpful with anything we needed great transport links with the city centre tram stopping right outside the hotel and about a journey into the very heart of amsterdam central really reccomend this hotel if you don t mind staying out a little from the main square but still want to experience everything
