loved the room it was so comfortable and spacious the coffee machine in the bedroom was an amazing bonus the bathroom was gorgeous and the refills of the toiletries every day was lovely the map the hotel provides on entry is brilliant and even though the hotel itself was outside of the main centre the tram is right outside the door and the map definitely helped with getting around
