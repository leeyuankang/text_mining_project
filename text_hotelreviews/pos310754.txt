i loved this hotel i was staying for a few nights around nye and was looking for somewhere that would be close to the city but still calm and peaceful this was perfect it s right beside a tram line that goes to all the major tourist attractions but is itself in a residential neighborhood it also offers easy access to the airport which is always a bonus the room was a perfect size for two and boasts a nespresso coffee machine comfortable beds a good sized wardrobe and a decent work space essential for those of that always have some kind of work to do i only bought breakfast twice during my stay as seemed a little expensive but really it was worth it in terms of quality and choice
