as my partner and i normally stay in hostels this was the absolute lap of luxury the bathroom was incredible i spent a ridiculous amount of time in the rain shower every morning it was beautiful the bed was super comfy and the thermostat meant you could easily warm up cool down the room overall it was a fab stay even if slightly more than i would ve wanted to pay not in the centre of dam but there s a tram stop literally right outside that takes you right to the centre and is very frequent
