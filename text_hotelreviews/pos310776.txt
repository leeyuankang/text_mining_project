the location the tram stop was literally right outside the front door the staff were very helpful and very polite the quietness of the rooms and hotel in general the design of the rooms and the decoration was to a high standard close enough to the heart of the city but far enough to be out of the noise and rush of the city when you wanted to retire and relax not would you but definitely will stay here again
