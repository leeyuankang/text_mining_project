the room bathroom were marvellous fully equipped modern interior etc also large garage with lots of parking spots and with enough space for most cars perfect for everyone who travels with his car the staff is very friendly and polite and they really like to help you the only downside to the hotel is its location it is far outside the center and because there is no tram shortly after midnight you have to take the expensive taxi because driving around with your own car around amsterdam is the horror and parking is eur per hour since you know that before booking i won t add this to the cons
