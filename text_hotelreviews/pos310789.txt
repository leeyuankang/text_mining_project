the locaties of the hotel is fair enough regarding the rates tram stop in front of the hotel is definitely a plus also the room is really comfortable with a really nice shower and looks really cosy most of the staff were really kind and nice also the system in the room for do not disturb and clean my room is really nice the minibar in the room never saw it like this but really easy and good to use but didn t noticed enough space if you bought some stuff to keep it cool breakfast is ok not special but fine
