great comfortable hotel out of the centre of amsterdam came with a free parking deal which was ideal as this was our final stop on a week long road trip around germany and definitely beat paying to park closer in to get into the city centre was only a min tram ride with the tram stop handily located just outside the hotel we would definitely stay again
