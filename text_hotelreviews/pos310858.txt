the location of this hotel was excellent it is set in a quiet area away from the hustle of the city centre but only a minute tram ride to everything the tram stop is right outside the hotel the hotel is well decorated and very clean with helpful staff there is bus train team and metro stops all within a minute walk and these are all very frequent
