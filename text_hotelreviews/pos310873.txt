the room was very appealing and luxurious it had a smart tv air conditioning and it was quite high tech overall the bed was also incredibly comfortable it didn t squeak at all and was the perfect combination of firm and soft the mini bar was great although i wish it had more choices room service is also available with reasonable prices and pretty decent food options the bathroom was also very nice the shower had a rainfall showerhead and a retractable one as well
