although not located in the city central easily reliably efficiently accessible anywhere by tram room is new spacious clean and tidy with daily room tidy up effort reserving breakfast in advance can gain discount and the breakfast is good and well served surrounding is quiet and calm and we did accommodate there for a week without any disturbances overall highly recommend
