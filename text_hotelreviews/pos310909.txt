i liked everything about the hotel the stuff was very friendly and helpful breakfast was really good topped with fresh orange juice and lots of fresh fruits the room design and colours as well as the fresh and modern interior makes one feel really positive things like the locker with no extra charge iron in the cabinet coffee machine and free water in the room is an added extra to pleasantly surprise the guests and no matter it looks far from the city centre the tram runs right from the hotel door to the city and works till late at night so no worries so far one of the best hotels i ever stayed in
