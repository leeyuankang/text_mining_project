good localization close to the city center but far enough from all the tourists nice neighbourhood very close to tram which goes to all the city s attractions near the hotel are stores where you could buy food and drinks we liked bathroom a lot and the smart tv was cool we had nice stay and when we go back we would definately stay there again
