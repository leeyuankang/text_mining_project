really great hotel with beautiful rooms clean friendly located min by tram from city center it is really better because center is too noisy as for me tram station is right at the hotel door supermarket one block away we were allowed to check on really earlier stuff helped us with any our questions and requests it was very convenient to leave to airport from lelyand station min walking
