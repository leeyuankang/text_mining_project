a great hotel with modern faculties suitably located ousted the tram taking you directly into the centre of amsterdam or directly to amsterdam central station on the no tram i recommend buying the travel card which include the bus train and tram for euros per adult s thai works out cheaper than paying each time about mins on the train to the city centre nice to be located amongst the dutch people as the community feel is very present not many places to eat around the hotel but there is room service and it s easy to get to the centre
