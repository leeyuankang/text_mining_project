staff was helpful i was allowed to prolong the check out by hour and got my money back for the breakfast i paid but eventually did not have at the hotel nice comfortable and spacey room the location was perfect for me for the purpose of my visit however it is not close to the main train station amsterdam centraal it s about half an hour away by a tram ride though
