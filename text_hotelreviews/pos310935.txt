we arrived at the hotel and received a free upgrade from the standard double room we had booked this was a nice surprise and the staff member who greeted us was lovely and friendly our room was clean and tidy with great views check in and check out was smooth this was our third stay at this hotel in months and we wouldn t hesitate to stay again at such a great price
