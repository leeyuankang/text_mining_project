while not in the city centre the tram line bang outside the hotel takes you straight to all the key city centre places without any changes required excellent breakfast and helpful staff with comfortable clean and quiet rooms amsterdam is a little pricey but this hotel definitely represents excellent value for money would love to stay here again
