very comfortable and pleasant stay the rooms were very tidy and the complimentary coffee was very good they were restocked and the bed was made up whenever you needed we could go out for the day and come back to a spotless tidy room the staff were very helpful and there was free luggage keeping for how long you need it for the tram stop was also right outside the hotel which was extremely handy would stay there again it was fantastic
