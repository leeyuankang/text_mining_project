the room was great clean comfortable communication with staff prior to our stay also very good had hoped to get into the room earlier because of an early international flight arrival and although no promises were made i think i should have been made aware of that as it became clear that the hotel was booked up and early access to a room wasn t going to be possible loved the great quality coffee maker and coffee bathroom needs more hooks to hang up garments and towels
