one straight tram line into the city and up to central station so so easy it s out of the way of the hubbub of the city and only minutes tram in couldn t walk it though and i wouldn t recommend cycling in either staff so friendly and couldn t do enough free weights at the gym breaky was great but smoked salmon would be a bonus
