staying again within days means we enjoyed our stay excellent staff great facilities very clean and modern property swift check in and quick check out are some of the many positives about the property location just a bit outside the city centre but then tram number stops right at the door our luggage was stored safely for days making our trip to scandinavia and iceland lighter shall stay here again on our next trip
