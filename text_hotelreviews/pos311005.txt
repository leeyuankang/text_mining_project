good location the tram line stops right in front of the hotel and takes you to the city center in minutes is also close to the airport minutes with a taxi which costs friendly helpful staff also no waiting time at the reception luckily although it was sometimes really crowded really nice spacious rooms it even has a nespresso machine included supermarket lidl is only a few minutes walking distance away minutes approx nice lobby and reception area luggage storage room
