we had a wish concerning the location of the room we would get and the request was granted they have very competent and friendly staff especially at the reception quite unusual that front office staff also handle the bar but only for coffee and soft drinks very practical access from the garage into the hotel excellent choice at the breakfast buffet to go to town center there is a tram station right across the road no need to use your car
