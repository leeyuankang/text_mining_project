staff was great very accommodating even though they seem to be low in staff they helped each other out talking about teamwork i also liked that was in front of the hotel very convenient to get to the rijkmeseum van gogh and dam square and takes you all the way to the centraal station train to from airport is also close you can take the tram and metro but it would probably take longer by waiting it is only away if you decide to walk great quick exercise our room was great spacious and lots of storage and natural lighting bathroom was very nice with the rain shower shower head and the heated floors in the bathroom and soundproof were a great bonuses breakfast wasn t the best but i got my eggs bacon sausage and cappuccino and that s all i needed to get me through the morning
