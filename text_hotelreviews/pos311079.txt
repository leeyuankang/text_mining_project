joanne on reception is an asset to the hotel nothing was too much trouble loved the room and bathroom the coffee machine and lots of usb points are nice touches good value breakfast with lots of choice the tram stop outside the hotel makes it easy to get into the city centre also some nice restaurants a couple of tram stops or short stroll away
