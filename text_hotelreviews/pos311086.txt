i was concerned when i saw how far from the city center the hotel was the tram station was right out front and it was less than hour back to the station and minutes to the museums the hotel was great the breakfasts were terrific the staff was wonderful when we checked out they even had a luggage room to store our bags after we checked so we could sightsee without them
