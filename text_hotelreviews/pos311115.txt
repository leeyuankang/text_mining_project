loved the rainfall shower and nespresso coffee machine breakfast was delicious plenty of choices bed was large and comfy we were upgraded free of charge as i had previously emailed to tell them my husband was in crutches staff were extremely helpful when i asked for them to decorate the room and purchase a cake for my husbands birthday although it probably didn t cost anywhere near as much as i had to pay them but was lovely
