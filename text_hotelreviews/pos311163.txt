the room was perfect up to date with technology had a safe for all the valuables and very clean enjoyed breakfast very much however thought there would be more of an option with regards to eggs e g fried poached soft boiled egg this is me being very picky located perfectly the tram stop was just outside the hotel which gets you into the centre very easily
