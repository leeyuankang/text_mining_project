the room was nicely decorated and overall clean nice view comfortable bed pillows view the noise from the highway close by was present but the isolation was pretty good so no real disturbance from that breakfast was good a bit far out of town but i found that to be a plus as it was quieter that in city hotels and going in and from the city was quite easy on the pleasant tram line i liked the hotel and i would definitely recommend it
