the location for me was extreamly well thought out the main tram is a min walk from the hotel which takes you to all the places you want to be in amsterdam the hotel has all the amendaties you require i would for sure stay there again the room was well equiped and cleaned daily the hotel also offers discounted coupons on all major tourist attractions and they do your bookings for you should you require it for certain attractions
