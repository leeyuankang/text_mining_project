stayed here for nights and got a really good deal in comparison to what other hotels were charging for nights was slightly cautious but had nothing to worry about quick check in on self service machines large room with huge bed and a spacious bathroom with a nice big shower quiet hotel clean room everything you d expect paid for breakfast the first morning as it was each and was unsure about booking for the whole stay seemed quite experience but was pleasantly surprised good variety of cereals pastries hot food cold meats and cheese fruit yogurts etc also breakfast was so didn t need to worry about getting up early
