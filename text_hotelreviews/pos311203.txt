the stay was amazing and its one of the best hotels in amsterdam a little off from the centre but you have a very convenient tram stop right in front of the hotel which made life easier but best western was unexpectedly provided an awesome room with a good space and all the facilities neat and clean plush bathrooms i would re book it in a jiffy
