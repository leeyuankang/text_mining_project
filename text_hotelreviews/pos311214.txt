the staff was absolutely astounding very very friendly and helpful we felt right at home the view that we had was over one of the canals and it was just beautiful getting to the city centre was pretty easy just take the number which is right across the hotel till you get to leidsplein dam square rijkismusseum transportation was a piece of cake honestly and to get to the the central station we only went there once would be mins and it was never boring everytime we passed by places in the tram it was as if we could always find something new to see overall it was such a comfortable stay
