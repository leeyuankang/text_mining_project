the hotel staff were attentive and friendly and were always on hand to help my room was very spacious and always immaculately cleaned i loved having the nespresso machine in the room what a treat if you run out of nespresso pods just pop down to the hotel bar at any time for unlimited supplies the rain shower head was a real treat after a day of cycling and touring very luxurious my bed was super comfy and a joy to climb into every night i didn t sample the hotel breakfast but i would recommend that you try the hotel restaurant to sample their delicious evening menu i was impressed after the first forkful and would definitely eat there again although in a slightly quieter part of town the hotel is easy to locate tram number stops right outside which also takes you right into the city centre and heemstedestraat metro station is a minute walk away you will need to change at amsterdam zuid for the metro to centraal station the lovely vondelpark is about a minute tram ride away i would highly recommend renting yourself a bike it took me a brisk ride of minutes to get from the hotel to the centre of town and i felt like a true amsterdamer i stayed at the hotel in november so it was ok as i didn t need to open a window but i would mention that if you plan to stay in the summer be aware that the hotel abuts the so you will hear a lot of background traffic with the window open with the windows closed the only real noise i was aware of was the occasional siren passing by
