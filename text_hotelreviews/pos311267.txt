this hotel is located in amsterdam west away from the hustle and bustle of the main center yet surrounded by a peaceful area and a little canal tram station is just outside the hotel and would take you to the center in to mins we discovered a great bargain store a grocery and kebab restaurant around the corner ask the front desk for the directions the rooms are spacious beautifully designed and very comfortable great to travel with a baby there was even a coffee machine very nice staff who also helped us with an early check in great experience and highly recommended
