the staff were amazing when i rang up to tell them i d left my sunglasses in the room they ensured they came back to me immediately which i really appreciated as they were expensive glasses the hotel has a great location with a tram stop right outside of it so it s easy to get into the centre of amsterdam and trams are so regular the rooms have everything you could need and was well worth the money
