truly impressive property built on top of roman ruins quite visible in sections the architecture is a blend of medieval arches paintings spanning several centuries and modern design from the noted architect rafael moneo the rooms were spacious and elegantly furnished ours had a modest balcony facing a narrow street in the barrio gotico the location is perfect relatively quiet yet a short walk from all the centers of activity the staff is extraordinarily helpful and engaged
