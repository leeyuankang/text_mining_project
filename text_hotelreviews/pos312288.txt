the staff was exceptional small but comfortable room outstanding location i would highly recommend but be aware of things we needed to arrange private transfer as the taxi s don t want to or can t navigate the small roads it with a private transfer through the hotel they were able to connect with the hotel and meet us at the bottom of the hill with luggage cart the concierges were outstanding and coordinated everything perfectly the rooms are very dark poor lighting but honestly the staff service beautiful in room extras robe slippers etc for this small hotel far surpass any brand name
