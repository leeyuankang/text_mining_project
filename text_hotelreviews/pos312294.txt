the best things about the hotel were the fantastic location in the gothic quarter the excellent high standard of the rooms and the staff who were all lovely and friendly the two concierges in particular were very helpful about all sorts of things from booking restaurants to giving advice and practical help when my daughter was taken ill thank you to all the staff you are a credit to this hotel
