staff were always very friendly and helpful with any request the bedroom was kept clean and replenished with a discreet turn down service the food was superb both at breakfast and throughout the day lovely intimate hotel highly recommended once you got your bearings the location was ideal for many attractions and to be part of the buzz of the gothic quarter although once inside the hotel it was very calm and quiet so you were never disturbed by the festivals the nearest metro station is only a very short walk away in order to visit those attractions further afield we were able to reach la sagrada familia very quickly from the location of this hotel
