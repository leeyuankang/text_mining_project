wow wow wow we were treated to a glass of cava on both our very warm welcome and departure at the mercer hotel the mercer hotel is steeped in history and is situated in the very picturesque and interesting gothic district which is the nicest part of barcelona because of the general atmosphere although barcelona is lovely wherever you choose to stay the mercer hotel is very intimate and the staff are exceptionally friendly professional and helpful and willing to go that extra mile without being asked you should experience at least one meal in the restaurant what a treat
