the staff was excellent and the bed was super comfy location of our room not that great our view was of lower income housing and hanging laundry but besides that the room was great the outlet in the bathroom for the hairdryer needs some work because the plug kept falling out while i blew my hair dry which was rather annoying but location staff breakfast and room overall were great
