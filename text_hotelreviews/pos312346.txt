excellent staff very friendly and extremely helpful from the receptionists to the concierge to the doormen and the waiters and waitresses location is as good as it gets if you appreciate historical centres even if most taxis will only get you close to the hotel but not right up to it the property has been most professionally renovated and our room was very comfortable indeed and cleanliness was impeccable we look forward to going back to the hotel and renewing our new friendships
