the facilities are beautiful and the service was impeccable upon arrival florencia provided us with all the information about the hotel and she helped us with suggestions for places to see and directions for wherever we wanted to go the breakfast every day was tailored to our liking from the first day when noemi was the server of my french egg white omelet for which i am grateful to the chef as well noemi proved helpful in many ways other than serving breakfast and we looked forward to starting our day off with her and alesh who also helped facilitate our unexpected last minute check out when he brought us room service our last morning we also enjoyed the roof top bar especially talking with albert about spain as well as the delicious smoothie he made the doormen including paolo and the ukrainian who speaks languages were also helpful and friendly and we enjoyed seeing them every day i must also thank the doorman who helped us with our luggage all the way to the cathedral when our air transport was unable to pick us up any closer than that he was great i also loved the molton brown deep cleansing mineral face wash and am disappointed to find that i cannot buy it anywhere but can only get it from a hotel any you can spare me
