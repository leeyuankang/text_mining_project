clean rooms decent bed good air conditioning supportive and easy to deal with reception staff we preferred to have breakfast outside the hotel so can t comment on breakfast outstanding location just a couple of minutes away from grocery shops restaurants and subway and tram stops and for those who like a mcdonald s nearby there is one just minutes away
