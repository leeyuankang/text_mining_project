the rooms were a good size with comfortable beds a small desk and a lovely bathroom with rain shower perfect for my business trip but i would also stay here on leisure without any issues it is not a luxury hotel where you would spend hours lazing in your room but you wouldn t expect that for the price and who would want to travel to vienna to stay inside breakfast was all you need the coffee is great and the omelette big enough for two
