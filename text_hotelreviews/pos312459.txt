i loved my stay in this hotel it was great coming back to the hotel after long hours of walking around vienna the hotel design is beautiful it s a beautiful space both in the room and in the common areas cafe reception hall etc staff was super nice and very accommodating of every request providing me with good information when i needed and just generally being so nice and friendly i had a few chances to eat meals in the hotel other than breakfast and it was very nice the food was great and they had a nice selection of wines moreover the cafe staff as well was very nice and welcoming location is another plus it s in the old town and a few minutes walk from all the major attractions such as stephan s dome etc if i come to vienna again i ll definitely want to stay in this hotel
