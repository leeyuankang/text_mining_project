hotel was lovely we had a great stay at the melia sky the hotel is further out but it s a quick walk to the metro poble nou and cabs cost around to the centre in the summer season i bet it s a perfect location for the beach and using the pool facilities etc the staff were friendly and accommodating it was my partners birthday whilst we were away and the hotel brought us a bottle of cava and a gorgeous chocolate cake to celebrate which i hadn t asked for so was a thoughtful touch bed was comfortable and the big windows and view were lovely overall really happy with our stay and barcelona was as beautiful as always
