we stayed at bilderberg gardens with a couple of friends the hotel is a five star hotel and it really is unless you dare to have a deeper look e g the air condtionsystem started making strange noises from time to time the bar closed every day around maybe thats critisism on high level but the free wifi was the worst i have ever experienced i am quite sure we are not the target audience for such a hotel but the price was good and the tram station lines and was just a few minute walk away
