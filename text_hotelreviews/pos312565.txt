the entire place has a luxury business atmosphere me and my partner were amazed by how nice this place was about a minute walk construction at the time may be less is a wonderful park called vondel park close to museums and there are many nice cafes and restaurants near by we mainly just used google maps to get around would recommend that too the hotel may be out of the city center but it is in a very wealthy and clean area and it is lovely to just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere
