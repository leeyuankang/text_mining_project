clean room comfortable bed we very much appreciated the turn down service and free mini bar in our room staff was very helpful and immediately tended to our need when we had trouble setting the climate control in our room the location was nice and quiet in a residential part of town and enabled us to relax after the bustle of downtown public transportation was convenient and easy to navigate restaurant food was amazing
