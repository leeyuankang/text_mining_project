the rooms were comfortable and spacious which made a long day sightseeing better in the knowledge you could get back to the hotel and relax the staff also added nice little touches to the stay like turning your radio on to classical music while you were out to give you a nice welcome back hotel located just from the sights of the city easy to walk to all locations
