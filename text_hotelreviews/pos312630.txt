location is excellent in the very civilised oud zuid old south district easy to reach business district of the zuidas but only minutes walk to museumplein and the pc hoofstraat hotel is unflashy but competent and comfortable it s kind of style but has all mod cons and works very well friendly and helpful staff the restaurant is a good one and attracts plenty of custom from outside the hotel although it is expensive not much on the plate and a lot on the bill
