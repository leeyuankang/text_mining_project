good location nice and quite area about min to city centre by public transport lost of cafes and restaurants nearby the room is average looking but you get a really good night sleep since the bed and pillows are excellent little things like robes and branded toiletries made the misses really happy considering amsterdam is rather expensive in terms of accommodation if you manage to get a good discount deal close to gbp per night you are getting good value for money
