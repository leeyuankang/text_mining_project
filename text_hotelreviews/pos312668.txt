the staff were so friendly and helpful even providing us with unberellas as we walked out of the door one wet night nothing was too much trouble breakfast was superb and felt a very intimate setting despite being a large hotel location was fantastic easy walk to centre of the city whilst being quiet and very classy felt like being in knightsbridge
