the front desk staff were extra helpful with respect to early check in we arrived from the airport about hours early and our bill remained the same as when we booked we were directed to the breakfast buffet even this price was adjusted downward by euros each per day of our stay and enjoyed a very good buffet the room was very comfortable my first trip back to the netherlands in years and things were taken care of very well by the staff which made for a very nice homecoming
