as a young couple keen to explore we loved how easy it was to get into the main city of amsterdam and surrounding buzzing surburbs from the hotel location just a short leisurely minute walk to the tram with an minute journey into the city to the surrounding buzz and to the museum district or so minute walk what s better the beer garden at the hotel was a lovely place to enjoy a morning cup of tea or nice evening drink
