the room was a very good size and very comfortable and the service staff friendly and thorough reception staff and porters were extremely helpful and welcoming and there was a very pleasant lounge bar with a friendly barman the breakfasts were very good and i thought value for money the location which was in a pleasant area was about a half hour tram journey from the old town but only about a minute walk from the museum quarter which suited me there were also several nice restaurants within walking distance i shall certainly stay there again
