the hotel is in a very nice neighborhood with quiet streets all around there are some nice parks close by and good restaurants within walking distance it s far from the hustle and bustle of the city center but there are tram lines within a minute walk that will take you there in min or less so it was definitely a very good location the staff at the front desk was always very pleasant and attentive going above and beyond to help you with all your needs
