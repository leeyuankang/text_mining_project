excellent hotel very clean and comfortable we stayed in an executive room and it was lovely the reception staff were most helpful as was the restaurant staff though we only had breakfast which was delicious if we were going back to amsterdam we would definitely stay here because of the above and because it is not far by tram to get where you want to be tram is the mode of transport to take taxis take much longer because of the circuitous route they have to take
