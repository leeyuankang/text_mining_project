i traveled with my husband and year old it was an excellent place to stay for days very comfortable clean quiet and staff at reception very helpful the suite was cleaned everyday and the staff responded to our requests promptly the location was close to the catalunya square many bakery cafe restaurants closeby will recommend to friends and stay again
