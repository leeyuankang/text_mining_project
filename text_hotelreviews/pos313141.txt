the room was very nice the layout was good clean and comfortable the staff were very helpful and happy to assist with any of our requests the view from the roof top was amazing and gave you a different perspective of barcelona the location of the hotel was quiet but was within walking distance of local shopping a great bakery the metro the touristic bus and much more there was a laundry right next door
