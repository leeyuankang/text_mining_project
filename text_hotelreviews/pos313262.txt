the location is great very close to the airbus stop and the metro la rambla is just meters from the entrance we booked a room with terrace on the highest floor which was nice the terrace is big and had a table with two chairs and one sun bed since we stayed on the floor we had sun on the terrace most of the day bed was comfortable they had a pillow menu but we didn t see that until the last day so we missed out the opportunity to choose pillows i wish they would have told us about the pillow menu when checking in the pillows we got was not bad so it was ok breakfast was really priceworthy a lot to choose from both hot and cold espresso machine personal was friendly fast elevator the wi if was fast and stable not something you can take for granted when staying at hotels but this wi if was great
