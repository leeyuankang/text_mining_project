great location in the city center just a stone s throw away from the tourist hotspots of placa da catalunya and la ramblas we were able to walk around to almost all important destinations a taxi to sagrada familia cost us under eur the hotel has a large lobby where guests can wait and have a free welcome drink private parking is a blessing in this busy area the rooms are comfortable and clean the front desk esp alvarez and jorge won us over with their special service we arrived early so they kept our luggage for the best part of the day while we toured the city we had booked one room with terrace and they upgraded the other to a terrace room for free it doesn t end here they waived the full parking fee of eur and even let us use the parking for several hours after we checked out and on our request they also called up a eurostars hotel in valencia and got us the best deal i m definitely coming back
