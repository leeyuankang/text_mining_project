great location helpful staff nor always around when you needed them though hotel details talked about a restaurant and snack bar but in my night midweek stay i didn t see either of these open or being used by anyone but there was no need for them there is such a huge number of other options a simple few steps away the hotel is literally mins from plaza de las catalunya and the mega shopping paradise of las ramblas breakfast buffet was amazing
