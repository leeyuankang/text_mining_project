excellent position for much of interest in barcelona very quiet in room we were on the top floor with a large terrace with sun loungers and a table which we could have used more if we had stayed longer than nights the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in the parking was one of the reasons we booked the hotel which was good as there were few cars in it i have a large car so no need to worry about access although the entrance exit is steep but you have to expect that we did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were plenty of little cafes where you could eat more cheaply
