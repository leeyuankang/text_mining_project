perfect location minute walk from pla a de catalunya which is the main square situated pretty much on la rambles so close to restaurants shops bars about minutes walk to the port and also la sagrada familiar staff were welcoming and very helpful the rooms were big airy and comfortable and came equipped with a power shower and bath even though it is very central very quiet in the hotel at night to catch some much needed sleep pla a de catalunya is a main stop for the aerobus euros single a lot cheaper than taxis as well the open bus tours personally i preferred the metro to the open bus tours as it was much quicker cheaper however if you want the experience of a guide telling you background to the attractions etc it is worth it overall great location staff and clean would stay here again
