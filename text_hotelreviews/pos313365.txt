brilliant location minutes from place catalunya where airport bus and tour buses all terminate between paseig de gracia and ramblas de catalunya so extensive shopping facilities and eating options on doorstep we had very little interaction with the staff but they seemed pleasant no need to book breakfast as endless caf s around dining area looked functional and uninspiring anyway
