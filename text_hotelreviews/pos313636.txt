they very kindly had our room ready when we arrived at am a real rarity the room was very spacious for a city hotel room and faced away from the street making it very quiet which we had requested everything was very clean and they even provided a little vial of lavendar scented pillow spray we have stayed in barca several times and this is by far the best location walking distance to everything and a great tapas place tapas across the street staff were also friendly though we didn t interact with them much we would definitely choose this hotel again our rate was night which we consider fair for this city
