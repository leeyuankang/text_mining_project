i loved the fact that you had a family style room i was traveling with my sisters and i was happy that we all got to stay in one room adults staying in bunkbeds was unexpected but we are small and agile so it worked just fine the beds were super comfortable we are not coffee drinkers so we can t rate the coffee our overall stay was superb i would recommend it to others and i would stay there again
