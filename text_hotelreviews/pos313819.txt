the staff were lovely greeting us each time we arrived or left the room was spacious and facilities excellent the hotel is well maintained and clean breakfast buffet had an extensive choice and plenty of time the hotel is only two minutes away from placa catalunya at the top of the ramblas making it very central we had a lovely stay and will return to the petit palace museum hotel very soon
