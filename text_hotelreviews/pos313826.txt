staff was helpful informative our luggage did not arrive for days and they did all the follow up calls for us so we could just get on with our plans worry free we would go back in a heartbeat we had a street side room that comments said would be noisy but we found it to be fine and enjoyed watching the people on the street the location was great for walking to most tourist sites
