the locaton of the hotel is really good a block away from train metro and at the top of la rambla we were in room which is at the front and overlooks the street with a small balcony we had no noise problems from the street as the double glazing is superb the aircon is good and not too noisy bed was good comfortable great pillows the bathroom is good spacious and moden breakfast offers a good choice though the setting is a little soulless and they need a better more coffee machine for the demand the hotel and staff look the part staff obliging with a smile if asked for help thus is very much a hotel that in the morning you get up and go at night come back and crash it is not for lounging around in over drinks or an dvening meal there is room service but no restaurant or proper bar but look you are in barcelona so why would you want to stay in the hotel with this glorious city on your doorstep
