fabulous location walking distance from placa de catalunya and casa battlo passeig de gracia you can rent bikes which is a plus because barcelona is very bike friendly we had a very good price and it was enough to cover the value we received very attentive with how they treat guests the staff is very good we could store luggage before check in a big plus design was modern but worn out power shower is great
