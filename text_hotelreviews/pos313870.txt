the location was brilliant slightly out of the buzz but that is what we liked as it was only a short walk we asked for a room at the back of the hotel so as it was more quiet and they accepted our request what can we say about the shower bathroom apart from luxury the shower was big enough for about people the staff were very helpful and told us the directions to the main tourist places absolutely fantastic hotel would definitely come back
