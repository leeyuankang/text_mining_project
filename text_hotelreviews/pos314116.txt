was a wonderful hotel in a perfection location for me roughly minute walk into central and also had a free shuttle bus service to and from the centre was great value for money and the staff couldn t do enough for us i emailed asking if we could check in early due to an early flight unfortunately there wasn t a room ready but the staff went above and beyond to ensure the safety of our luggage so that we could go and explore this beautiful city i would highly recommend and i will definitely be booking again next year
