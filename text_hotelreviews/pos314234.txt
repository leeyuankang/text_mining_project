the hotel is an easy metro ride from the centre and is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood so no night time noise there are interesting tourist sites nearby if a change of pace is needed from the crowds in the city centre we were in a spacious attic room with a superb bathroom with views to the norman foster communications tower and the parc tibidabo from the shower there was an outside seating area on the roof for the attic rooms as well as a small garden downstairs where meals can be taken we didn t use the pool area but it looked a great place to relax on warmer days the staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent we loved the comfy lounge with honesty bar where we made our own gin and tonics before heading out to eat free coffee is available all day in the library computer room it is well worth being outside the city centre to stay at this quirky hotel
