the hotel is great we stayed only for one night but we would have stayed more if we could the hotel staff were very professional and we had free access to any nonalcoholic beverages trough the hole day and complementary minibar as well it is a very chic and clean hotel it was a bit far from barcelona center but we drove by car and it was no problem i definitely recommend it
