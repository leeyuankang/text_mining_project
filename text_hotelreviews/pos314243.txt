we stayed for one week this hotel was a perfect match for us transport and location the hotel is outside crowded tourist areas but within walking distance from different metro train stations sarria lines metro and les tres torres there is also a stop of the trourist hop on hop off bus nearby the surrounding area is quiet especially quiet at night comfortable and green nice to walk around in the evening the area around sarria station is very nice with low rise buildings there are several restaurants cafes in the walking distance from the hotel and a hair studio just opposite the hotel i did not visit the salon but after all it is nice to have the opportunity interriors the hotel has charming interriors reception area lobby bar area decorated with good sense of style our room was spacious and had everything needed wooden furniture particular items appear vintage which is appealing to me nothing like plastic ikea style items the beds were comfortable no complains as to the sound proofing in the room no noise from the outside or from the corridor wi fi internet connection was stable and reliable the hotel staff were very helpful
