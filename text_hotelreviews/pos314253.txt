the ambiance and service were outstanding from our reception to our departure the bar lounge was very relaxing and inviting the breakfast area was very accommodating and selections were plentiful and delicious we will return to this lovely hotel when next in barcelona our room was on the top floor and the decor was really special with the beamed ceilings and old brick walls tastefully combined with new modern fixtures
