the rooms were really nice and the beds were comfortable we were fortunate to have rooms at the back of the hotel so had a nice view of the city and the beach the location was very quiet and only a minute walk to the beach we were a little concerned about how far away we were from everything but the most we walked was for an hour all the way from mount tibidabo if we wanted to order a taxi most of the reception staff were more than happy to order one for you breakfast was good too their tea in particular was lovely typical brit missing good tea you won t miss it at breakfast the rooms and bathroom were very spacious with all the usual amenities very happy
