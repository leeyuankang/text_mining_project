we arrived after a flight from australia and were treated exceptionally well by the staff we booked a level room which is large super comfortable great views of the city and river and the bathroom is fabulous rooms are very quiet because of the carpets in the hallways we had access to the club lounge on level with amazing views good food and great service no complaints here
