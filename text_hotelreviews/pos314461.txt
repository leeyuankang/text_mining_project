it s a very glamorous hotel so you do feel like a rockstar knowing that you are staying in the tallest building in the city the beds are very comfy and i really like that there was enough space in the room and bath room outside the room there is ample space to chill out on different floors wehad the xmas brunch which was phenomenal and the upstairs bar really makes the best cocktails i have ever tasted the staff are multilingual a lot of them speak atleast different languages which is awesome
