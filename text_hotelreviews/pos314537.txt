the hotel is in the highest skyscraper in austria but the rooms are only by floor so if you want to see the sky from the window the only chance is to go to floor to the lounge good cocktails for eur or to the restaurant but in restaurant you should book a table in advance as it is fancy and has dc room design is nice veeery comfortable bed mini bar is for free without alcohol staff on reception is ok but a bit snobby the guys at room service and in the lounge are nice and helpful the hotel is near to metro station and it is the direct line to stephansplatz amusement park praterstern is really close too steps by metro so this is a fancy place comfortable with donau window view and beautiful terrace with the whole city view
