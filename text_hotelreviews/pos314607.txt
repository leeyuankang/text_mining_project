the room was great excellent value considering we got a double deluxe in a deal it was hugely spacious luxury sexy interior and a huge amazingly comfortable bed with floor to ceiling windows that meant you could look out over the city the mini bar was also complementary and all the staff were very helpful not that we needed much help i was a bit wary of how far away from the centre of vienna it would be but it was absolutely not an issue the trains are so simple to co ordinate and you are a minute walk from the nearest station just a few minutes from town we did visit the bar at the end of our saturday night which had great cocktails and was quite busy with music and a bar club feel i would undoubtedly recommend this hotel it delivers what it says and is a little bit of luxury for excellent value in a beautiful city
