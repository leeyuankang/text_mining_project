the room was very comfortable it was cold during our trip and it was nice to have the bathroom floor heated the beds are of comfortable size and are very comfortable the pillows are nice as well the minibar is refilled daily with compliments and there is also a coffee machine which is really a plus for those who cant start the day with a nice cup of coffee
