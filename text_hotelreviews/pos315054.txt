the staff really went beyond to help us on the day we arrived i lost my credit card in the metro ticket machine at the airport after many phone calls put in to tmb by the staff of this hotel we were able to recover the lost card they also moved us to a different room after we had disturbed sleep due to noisy guests and for the final night upgraded us to a triple room and gave us a free breakfast
