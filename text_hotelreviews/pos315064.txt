the hotel was in the most perfect location close to the harbour and las ramblas but was also away from the noise the room was really clean and big even though we were three people in one room it also had a large bathroom the spare bed was a proper bed and not your usual pull out bed the staff were very friendly and helpful would definitely recommend people to stay here
