the balcony was beautiful you could see the whole city that s pretty much what your paying for the room was well decorated equipped the same goes for the bathroom overall the room had a good layout and had a nice ambiance however it was nothing spectacular the location on the otherhand is great close to nice bars restaurants and not that far from the city tram lines are also close and the breakfast was decent
