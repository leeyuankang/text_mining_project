view from penthouse terrace was great nice little fridge in room wet room soaker shower and decent toiletries in bathroom very very quiet hotel and location only a minutes walk from main bus and tram stops though these aren t always necessary though as the park and museums are only a minute walk away and in the other direction the old town is only minutes walk away a walk that takes you along countless canals and bridges my room itself had a canal view the canal being from the hotel
