we have stayed here in the past and we like the layout of the hotel it feels like you are staying in your own apartment rather than a hotel although the staff are always on hand if you should need them the hotel is in a great location minutes stroll of leidseplein the museums and the great shops on the streets all in all its a great little hotel
