my room was a nice penthouse not big not tiny either it included a roof deck with furnishings a great view the weather wasn t nice enough to enjoy the deck but that isn t their fault the neighborhood is peaceful elegant about a minute walk to the center the wlan is fast free parking was ok i guess breakfast was you must reserve parking
