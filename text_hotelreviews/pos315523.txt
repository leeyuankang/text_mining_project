mum teen daughter trip the hotel is a little different being in an apartment block but it s pretty cool having glass walkways between areas rooms were modern clean comfortable cool glass bathrooms robes and free beer juice in the minibar also a good coffee machine with various teas too staff really friendly allowed us to leave our bags when we checked out so we could tour unhindered until our taxi great area too their breakfast looked lovely but we went to nearby mook pankakes instead also the food hall is nearby again lovely food you feel more like you are getting a feel for real amsterdam staying here rather than right in the centre but still close enough to walk to everything museums canal trips streets a must if you are female into shopping at all a little research on the area is needed as there s some great places nearby
