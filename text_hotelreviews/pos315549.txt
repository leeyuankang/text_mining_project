the room was clean and modern and better than other places we have stayed at in amsterdam that were actually more expensive so it is great value for money location is nice the area has lots of really nice pleased to eat and drink that are not over ran by tourists and is easy walking distracted to most things you want to visit staff were very nice and helpful we also loved the little touch of free mini bar this is a lovely touch and more hotels should do this i would stay here again
