it was an amazing experience to stay here although it was only for a night it might seem a bit expensive but actually amsterdam is pretty expensive in general the service was amazing even the chek in was a really great feeling very friendly and supportive the mini bar was for free i will come back since it was a business trip and we have a office in amsterdam i also recommended it to all of my colleagues
