the location was excellent so close to all major tram lines into city and airport it didn t feel like a hotel but more of apartments which made it feel more private staff were also brilliant in helping me arrange a valentines surprise for my boyfriend and complimentary drinks restocked every day in mini fridge in room was a bonus
