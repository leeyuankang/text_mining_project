this was our first stay in amsterdam and it was quite a bit to take in attempting to get to the hotel from centraal station but it turns out there is a tram stop right near the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and we actually got upgraded to a junior suite free of charge there is also a free mini bar and a safe as well as a coffee machine in the room transport links are very close by but we found it easier to walk around amsterdam the hotel is approx mins walk from dam the centre of the city overall it is a very reasonably priced hotel for the accommodation we had and we would definitely stay again
