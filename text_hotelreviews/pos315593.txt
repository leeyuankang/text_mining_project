the staff at amadi park are very friendly the location is excellent a minute walk from leidseplein the hotel is best accessed from the airport by the bus from stop alight at leidseplein this is not so much a hotel but a small flat were you can come and go as you please there is no kitchen though there is a nespresso machine however but securing the coffee pods can be a struggle
