i travelled solo for nights and stayed in a single room though the size of the rrom was small it was clean and the bed was comfortable the bathrroms were clean too staff was also friendly and on my lastnight they helped me out with the easiest and most economical mode of transport to the airport the only thing i did not like was that in the price they charged breakfast wasnt included i had to pay euros extra for breakfast after charging euros per night and u realize that u have to shell out extra for breakfast dint go well with me overall it was a nice experience the place is easily accessible there is a tram stop nearby which helps u reach dam square and centraal in mins vondelpark is mins walking so if u feel like going for an early morning walk its easy to reach there would recomend my others to stay at this hotel and for my next visit would again love to stay here
