the place is very central in amsterdam west which is a hip neighborhood of the city with a lot of restaurants and is easy to get to the rooms are clean and spacious by amsterdam standards and the bed was very comfortable there s ensuite toilet and shower with towel and shampoo provided if you re there for museums then this is also a great place to stay because vondelpark and museumplein are literally a stone throw away
