the staff was very friendly and the hotel itself very nice the room was perfect for two the minibar was for free and it was clean it s a minute walk to the next tram that goes directly into the center of amsterdam and there are cute restaurants and breakfast places right next to it there was always someone at the reception if we had questions although the room was looking right towards a street it was quiet enough and you couldn t hear any noises from the other rooms i would definitely recommend the hotel
