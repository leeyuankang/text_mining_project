having been to amsterdam several times this was a perfect choice we wanted to stay somewhere that was a little more comfortable that a grungy hotel but at a reasonable price the location is the best part we ate almost ever meal within a few blocks of the hotel and had breakfast every morning for an extra euro each some may say it is overpriced but it is buffet style with many options eggs bacon meat selection cheese selection yogurt granola fresh squeezed orange juice and quite the assortment of dutch breads you are paying for the convenience many people complained on this site that the hotel is part of a larger complex of apartments and businesses but i found i enjoyed this aspect because i felt more like i was at home the hotel lobby is on the floor and the rooms were on the floor we had no problems with maid service and they have a free mini bar in the room and unlimited high quality water in the lobby there is a great bike rental place just a block away and i recommend this mode of transportation around amsterdam museums are an easy walk and leiseplein my favorite square is only minute walk from the hotel from there you can easily hop on a tram to and from central amsterdam or catch a bus to and from the airport
