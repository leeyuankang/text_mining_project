this was our second stat at this property the hotel is extremely well located within walking distance to many attractions they offer an excellent breakfast and around the clock drinks and snacks the honor bar on the roof offers a relaxing interlude we had one of the rooms with a bonus sitting room across the hall this type of room is excellent for couples that keep different sleeping hours i think this is the best choice in barcelona
