from the convenient location which is close to the ramblas and not a far walk from the ocean either the hotel has a lot to offer the interiors are simple and sophisticated the staff are friendly and courteous speaking in multiple languages including french english and of course spanish we also thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and sitting to enjoy a drink on the rooftop terrace
