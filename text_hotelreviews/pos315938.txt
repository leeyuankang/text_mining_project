wonderful hotel our corner room was very spacious and had a large bathroom with separate tub and shower great location just off the rambla near plaza catalunya we had stayed at casa camper in berlin so we were prepared for the cantina for breakfast and other goodies the rooftop honor bar was a great place to unwind after a day of touring the staff is very friendly and helpful the hotel made our visit to barcelona unforgettable
