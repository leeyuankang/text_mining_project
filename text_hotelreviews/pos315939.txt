the pillows and sheets were amazing i took pictures of the tags to see if i can buy them the snack bar is great we arrived in midday and took the airport shuttle to the universidad stop which was an easy min walk to the hotel we were hungry and tired when we got in and just wanted to sit for a few minutes the snack bar provided complimentary sandwiches snacks and water soda also the included breakfast was great eggs made to order got a veggie omelette one day and eggs with breakfast sausage the next and lots of pastries and other continental breakfast items the rooftop lounge was great including the honor bar the basement bar with pool tables had incredible and strong cocktails but above all else we loved the neighborhood we explorer every alley we could find and tried to eat a few tapas and have a drink at several places each night there were upscale options casual eateries and bars with beers all day in the college area we spent every night of our night stay exploring our neighborhood we saw other areas during the day but always wanted to stay around the hotel in the evening cause we loved it so much also super close to catalunya the main plaza where the buses pick up and at the top of la rambla the most famous street very convenient for being touristy but in a neighborhood that makes you really want to not be touristy as i m sure you can tell we loved this place i have no complaints
