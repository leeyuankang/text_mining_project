good happy staff clean and comfortable hotel location is within a minute walk of pl de catalunya where the airport shuttle comes in any help with orientation bookings etc all dealt with superbly carter was particularly good so special mention but all the staff were good the food snacks available after breakfast and all day long were of good quality and a great idea the roof terrace still gets a little ambience from the street below plus a great view over the rooftops a handy and relaxing place to chill for half an hour or more particularly with the honesty bar being available
