design of room as well as extremely helpful staff who obviously enjoy their job room efficient not cluttered great natural light privacy even at night as no need to pull shades also separate room across hall with couch hammock for relaxing if other person wants to sleep breakfast was prepared presented with same attention personalization as other services didn t use exercise room as enough exercise walking riding bikes available at hotel highly recommend for those who also value above amenities
