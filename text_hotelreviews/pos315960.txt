i called ahead and asked about parking i was directed to a lot very close to the hotel which i found easily but my gps was having trouble giving me walking directions from there i called again and the gentleman who answered went outside found me several blocks away and escorted me back to the hotel now that s service it was late and i really appreciated the complimentary food and drink in the lobby the room layout with its separate living space is one of my favorite features great people watching from the french doors to the street below and yet the bedroom is quiet and private lovely rooftop bar too
