super friendly and helpful staff truly warm and kind excellent location for my work but also super convenient for a bit of added tourism and shopping if you had the time a very unique concept though would recommend it more for leisure tourism than for a business trip the all day self service cafe was a great concept the honesty bar is such a great idea and nice views from there too
