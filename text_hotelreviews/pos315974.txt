the staff make you feel welcome all the time not just on arrival the best introduction to facilities available was given to me on arrival very comfy bed and amazing pillows food and drink availability set up is great imho raises the bar forgive the expression for other hotels extra room for blobbing out private lounge opposite bedroom a plus and also has a hammock ideally situated centrally in this extremely cultural historic and relaxed city what is not to like by the way posts i read about taxi drivers charging above rate fares proved to be incorrect
