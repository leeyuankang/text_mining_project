this was the location where we splurged on accommodation the casa camper is well located a block from the ramblas and plaza catalunya it is a unique boutique hotel with modern facilities but also lots of charm our room was quiet looking over the inner courtyard which gave total privacy the amenities are first class including an all day food service staff were superb and friendly very helpful on how to get to key sites etc responsive to all our needs excellent security
