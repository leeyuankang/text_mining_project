the beds were very comfortable and the sheets super soft the breakfasts were made to order fresh and flavorful the availability of food in the area near the reception desk made it very welcoming for all guests great place to relax after being out all day touring or to recharge before the next adventure and the location was perfect close to two metro stations and walking distance to most sites
