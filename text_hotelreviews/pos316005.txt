this was our favourite hotel in spain firstly the service was exceptional the front desk staff bent over backwards to help in any way the room was spotlessly clean chic and well appointed we enjoyed the separate room with the hammock couch and balcony we saw the value in the separate room in that the bedroom was very quiet yet you could enjoy the street scene from the bonus room the all day evening tapas was excellent as was the made to order breakfast the rooftop terrace was a beautiful relaxing spot in a busy city the location was perfect a very short walk to las ramblas we would definitely stay there again we had read the reviews and were not disappointed it is a modern chic boutique style hotel
