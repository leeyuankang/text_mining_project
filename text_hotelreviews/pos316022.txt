really cool hotel but unlike other cool places i ve stated this place lives to serve their guests never stayed at a hotel where i ve felt more welcome from the welcoming orientation to the neighborhood sand barcelona to dealing with everyday travelers needs like a taxi to the airport or checking in early we were treated wonderfully great breakfast with made to order eggs etc a wonderful bar and bartender in the basement and a great rooftop patio i love this place
