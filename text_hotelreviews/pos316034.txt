they just get it right at hotel casa camper the open kitchen of snacks and drinks all afternoon evening is such a nice touch after coming back from a day of sightseeing the staff were incredibly helpful with suggestions for what to see in the city and restaurant recommendations and there are lots of hooks in the room to hang towels clothes bags etc
