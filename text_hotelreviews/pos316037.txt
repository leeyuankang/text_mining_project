the staff are wonderful so helpful attentive and very knowledgeable about the local area the rooms are fantastic and the separate lounge facilities especially the hammock is a genius idea breakfast is delicious and the terrace on the top floor is a great addition even in the winter sunshine it was a welcome place to rest and recharge on the rooftop you can even see columbus from the terrace toilet window we will be back thank you
