great location with many attractions within walking distance lots of restaurants and pubs close by we had a lovely large room and bathroom with separate loo the staff were excellent all of them lovely plentiful breakfasts and free snacks available during the rest of the day and evening i loved their trust system in the bar on the roof this was also a great spot to just chill
