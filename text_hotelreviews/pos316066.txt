the staff were friendly and the service was wonderful nothing was to much trouble the rooms were well equipped and the shower wet room was fantastic with lovely toiletries beds were very comfortable and long enough as my husband is very tall the all day buffett was very welcome with a good variety we didnt use the lounge room across the corridor as we were busy sight seeing but this is ideal for a family with children who need their own space
