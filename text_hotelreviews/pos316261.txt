we stayed at holiday inn wembley because we were going to an event a the stadium and wanted to be close by we paid a high rate for the room because it was an event day we were very pleased with our room on the floor the view may have been a problem to some people as it over looked the building site next door but there was no noise and we weren t in the room very much the only issue we had was some old uht milk in with the tea and coffee facilities the staff on reception were very helpful with this issue and agreed to allow us to receive free parking as compensation all in all a very good stay and nice hotel
