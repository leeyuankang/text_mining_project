everything went fine we have a blind daughter and we got an early check in because they were going to a concert at wembley stadium from to hrs the staff were very helpful and polite and could not do enough for us our daughter is years old and blind so getting the room early was first class and allowed us to relax in the bar before going to the concert i would stay there again since its ideal for wembley stadium or wembley ssi overall its was fine but the water incident was a major problem see comments below
