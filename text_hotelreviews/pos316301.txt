the breakfast was very good even though we got down there at just before they still accommodated us and our friends didn t get down till after and still managed to get breakfast the bed was so soft with firm pillows made for a perfect nights sleep and the location was perfect we managed to go to the london designer outlet and have a browse and when i noticed my shirt was dirty it took me about a minute walk to get to it to buy myself a new one all in all the hotel was very good the pool is brilliant very big nice jacuzzi and staff are very helpful very good value for money in addition the tube and train station are only a short walk away meaning our night out in london was very accessible and when it came to going home we were right next to the station
