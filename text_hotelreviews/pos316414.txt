we got a good value price for this well situated hotel ample parking if tight health club facilities gym pool steam room sauna the reception area and bar are in good order rooms were nice clean and modern decoration decent wifi we were using it as a base for a night out to see a show so we saved heaps compared to a city centre hotel and just jumped on the tube to central london the outlet retain centre is next to the hotel with a good range of shops and restaurants waggamama and nandos were good
