when they told me i was in a studio i thought i would be cramped in a tiny box but the room was quite spacious with a stove fridge and even a dish washer it has everything to make you feel at home the staff were really friendly and helpful they also have a free laundry room and gym which is really convenient the weekend breakfast meal was the best i love that they have a variety of different foods and drinks
