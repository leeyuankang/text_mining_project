the bed was super comfy the shower monsoon in room on first floor was very impressive by far the best hotel we ve stayed in out of the usual chain of hotels the standard was excellent and for a trip to wembley we couldn t have been in a more perfect location the lady that checked us in and out same lady was superb and dealt with a room change because of my fear of lifts hassle free would recommend to anyone that s going to wembley
