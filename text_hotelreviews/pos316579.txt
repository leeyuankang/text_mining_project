very good value for money staff were very helpful polite and accomodating all round especially when we arrived earlier than the book in time and they got us a room as we had been travelling from very early morning with two young children breakfasts were lovely with plenty of options available and kept well stocked also situated right beside a huge outlet mall with plenty of shops and a playground kids loved the pool too stones throw from the stadium if you were going to a concert or game
