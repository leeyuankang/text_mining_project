the location was perfect for our purposes as we needed to stay near mile end but the public transport connections are quite good and there s a direct tube line to center of london too the suite was spacious clean and quiet with a comfortable bed very clean bathroom and well equipped kitchen breakfast is included in the price very friendly and helpful staff
