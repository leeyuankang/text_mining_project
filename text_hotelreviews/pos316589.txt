location is good easy access to london marylebone in mins with the train station literally on the door step right next to london designer outlet good discounted shopping and many options for dinner after a long day of sightseeing pool is adequate with a jacuzzi steam and sauna and a toddler pool rooms come with standard facilities you would expect good mix of continental and english breakfast although limited options
