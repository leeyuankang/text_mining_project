lovely big comfortable bed in quiet room floor good breakfast lots of choices enjoyed the buffet supper lots of courses and choices which was great value compared to other hotels i have stayed in more hot vegetarian options would have been welcome but there were plenty of vege options on the cold table friendly and helpful restaurant and reception staff joined the ihg rewards club so elligible for check out which made our stay very relaxing as we used our room the pool and the bar during the day before an event starting until
