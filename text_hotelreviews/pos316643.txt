the location was good it was per night and we booked a double room for a birthday night as we were going to wembley we booked the room months in advance but on arrival had a twin room the reason being because they were fully booked staff said telephone did not work in our room so had to get up and dressed to order room service but then the food we ordered was out of stock anyway overall there are much nicer places to stay in london for the same price if you don t need to be close to wembley
