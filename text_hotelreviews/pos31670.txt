the stay was brilliant more than what we had hoped for in the room all facilities were in great condition and kept very clean we were particularly impressed with the facilities of the kitchenette breakfast was brilliant when booking a room with a complimentary breakfast you are not always sure if you ll get more than just a cup of tea but your surpassed our expectations the variety and quality of breakfast items created a perfect way to start the day i would definitely recommend the staybridge suites to anyone
