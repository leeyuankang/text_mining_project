room was comfy as was the bed the breakfast was lovely ideal location for wembley stadium only a mins walk to the stadium we walked from wembley central station took about mins but you could get a train to wembley park station which is next door to the hotel this meant changing trains as we came from euston station so a short walk was no problem the hotel is ideally situated next to the retail park which is great for shopping and also has numerous eating places
