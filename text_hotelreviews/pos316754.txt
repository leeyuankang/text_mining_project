staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was very good plenty of choice and all good coffee was nice and strong just as we like it and staff were always on hand with plenty of refills room was very comfortable and very quiet we were not disturbed by other guests at all there was complimentary water in room on arrival as well as tea and coffee tray one feature that we particularly liked was that the mini bar was left empty which meant that we could use it as a fridge it would have been stocked for us if requested excellent idea
