lovely hotel and staff very comfortable and easy access to everything in the restaurant plenty of restaurants and shops close by as well we had breakfast included in our booking stay and there was plenty of options to choose from and eat as much as you want parking for our day stay which is excellent considering the other big named hotels charge around london designer outlet right next door so good if you fancy doing a bit of shopping i would def recommend this place if your looking for something reasonably priced and comfort thank you guys at the holiday inn
