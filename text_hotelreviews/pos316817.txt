the main bed was very comfy and everything was very clean staff were very friendly and helpful the breakfast was delicious but a bit expensive as people don t usually go up to fill up enough times to make it worth the i was stuffed after the one plateful i had and would have rather paid less knowing i wasn t going to be having bread or cereals
