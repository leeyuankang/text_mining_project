location close to tube station good breakfast good size room helpful staff close to restaurants and designer outlet just across the road wembley stadium also few minutes away too could see designer outlet from our room and the stadium has its own car park cost a night think it s more expensive when there are football matches on at wembley free wifi would recommend this hotel also not too expensive we were very happy with our stay
