lovely suite well equipped comfortable and quiet yet with all the buzz of westfield below cheap parking for london would recommend efficient air conditioning made the apartment very comfortable on a very hot weekend we will definitely use again had to ask for a room with a view rather than look at the air conditioning units for the retail park but once moved we could see for miles
