first of all my friend and i arrived to check in however we came earlier than the staff were amazingly friendly and was able to help us with the check in and went out of their way to supply a room that was ready for us to go to i loved the rooms they were very clean and had a lovely view of london also the breakfast in the morning had a variety of every food possible so spoilt for choice
