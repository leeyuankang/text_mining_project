very friendly staff comfortable quiet room with well equipped kitchen this was particularly useful as i was staying on my own and eating out alone isn t particularly enjoyable excellent breakfast good transport links to central london every shop you could need on your doorstep i had to travel by car and was able to park in the westfield car park below the hotel for a day on weekdays a bargain for london would highly recommend to anyone who doesn t need to stay in central london
