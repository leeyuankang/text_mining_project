the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and spacious larger than the average uk chain hotel there was a mini bar which kept some of our supplies cool if you stay more than one night there is an option not to have the room cleaned and to claim a free drink each at the bar instead there was a lovely terrace and grassed outdoor seating area in which to have said drink almost opposite was a billa supermarket which was well presented and had a lovely choice of food and drink an aldi was also located about metres in the opposite direction the location was also just a few minutes walk from the underground station and also convenient for the danube waterfront the hotel room brochure recommended a place to eat which although we were dubious about trying was really good it was about a minute walk but worth it for a very authentic pub bar with reasonably priced food and the option for eating inside or out
