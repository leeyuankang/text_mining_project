i think the price value ratio is really good with this hotel even if we were charged an extra euro for the parking the flat was brand new and nice and the hotel was close to the stadium which was really important for us there are supermarket pharmacy public transport restaurant etc nearby the staff was really helpful and i loved that the check out time was am the concert was too good to wake up early
