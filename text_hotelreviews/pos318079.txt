hour reception helpful professional personell in both reception and restaurant although not in immediate centre the holtel is only a few metro stops away from main points of interest centre railway stations ets few minutes walk from the metro station great size room my room even facing the street was still quiet comfortable beds at the time of booking good value for money ideal for solo travellers and business fine for families and couples if no romantic perks are required if needed supermarket is just opposite the hotel acceptable breakfast if included in room rate when in vienna again i ll definitely check this hotel for availability
