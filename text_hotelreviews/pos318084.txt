the room and bathroom were large and clean especially the bathroom wi fi worked great staff was helpful and in general i didn t have any complaints during my stay at the moment that i booked this hotel i couldn t find anything even close to this quality for the money the hotel is located very conveniently near to the airport train city center and vienna international center it is also very close to prater amusement park donauinsel and saint francis of assisi church
