location couldn t have been better right at the doors of the westfield shopping centre and across the road of olympic park which is where we were everyday staff couldn t do enough for you and so friendly rooms very clean and such a change from only getting a room and ensuite to a kitchen with fridge hob and dishwasher and separate lounge will defiantly stay here again when we return next year if not sooner
