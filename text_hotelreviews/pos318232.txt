i was in barcelona for a convention and booked a regular room through booking com nights euro per night without breakfast for one person and my tiny room faced an inner pier no window facing the outside world not possibility to know what the weather is like or see anything that is going on outside no way to open the curtains as the see through elevator was going down next to my room and there were other windows facing mine on all sides i think that a star hotel must have all rooms facing the outside and if the room is not this needs to be written in the room description i thought euro per night without breakfast were enough and did not take the superior room which was an additional euro per night when i saw that my room is facing a pier i asked to change the room but they said they were fully booked i want to stress that the hotel is beautiful has a good location the room was clean and nice the bathroom big and comfortable there was a nespresso coffee machine and water bottles every day complementary from the hotel but in hindsight i personally would not have chosen this hotel with this view i find that depressing sorry and the hotel must say in the room description that it faces an inner pier period
