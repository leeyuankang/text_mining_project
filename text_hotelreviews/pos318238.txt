the extra touches made it really feel like a hotel from the welcome drink cava on arrival to the nespresso machine and biscuits in our room the staff were lovely and breakfast was brilliant the food was freshly made to our order every morning it was actually totally worth the which surprised me the pool area was great and i can t wait to go again
