hotel is clean modern and comfortable staff very helpful and knowledgable great location for getting around the city metro station right around the corner from hotel too we went for my husbands birthday and there was a bottle of bubbly in the room when we arrived that was a nice touch lots of little restaurants and cafes for breakfast and lunch around hotel
