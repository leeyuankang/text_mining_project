the towels were fluffy and the shower pressure was great the business centre in the lobby had a printer so you can print train tickets etc for free wifi was fast enough for video streaming from outside i saw the bigger rooms when the doors were opened for cleaning the looked really nice and i think it would have been worth it to pay more for them if you are not staying alone the location is convenient and there is a great english language bookshop called come in just around the corner
