a very smart and attractive hotel in a good location the bed in the first room we were given was very small we asked to upgrade at reception we were willing to pay and were told there was nothing available until the next day however later on we were told there was another budget room available with a bigger bed we changed rooms at no extra cost and had a much better bed the rooms are small but well equipped lovely showers local restaurants were very good
