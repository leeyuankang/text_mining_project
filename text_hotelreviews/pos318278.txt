i have to tell the story of how wonderful the staff was when i left my iphone in the pocket of the bathrobe at the hotel i was at the train station ready to go to madrid when i discovered that i didn t have it they went to the room found it and had it at the desk for me as i dashed back by cab to retrieve it knowing that they found it and were holding it made those anxious moments a bit less stressful
