quiet part of barcelona but nice restaurants in walking distance min walk to central shopping area and sagrada familiar we had a beautiful room with terrace bed was comfy and room exceptionally clean pool was small and shallow but lovely to cool off in large variety of food for breakfast and lovely outdoor area for a quiet drink car parking underneath the building was great and easy to get into
