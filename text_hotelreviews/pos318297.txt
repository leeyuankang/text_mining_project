i loved the aesthetics of the hotel and the various areas to work or have a drink the terrace lobby and pool area the pool itself was almost laughingly small but it s mostly for looks anyways the pool area is super nice and well serviced the a la carte menus were quite reasonably priced i also appreciated the amenities of the room
