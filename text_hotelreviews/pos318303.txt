lovely hotel a little off the beaten track but then all of barcelona is nice very high class everything at your fingertips lovely toiletries everything you could need bar a little pricey i had a room with a balcony not a fabulous view but nice to sit out pool area lovely but small overall one of the nicest hotels i ve used
