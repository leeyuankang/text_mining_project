this hotel is amazing everything about it was perfect the only thing i can t comment on is the food as we are out every day but apart from that i can not fault this hotel at all staff were super friendly and so helpful we also hired some bikes from the hotel too great added facility save hunting round for someone in the tourist area and having to find them again to give them back at the end of the trip i would recommends his hotel for anyone who just wants to relax or if they are on a tourist holiday like myself it was great to come back to a freshly cleaned room and get an amazing shower i would definitely stay at this hotel again or any of the hotels around the world thankyou for your hospitality
