staff were amazing and very helpful i stayed on my own with my year old daughter as we were going to a couple of shows breakfast was very busy and i think some people were unhappy having to wait for items to be replenished but i didn t find this a problem very small thing that would have helped was a tray as we were seated quite a way from the buffet and i had to go backwards and forwards to get everything we needed room was well equipped and well soundproofed bed was very comfy too would definitely stay again
