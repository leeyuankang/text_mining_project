the studio suite was lovely and had a very well equipped kitchen it even had a dishwasher the suite was very clean the complementary breakfast was fine with a small hot selection and a larger continental breakfast selection the lounge area near reception was very comfortable and there was free coffee tea and soft drinks available we didn t go but nights a week there is a managers social evening the manager provides free alcoholic and soft drinks and snacks between which is brilliant idea for people to mingle and meet especially if you are stopping in the a suites for longer stays the staff were all helpful and friendly i would use the staybridge suites again
