i received a warm welcome and better still a free glass of champagne upon arrival the hotel was clean and fine for what we needed the breakfast was extensive and there was always something to eat there was a nespresso machine in the room and a great bathroom and shower we had dressing gowns and the towels were extra fluffy it was a great hotel stay
