my partner and i had booked a two night stay for the rugby world cup and found it to be a great choice the staff were very friendly the breakfasts were great and the suites were spacious and modern the location of the hotel was a perfect location for the rwc we were able to walk back to the hotel in minutes whilst others were queuing for three hours for a tube back into central london all in all a fabulous stay
