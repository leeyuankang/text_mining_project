we have state here before but this time upgraded to the one bedroom suite as a special treat staff are always very helpful happy and friendly location is amazing and the room was well equipped although the lounge area isn t quite as spacious as it looked in the photos sadly the whole gym was closed when we went to use it also the breakfast runs out quick at busy times and we kept having to ask staff for knives and top ups of run out food etc the food we did have was great though
