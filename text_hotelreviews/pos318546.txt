the first nights at granados were booked through a travel agent as we were travelling on a tour but i booked the extra night at booking com we could walk to most locations or get a taxi at the corner lots of little cafes around room had a balcony which was lovely to sit out on it took us a few minutes to get used to the automatic doors on each floor
