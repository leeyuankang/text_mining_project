the hotel was very centrally located close to major attractions and many restaurants and high end shopping my room was very small with no window which was a bit off putting the room was nicely decorated and the toiletries were top notch including lavender linen spray i felt that the restaurant was overpriced so did not use it the staff was helpful and courteous
