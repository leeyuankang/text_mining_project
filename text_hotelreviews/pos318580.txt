the hotel is well located away from the tourist area but not too far it is stylish and there are lots of great bars and restaurantes nearby the hotel is really comfortable and quiet there were clearly lots of other people staying at the hotel as it was full but we never heard anyone in the same way the room was extremely clean but we never saw or heard any cleaning staff a great place to stay in a great city
