great room very clean and modern very friendly staff with good english skills lots of places to eat nearby the metro is blocks away and one stop to the gothic quarter i would stay here again i did not eat at the restaurant as we wanted to get out of the hotel but i would expect the hotel restaurant to be at least good and probably quite nice
