good location if you want to spend some time on a beach very nice beach is just in minutes walk not so close to the city centre so usually we used taxi to get there staff is helpful they gave us a smoking room the smell of smoking was strong there at the beginning but they changed it to non smoking on our request without any problems good bathroom in the room big clean and design is nice
