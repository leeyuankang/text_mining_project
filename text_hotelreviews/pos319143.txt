it was my third time at novotel amsterdam city i have choose the same hotel again because the quality was higher before however my last visit was a complete disappointment i booked a regular room with bathtube however i had to change my room because the first room given did not have a bathtube they argued with me that my room was upgraded to executive type and that is the reason i thought that it was a joke because the room was not an executive room it was definitely the same type of room but without a bathtube also i had to call house keeping to have bath robe and bath slippers we were in the room my husband and i however one small bottle of water was left in the minibar and it was only for the first day this is not generous also breakfast quality was lower than my last stay i am sure that i will not prefer novotel amsterdam city in my next visit to amsterdam
