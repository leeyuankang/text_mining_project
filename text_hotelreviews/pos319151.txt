wifi and business area was great concierge very affable breakfast staff were obliging nice outdoor relaxation area the setting is more suburban business and away from big crowds however the location is excellent as the tram is only away if you purchase the iamsterdam card you can get to the heart of amsterdam and back so simply on tram
