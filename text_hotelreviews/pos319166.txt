if you are travelling to amsterdam the novotel hotel is a really good choice for price and location it is really close to the railway station amsterdam rai close to metro orange line that goes to amsterdam central nieuwmarkt or opposite way westwijk the metro amsterdam central dam and more is on the same line with a step away from the rai train station happy hour with cheap good cocktails are from pm every saturday sunday in the hotel bar place is big bright and room are spacious and very clean i stayed with two other friends in a double bed and sofa bed in the same room and with bag each and lots of small souvenir bags there was still room left there are usb sockets to charge your tech close to the bed so you dont even need adapters bathroom is normal small sink few drawers but nice big shower with rain head didn t eat there unfortunately but the menu looked really full of local and international meals really recommended
