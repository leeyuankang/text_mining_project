it was our first time to amsterdam and the staff were really friendly and helpful in guiding us in the right directions and we also relieved a few little gifts with it being near christmas and new year as we were there for new years eve we had plenty of information to know what was happening and also the best way to return to the hotel saying the bed was comfy was an understatement it was a dream and the overall hotel experience was top quality
