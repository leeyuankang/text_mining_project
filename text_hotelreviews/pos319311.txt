the staff were extremely friendly polite and helpful the hotel was very nice clean and the bed was really comfy the room was a good size as well the bar and restaurant was good to minute walk from the tram and metro which was handy as only took to get to the city centre i finally got the pat on the back of my friends just like they do on the booking com advert
