this was my time at the hotel i love the rooms and just how comfortable they are the staff was more than willing to help us with any request we have at all times of the day and night they made a mistake with our order and in minutes we had a fresh one with no debate the hotel is a minute walk to get the tram straight to the centre of amsterdam i will be defiantly keeping the hotel in mind for the next trip to amsterdam
