this was an ideal location for our family on a short break to amsterdam just a short train ride from the airport early check in as we had executive rooms very helpful staff on reception who gave great advice and so close to the tram to get in and out of the centre breakfast was great with long serving time and lots of choice really can t fault the service or hotel all staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful obviously it s quiet at night as there s nothing to do in the area and no nice views as in the business district but the service hotel and ease of travel more than makes up for this highly recommend this hotel
