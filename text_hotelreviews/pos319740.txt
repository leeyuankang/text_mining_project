staff was absolutely outstanding i travel a lot and have a sort of jaded all big hotels are really alike at the end of the day but this one really was different and special staff seemed genuinely happy to be working there so their care of guests came right out of that feeling it wasn t a forced plastic i m being nice or i ll get in trouble kind of niceness it was just a really great atmosphere i had fun conversations with several people as well as tips for another trip the hotel itself is gorgeous an well kept renovated victorian rail hotel i was in separate rooms trip was broken up and the rooms really have personality the one where i could see the eurostar from my window was really fun
