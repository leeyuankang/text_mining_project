for us the location was perfect coming in from the eurostar and having the tube station right there it made getting where we needed to go easy and quick this is obviously a marriott property that caters to a business clientele as many business professionals were working in the lobby the check in desk provided excellent customer service and stored our bags for us as we arrived early and weren t able to get into our room just yet the soft bath robes were a nice touch too the breakfast buffet was very good and many choices were offered so we could have whatever we liked all in all a great choice for us
