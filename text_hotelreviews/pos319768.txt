the font facing reception staff and staff at the entrance were very friendly and welcoming made such a difference and didn t feel that we were on a conveyor belt a much better experience than at the pullman next door keep up the great friendly approach we asked for a quiet room and the room on the floor we got was perfect the restaurant staff manager asking for feedback during the meal was so refreshing and really keen to know how to improve the menu and taking in the feedback positively and eargerly wanting to make changes it was so refreshing breakfast was perfectly relaxing too
