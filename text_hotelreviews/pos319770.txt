the architecture of this beautifully restored building is second to none junior suite overlooking station platform was the best view the trains did not disturb us didnt hear them until the morning for the guests who love trains like we too this was the best room would love to return crudite afternoon tea and cakes drinks all available as part of the access to chambers club which is included in junior suite price to get the full experience from this hotel i would recommend this more to pay but in my view the experience was worth it the little relaxation pool is lovely too
