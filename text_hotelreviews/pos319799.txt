although pricey it is a wonderful location for a short break we upgraded from the new to the older rooms with access to the chambers club which was worthwhile staff very attentive and good selection of free to members food and drinks of which we didn t take full advantage room well appointed and decor and height of ceilings amazing it was also nice that the history came through in for example framed plans of the old building pictures in the room and the coffee table book to look at the gilbert scott dining room also has wonderful decor and good if not outstanding food but a very helpful sommelier as the hotel is right next to the international station there are lots of close at hand eateries and shops well located to visit the british library or to walk down to other venues such as the british museum we didn t try out the pool but fitness could certainly be maintained just by the distances walked along corridors and up stairs if one didn t use the lifts
