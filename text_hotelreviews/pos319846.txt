several years ago on my last trip to london i noticed the renovations taking place to this historic and grand victorian hotel while walking to st pancras to depart on the eurostar i told myself the next time i m here i m going to stay there i ve long had an appreciation for history and the better parts of those bygone eras also i feel that if we want to ensure that such beautiful historic places aren t torn down we need to support businesses that invest in their restoration so i was quite pleased with the experience of stepping back through time which was my primary reason for staying here and booking in the chambers suites the room was wonderful with a spectacular view inside st pancras station which we specifically requested and the service was of course first rate of particular note was the eurostar transfer service included with staying in a chambers suite the hotel is already literally connected to the station so is very convenient to eurostar however when staying in a chambers suite the staff comes to your room collects all your baggage escorts you past all the queues at security and takes you directly to your specific coach finally placing all baggage on board for you i simply cannot articulate how smooth and relaxing this made the experience when traveling as a couple with my elderly father i strongly recommend you put this in your list at least once even if only for the one night on either the day before your departure or the day of your arrival by eurostar
