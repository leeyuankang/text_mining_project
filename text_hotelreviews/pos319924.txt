the hotel was nothing less than amazing the victorian part of the building was wonderful even the barlow wing was not that bad really spacious room facing the inside part of st pancras international station the service and cleanliness were perfect the breakfast in the booking office was truly charming a bit expensive eventually great value for money considered the average price of stars hotels in london
