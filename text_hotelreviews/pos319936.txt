although i paid for wifi initially the money was returned as i joined the marriott club always enjoy this hotel as great location for eurostar and visiting london and the building is lovely we have not yet stayed in the old part as it is very pricey although one day i would love to do so we always have a look at the lovely staircase when we are there however it has always been very comfortable in the barlow and everything is at a high standard
