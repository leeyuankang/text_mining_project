a treat for my birthday my friend told the hotel pre arrival of this and we were upgraded to a king size room rather than the queen we booked which was lovely spacious and comfortable following an early check in we left the hotel and on our return to the room found a card and slice of cake with a happy birthday message what a lovely touch the hotel is magnificent and sensitively restored we had our evening meal in the booking office which had a wonderful atmosphere relaxed and yet stylish the service was impeccable and the food delicious and great value for money
