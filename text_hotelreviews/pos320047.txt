the sheer number of staff available and willing to help at all times was phenomenal and the free room upgrade was an unexpected but well received bonus the location of the hotel is second to none especially as we were travelling out from kings cross in the morning the breakfast options were superb the room itself was very well kept and we had a well deserved relaxing night
