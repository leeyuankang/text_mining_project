i really liked the attentive staff the concierge who wears a bowler hat and hails you a taxi the very attentive staff the food the history of the building the sports channels on the tv the lady playing the harp taking your luggage up to your room the breakfast in bed experience with beautifull linen and fresh squeezed orange juice and all the little touches that make it a truly star experience
