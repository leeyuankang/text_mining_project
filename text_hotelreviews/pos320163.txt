the welcome we recieved was excellent staff were attentive smiley and efficient all members of staff were very proud of the hotel as i walked through the corridors staff told me to look at the magnificent stair case and decor the building is amazing beautiful and a quote from the book in our room on renovation of the hotel stated this railway station and hotels past was going to be its future a sentiment that i believe would really get people thinking before demolishing fantastic architecture from the past
