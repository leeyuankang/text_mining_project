it was the weekend of the camden registry office wedding we were offered a room on the floor on arrival which was excellent as we were early however when we got to it someone came out so it appeared it was already occupied it turned out to be management using it for room audit purposes and he the manager apologised profusely and took us downstairs to be allocated a different room for our inconvenience the hotel provided us with a bottle of verve champagne as an apology really well looked after and would definitely stay again the booking office bar is excellent and service great as it was at breakfast each morning
