i liked the location of the hotel for example on a dockland footpath all in a relaxed area i liked the little things as well like the earl grey tea in the rooms the view of the docklands water outside from the restaurant good food free parking and no hassle with the car is fantastic didn t see any ticket wardens or receive any fines nice bar area for a pint of beer lovely rooms with a view nice staff at reception brilliant hotel for the meeting in the excel
