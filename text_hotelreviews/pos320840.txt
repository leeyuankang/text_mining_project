stayed for nights while running around london minute walk to the station and easy access to all of london from there emirates cable car experience system is close by and you can even take a stroll there along the lake front the hotel booked me in early to be exact as they had rooms open even if rooms are not open yet they have an excellent luggage storing facility even once i had checked out the looked after my bags till it was time to go to the airport great friendly staff that were very helpful and super efficient the staff greet you and make you feel at home the breakfast was a super range and variety making sure you did not go hungry even dinner at the hotel was excellent have a great menu and decent prices the rooms are spacious and clean with good aircon systems so even with the heat wave in london the room was cool and comfy a large tv and good shower make it a home away from home even though you are only a short distance from the london city airport you can not hear the plane taking off from the rooms super quiet will definitely be staying there again
