i loved the comfort of the bed and the fact that the walls were sound proof so we couldn t hear the noise of the airport next door to us the ac was a great help because of the heat as well as the amazing curtains which blocked out any sunlight we didn t want in the room the reception staff were also very helpful the complimentary cookies were such an amazing touch definitely a hotel i will be booking again when we come back to london
