the hotel was easy to find from the dlr station and for the duration of our stay all of the staff were friendly and helpful we received a room upgrade on arrival as they did not have the twin room we booked the room we were allocated was great very clean and spacious and with perfect weather we made the most of our stay in the area and walked by the river and took ride on the emirates air line to take in the views we definately enjoyed our stay here and will definately be back
