my partner and myself had checked into another hotel just down the road from doubletree and it was awful it was cramped the bathroom was tiny and the toilet wouldn t flush the walls were so paper thin you could hear people talking in the next room as if there was no wall there at all as it was obvious we weren t going to be able to get any sleep there we went online and reserved a room at the doubletree we had been there less than minutes but they wouldn t refund any of the we had paid so by the time we reached the doubletree we were very stressed out and upset but the staff at doubletree were very welcoming and friendly and the cookies we got when we checked in were lovely breakfast was delicious and set us up for each day sightseeing around london there was no noise from neighbouring rooms the only sound you could hear was the occasional door slamming the hotel is about minutes walk from prince regent dlr station for connections to the underground you can also take the cable cars across to the arena the hotel had beautiful views of the river and we would definitely stay here again
