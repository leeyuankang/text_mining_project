the location suited our social plans but might not suit everyone the staff were very professional and friendly i wanted to watch the lions test on saturday morning and they happily arranged to turn on the tvs in the closed bar good sized room for london with comfortable bed the only criticism was that the room aircon was inefficient and unbelievably noisy blowing hard and rattling as if it was going to fall to pieces breakfast was absolutely fine for a buffet parking slots are available but they are in high demand we arrived at around easily found a slot and were checked in by a delightful receptionist
