we liked this hotel during our one night stay it was convenient for the dlr with connections to the centre of london the staff were all friendly and very welcoming the bar stayed open late into the early hours of the morning after our evening out at a concert we were all very happy with our hotel choice and would consider coming back here should we ever be staying in london again
