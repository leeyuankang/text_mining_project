really loved this hotel the check in was smooth and we were greeted by friendly staff and a free warm cookie the facilities were great the room actually had a plug socket next to the bed which is logical but mostly unheard of in other hotels location was excellent no pun intended but right next to the excel centre for our weekend at comic con over all a fab hotel
