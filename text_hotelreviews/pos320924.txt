the room was bright airy and very clean plenty of towels and shower gels etc in the bathroom air conditioning in the room made it a very comfortable nights sleep as i don t like a warm room food in the restaurant and also room service was excellent and very keenly priced staff were very friendly and never walked past you without acknowledging you
