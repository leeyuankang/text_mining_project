wonderful hotel very friendly caring and attentive staff unfortunately i ended up in the hospital for two days during our five night stay each day the staff inquired about my health and asked if we needed anything when we were checking out we were informed that there would be no charge because our holiday had been disrupted by my illness we were speechless we had never experienced such caring and generosity we are eternally grateful to the management and staff of this fine hotel
