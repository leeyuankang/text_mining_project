we booked our room so that we had somewhere to stay on our wedding night for two nights when we arrived at we were still able to check in and the staff were amazing we were given warm cookies and to top it off they upgraded us to a suite free of charge as a wedding gift the suite was awesome clean and very comfortable i had to remind myself that we were only there for two nights would definitely come back here to stay
