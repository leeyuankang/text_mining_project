i like the spaciousness of the room the staff there was very nice especially the young black lady didn t get a name upon check in she was so welcoming and nice she even gave me a cookie which made me feel that much more better and even when i asked for more sugar and an extra sheet she was more then happy to help me with those things she made me and my boyfriend very welcome
