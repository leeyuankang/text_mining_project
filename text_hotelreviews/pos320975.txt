really impressed with the room very clean and spacious nice and quiet room had a modern feel to it and you couid tell everytime in the room was of a good quality really dissapointed however thst there was no water to drink in the room and when i went to reception they said i couid get it from the bar for i couid get a liter bottel witch is a absolute rip off its not about money its about the principle just left a unpleasent taste during overwise a lovely stay
