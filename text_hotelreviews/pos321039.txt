lovely clean modern hotel really nice rooms and added bonus of a fitness studio which you often dont get with my room rate in london evening meal good value for money and the steak and chips was lovely though it always puzzles me why it comes on a chopping board not a plate i guess im old fashioned great food and service all staff were polite and friendly
