the staff were all brilliant and couldn t do enough to help when the receptionist found out we were honeymooners he upgraded us to a suite which was wonderful particularly as i was ill in bed for days while we were there so my husband was able to spend time watching tv in our lounge without disturbing me the breakfasts were brilliant with a fabulous wide choice the cookies on check in were the best ever
