hotel staff were very friendly professional and helpful our room was fairly small but absolutely fine as we were out all day the room was very clean the location was great we used the dockland light railway a lot minute walk from the hotel we rented a car at one point and had a minute walk to london city airport to collect and drop off so easy would definitely stay there again
