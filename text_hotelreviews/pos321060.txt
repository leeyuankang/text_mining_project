the hotel staff were very polite very friendly and happy to help the hotel its self was very clean and a warmly feel about the place great comfort no children running around and only a short hop on the train to the big city the location was great too over looking the docks and at night it was so peaceful plenty of places to eat but the hotels own restaurant was excellent with a good section of food available stars
