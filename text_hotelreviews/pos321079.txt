it did the trick we had an early flight from city airport and as we live miles away we we wanted to travel in the night before we arrived at approx dumped our cases in the room and went down to the restaurant for dinner my husband had the pulled lamb shepherds pie and was very disappointed i had the grilled salmon and it was decent the room itself was averagely comfortable my only gripe was that there was little air in the room the window only opened a crack and the a c system is set not cool at this time of the year according to the front desk when i phoned them in desperation at all in all it was an ok stay might try another hotel next time but would rule out a return visit
