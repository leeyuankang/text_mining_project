came down for mcm comicon and had an amazing time at doubletree all the staff were friendly and helpful had a slight mess up with our bookings but was put right immediately and respectfully my partner has a nut allergy and is gluten intolerant and the chefs dealt with it brilliantly if the comi con is in excel again will be coming back and recommend anyone else coming down to stay there
