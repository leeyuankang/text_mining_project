very spacious suite including large entry hall well set out larger than normal sized bathroom generous sized kitchen living area and the best bed i have ever slept in ever staff responded immediately to requests for extra towels etc the venue was perfect in terms of its location if you were attending an event at the excel centre too far from the center of town if you are visiting london as a tourist sound proofing seemed to work really well too
