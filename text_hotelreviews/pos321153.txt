it was minutes walk from the excel and prince regant station the receptionist was more than happy to give me directions back to the airport when i was checking out which i appreciated greatly the room was very clean and the bed was lovely and cosy there was also a safe in the room which made me feel a lot better about leaving my macbook there overall i was very happy with my stay and will more than likely stay there again next year if i got to sitc again
