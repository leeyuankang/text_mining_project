it is great to the subway above ground train portion fantastic price for a doubletree warmed fresh chocolate chip cookie and all great hotel and breakfast just on the west side of the london city airport you have to go up two stations on the above ground subway train and double back to the airport it is two stops from the cable car over the river and the olympics are on the south side of the river when you go to london the departure tax built into your plane ticket is up to dollars in a business class ticket about in a coach ticket you might explore staying in paris and ride the one hour chunnel train to london and stay a few days in a hotel and go back to paris to sightsee and go home channel train is cheap if booked well in advance indian restaurants are great and so is fish and chips all between and dollars after doing it i recommend the hop on hop off tour bus because it takes you where you need to go instead of figuring out which subway stop and includes a boat ride on the thames and is cheap to extend once you buy the initial two days
