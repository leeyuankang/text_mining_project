stayed here in when it was the ramada but the new upgrade makes its an even better hotel now beds were very comfy with nice soft pillows shower had low side which made it easy to get in and out of the warm choc chip cookie on arrival was a welcome treat wifi was good occasionally bit spotty bar area was nicely laid out with comfy sofas staff were all very good very professional and very helpful free car park was nice but had to park around the side of the hotel luckily my room looked out onto the same car park only a short walk to the excel centre and the dlr
