my first time at this hotel the hotel it self was very nice and better than what i actually thought it would be the staff was very attentive to me and my family i couldn t ask for better staff my partner had not come to breakfast yet and i was with my year old and one waiter asked what i wanted so he went and got everything including my daughters breakfast i appreciated that very much i booked a queen room with a view but the room did not have a fridge so they changed my room to a suite which was much bigger had a fridge and everything it was just excellent especially for my daughter and my partner as i planned all of this for father s day weekend we had a lovely weekend thank you x
