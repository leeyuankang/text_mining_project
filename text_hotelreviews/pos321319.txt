receptionist needs to smile more and have a better greeting at hotel could not understand her sometimes very difficult to understand she tended to mumble she also tried to charge me full price of we booked on special offer of she seemed a bit put out when i questioned price good job really i saw it not a good start to be honest i was told there was loads of spaces for free parking by reception when i rang day before no chance we had to pay over for parking as amount of spaces free you have is a ridiculous amount for the number of rooms in hotel would not consider staying again whilst in london as not good value and would never recommend this hotel to anyone have stayed in doubletree hiltons before but not like this one overall clean room beds harder than normal
