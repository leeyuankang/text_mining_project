nothing to like booked for three nights as i was visiting friends room was basic but that s all i needed as i was only sleeping there and planned on spending most of my time sightseeing bed was comfortable nothing special bathroom very basic but not the cleanest with mould on the bath tub but a quick shower was sufficient unfortunately the only problem was the fact that unknown to me a deposit of a large amount of money had been taken from account even though i had been reassured that my card had only been swiped for room service if i chose to use it this only came to my attention when shopping and my card declined which was hugely embarrassing as i knew i had sufficient funds to cover payment having contacted the bank i was told that the money had been taken by ramada returned to the hotel to enquire why this had happened only to be confronted by a very rude receptionist who said it was standard procedure and that i must have authorised it when i argued this and asked to see the manager who was called naveed i was horrified at his attitude as it was worse than hers the fact that he couldn t speak english and had problems understanding basic english made matters worse to the point another guest who had overheard even tried explaining but even he was shocked that he was the manager yet couldn t speak basic english i asked to see the notice regarding the card being swiped and it stated which is fair enough so why was my card swiped for a much larger amount they didn t know but all he could say was that the money would be refunded into my account in the next few days so i was stuck in london with whatever cash i had in pocket and ended up relying on my friends to cover the meals out etc the only good thing that came out of my stay was the lovely staff in the morning who were preparing breakfast great little team who couldn t do enough and always greeted you with a smile and the breakfast was delicious
