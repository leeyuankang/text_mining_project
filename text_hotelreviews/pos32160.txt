location was great less than mins walk away from the westfield shopping center the over ground was next door the hotel itself was lovely nice cool modern and comfy rooms this was particularly needed in the heat shower was really good and staff was so nice bringing drinks to our room always welcoming as we went in and out of the hotel prices for drinks were good too i will definitely stay here again
