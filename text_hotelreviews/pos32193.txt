the price goodness me this must be the best bargain in london i have paid times this for much pokier rooms bed very comfy staff very smiley and we were even taken to our room by one member of staff the other one we met offered to help me locate something online without being prompted good shower too i will recommend this hotel highly especially if this price is the norm
