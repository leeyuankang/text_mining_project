staff was very attentive and very polite it s right next to shepherd s bush market station depending on a person s preference it could be bad due to noise or convenient since it s easier to go anywhere and for myself it s the latter it s close to westfield shopping centre for you shopaholics min walk for me for the muslims there are quite a number of halal eatery in the area and a very nice halal burger joint awesome the internet is superfast and a minibar is provided with tea and some biscuits
