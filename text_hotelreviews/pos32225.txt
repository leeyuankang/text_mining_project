generally i would recommend the hotel is quite small and although the rooms are not that big they have nice furnishings and the staff were nice and friendly i would go back but would be careful to choose another room i work in the travel industry so like to be fair with my comments there were a couple of negatives but on the whole don t let this review put you off as my complaints were to do with the one room i am sure the others are lovely
