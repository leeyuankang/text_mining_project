this is one of those hotels which simply deserves all the superlatives you can throw at it beautiful and functional design high standards of comfort excellent levels of service and an ideal location in the central district of the city the attention to detail is definitely present down to the little things like the handwritten welcome note and the mini chocolate cakes in your room to the copy of the new york times that s delivered to your door each morning i loved my stay here and will definitely be returning
