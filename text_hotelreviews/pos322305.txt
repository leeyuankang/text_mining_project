amazing location friendly staff so many small touches that make it a special hotel that i ll certainly be visiting again free amenities like bottles of wine water tea and coffee maker with daily refills really add a touch i appreciated their brasserie for breakfast is also really amazing i didn t get breakfast included and only tried it one day a la carte will certainly try again
