excellent hotel from the friendly staff to the fast room service to the spacious luxurious and modern rooms every detail was well considered and taken care of the espresso machine and austrian wines in each room was also a plus and it is great to have a sofa in them too location couldn t be more central and the restaurant and food is also great i wish there were more hotels like this in there world
