great location being able to bring the complimentary bottles of wine in your room down to dinner was great all staff were friendly and very helpful room was fantastic with a great view of the opera house beds very comfy and additional firmer or softer pillows were available on request can t recommend this hotel highly enough will definitely want to return soon
