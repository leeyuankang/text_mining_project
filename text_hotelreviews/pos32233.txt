it is a clean modern and comfortable boutique hotel located next to the underground station at shepherd s bush market it is easy to get to all areas of london from this location it does not have much in the way of extra amenities just a very small bar in the reception area but it is very good value for a london hotel we didn t eat at the hotel because there are places to have breakfast within a few minutes walk
