was our first stop on a day european vacation the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful the room was of a pretty good size though not spacious as far as us standards perhaps they could ve added to the floor space by eliminating the foot tub and just making do with the large shower modern and clean with a complementary mini bar couldn t have asked for a better place to start our vacation
