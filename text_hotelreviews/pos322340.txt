the staff of guesthouse vienna from the reception dining and even the bell boy their service was really super excellent location was fantastic i was shocked that i booked the superior double room on the day i arrived and the room beverage was filled with bottles each of white and red wines a pepsi an orange juice a tonic a beer and bottles of sparkling and still water to my surprise next day the housekeeping continues to fill up those beverages again for the last nights that i have stayed i had a total of bottles of red and white wines i drank to my hearts content with no additional charge at all i made up my mind to have vienna as my stop over coming from berlin for nights and i left the luggage with guesthouse to travel to salzburg and budapest for nights the minute i checked in all the luggage was already in the room their service was so excellent and i have decided to update to deluxe opera view room which is facing the state opera and albertina there was a little miscommunication and you guess what the guesthouse vienna upgraded my room and i only have to pay the difference of euro and got a roller bed for my daughter which they charge for euro got waived for nights fantastic the reception area went to suggest that i take a day tour to danube river and the abbey and they arrange it within mins my family enjoyed so much tks to all the staff in guesthouse vienna gabi natasha alex and all of them whom has made my holiday a memorable one
