the hotel was in a great quiet location in the centre of the old city and in easy walking distance to many of the main attractions shopping center our room was very spacious and we had a nice view of the opera house the bathroom with a separate toilet room was also very spacious and well appointed the hotel had a great restaurant bakery associated with it which was very busy for breakfast and lunch but a little quieter for dinner the hotel very generously supplied complementary good quality local austrian wines which we could either drink in our room or take to the hotel restaurant to drink with dinner at no charge the complementary wines beer were restocked each day one the best hotels we stayed at in our week tour of europe i have no hesitations in recommending this hotel
