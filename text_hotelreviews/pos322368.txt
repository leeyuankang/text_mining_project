a lovely contemporary hotel in the heart of the city with good design touches the complementary gruner vetliner provided as part of the room stay was worthy of note the wine was replenished every day if used which was excellent reception staff were very helpful as were the porters the hotel is in a perfect central location and we could not fault the hotel well worth a return visit
