we had a wonderful stay the rooms are fabulous and lots of little touches complimentary bottles of wine maps personalised business cards with the hotel address etc we loved the reading nook in the window and the comfortable beds staff were friendly and very helpful helped us track down a pair of glasses left on the bus and good restaurant recommendations
