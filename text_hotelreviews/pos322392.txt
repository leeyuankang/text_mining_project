from the moment we stepped through the doors of the guesthouse hotel the staff could not have done more for my boyfriend and i nor been more helpful accommodating and pleasant the rooms were beautifully presented and very well designed with the bathrooms having wonderfully large waterfall showers and gorgeous molten brown toiletries as it was our anniversary we were presented with a beautiful hand written welcome card and some cakes upon arrival in our room which was a lovely personal touch an additional highlight was when upon realising i had forgotten my toothbrush i was delighted to be provided with a complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste by the concierge room service was extremely fast and efficient and the food was just lovely we had breakfast each morning and some cakes for afternoon tea would highly recommend the mini lemon meringue pies the mini bar was extremely well stocked and we were thrilled to find that the majority of the goods were complimentary including bottles of wine and beer amazing value the hotel itself is in an excellent location across from the beautiful albertina museum and a short walk from the opera houses while the hotel is tucked away on a quiet street there is some great shopping and christmas markets just around the corner from start to finish we had an absolutely wonderful stay and i honestly could not recommend this hotel enough it is excellent value for money and worth every penny we just wish we could have stayed another night or two thank you so much guesthouse staff sincerely young couple from dublin ireland
