we loved everything about this hotel the stylish interiors the location the immaculate cleanliness of the rooms but most of all the wonderful staff friendly knowledgeable and welcoming nothing was too much trouble they were not obsequious just very natural and friendly my husband celebrated a birthday during our stay and on return to our room on that afternoon there was a place of delicious cakes for us to share with a personal note free daily newspaper wine fruit juice and waters just fabulous would definitely recommend as a super hotel to stay at when staying in this amazing city
