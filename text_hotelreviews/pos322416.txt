the hotel is perfectly located in vienna with everything within a short walk the modern room with free wine and non alcoholic drinks and high end tv and coffeemaker was very quiet although you had to call for hot water for tea it never took more than minutes to get it the service was impeccable when had just spent nights at the kempinski in hamburg and i would rate this hotel stars over that all of the staff was extremely helpful
