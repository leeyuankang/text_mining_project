what a great find from the moment we arrived we could tell we were going to enjoy our stay the receptionists were so friendly and helpful and throughout our stay they recommend restaurants booked reservations at restaurants suggested places to visit and gave gems of information to ensure we made the most of our time in vienna they also went out their way to accommodate me with gluten free bread for breakfast freshly cooked bread rolls delicious all the staff throughout the hotel were incredibly friendly helpful and professional
