it s a bargain to stay here try to compare prices between here and their actual website they will match your rate if you find a better deal staffs are very friendly and services have been good room is very modern i like the finish of the room i e feels like home great location too i would say it is just on the left side of shepherd s bush market station on circle hammersmith city line or minutes walk from shepherd s bush station on central line if you want to avoid changing trains at white city internet spped was good as well
