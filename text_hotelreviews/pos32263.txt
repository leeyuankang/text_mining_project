the staff were excellent very considerate on arrival with a patch on my eye from surgery the gentleman on reception said that he thought it would be better for us to have a twin room because it was a little bigger than the twin room we had booked and i would have more space to move about i thought this was very kind and considerate if and when we return to this area we will book into this hotel again it was clean and refreshing
