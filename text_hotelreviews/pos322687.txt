the room was very comfortable i often have back issues after sleeping in hotels but the bed was great and i had no issues also the bath in the room was great to relax and recover the muscles from walking around the city the rooms were nice and clean as well i was on transit for a day in vienna so the location near the metro and train station was superb i was able to visit a couple of sights easily and travel in relative comfort
