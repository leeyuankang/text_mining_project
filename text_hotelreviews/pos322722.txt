the hotel location was very convenient its just next to westbahnhof so if you are travelling by train or need to go to from the airport by bus its less than minutes walk with your bags the room was good it had everything we need it even had a complimentary tea coffee maker staff was helpful basically we had a nice stay in this hotel
