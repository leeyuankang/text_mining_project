the man at the front desk was extremely friendly and very helpful the room was small but cozy and clean there was a thermostat in the room which i really appreciated given how cold london can be the shower had amazing pressure and the lotions body wash smelled great the breakfast in the morning was ok but given how expensive london is i appreciated having that as an option there is also a bar in the lobby so i was able to take a glass of champagne back to my room the neighborhood was very closely located to the tube and bus station but the vibe of the neighborhood was a bit weird grungy i was able to take the bus to another part of town for dinner which was an easy commute given its only a minute walk to the tube bus
