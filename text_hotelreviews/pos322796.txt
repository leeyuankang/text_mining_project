bed was great breakfast was fine they didn t set out more food than they would use and the woman who monitored the room provided fresh eggs and bacon when asked the location was quiet and in good walking distance from the rai center where my conference was held trams were easy to catch within about a block of the hotel atms were nearby good restaurant choices nearby and the staff was friendly and helpful
