nice location in front of the market and literally next to the metro station it s not in central london so it may take a while to reach your destination but apart from that it s a great place to be there s also a huge mall minutes away on foot the staff was super friendly and there s free cookies in the room and a free newspaper you can pickup at the reception even got an upgrade to a double room free
