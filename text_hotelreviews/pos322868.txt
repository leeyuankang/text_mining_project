the lady at the front desk was so lovely and helpful the number tram stops right outside the hotel and to get the center of amsterdam is not too far of a walk alternatively you can walk about meters up the road and catch tram or both these trams go to amsterdam central station as well rooms we clean and beds were comfortable we really enjoyed our stay
