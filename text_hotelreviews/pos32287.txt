when we arrived there were no bathrobes in the room however we called reception and they were brought to us promptly the vanity mirror lights were a glamorous little touch spotlessly clean all over and great continental breakfast provided which was included in the price the location was brilliant as the tube was literally next door connecting shepherds bush market with the rest of london on the hammersmith and city line shepherds bush tube station on the central line was also only a minute walk down the road would not hesitate to stay again on my next visit to london for the price well worth it
