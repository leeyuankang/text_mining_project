i really enjoyed how informative the reception staff was and how polite and welcoming everyone was i also was more than satisfied with the housekeeping i was happy with the floor room as we had access to windows and doors that led to a little patio which was handy for a quick cig although a non smoking hotel it makes you mindful not to leave a mess while out there
