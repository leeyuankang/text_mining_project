upon arrival the staff were very accommodating we got to the hotel hours before check in and were very pleased to hear that they had our room ready i was initially skeptical about the panoramic views of amsterdam but it is safe to say when we walked into our room on the floor we were blown away the view was spectacular the bedroom was spacious with everything in perfect working order i couldn t fault this hotel in any way in addition to this the bar on the top floor make fantastic cocktails unfortunately with our speedy night trip we didn t have time to make use of the spa next time i would recommend renting the bicycles you can do this from the reception and cycling up the road to bakers and roasters for the best brunch in amsterdam enjoy everyone
