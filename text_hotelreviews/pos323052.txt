our executive room windows were slightly smeared merky which gave an obscured view we did have an issue with the aircon on arrival which took a while to resolve but once it was the room felt much more comfortable the bed was nice and big the pillows lovely and soft the room was spacious the bathroom was very nice big bath the temperature of the water for the bath never felt hot enough for me personally as i like an extra hot bath the toilet seat was to die for with the heated seat and the built in wash dry functions
