the bed was so comfortable the view from the room was lovely attentive staff enjoyed the breakfast and even when busy you felt comfortable great atmosphere went to the teppanyaki restaurant in the hotel and we had a and half hour experience a wonderful idea for a special event or a group of friends the meal was fantastic i was so impressed with all the staff at the hotel they would take the time to assist and ensure that you were happy for example we are tea drinkers and there was a coffee machine in the room but no kettle within minutes a kettle appeared with a friendly staff member
