fantastic hotel in a great area unless you want to be on the doorstep of the city centre it s about miles from centraal station in a cosmopolitan mainly residential area but with loads of restaurants cafes and quiet bars team stops walk from hotel and gets you into leidersplein within mins four restaurants three of which have michelin stars not cheap but worth a visit right on a canal which means pleasant walks area feels very safe day and night genuine star hotel for not a lot more than some poor hotels in the city centre it wen has its own taxi rank so no excuses wouldn t hesitate to stay here again unless i was on a stag do also has a really nice bar on the top floor oh aye and you can hire a boat on the canal outside
