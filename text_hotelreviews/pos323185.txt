visit amsterdam regularly with work or more times a year and this is the best so far a little bit more expensive and outside the city than others so would advise for couples or the older generation not boys on a lads holiday as the hotels location is a ten minute ride away by cab the staff service and facilities are amazing here with great restaraunts especially szanka
