i loved the hotel s facilities the room the reception service the parking on our deal the parking was included in the price of the room we dinned at the the serre restaurant and the food was a gastronomic experience we paid for persons euros including dishes dessert and bottles of water quite reasonable price for the quality of the food but the portions were so small the pool was fantastic although it costed eur for a child and eur for an adult the room was fantastic we had a junior suite very spacious although in one room the also have at the reception a smoking room for the clients i got it through booking for eur for nights for adults in a double room then i contacted the hotel and asked for an additional bed in the room for our child that costed eur per night but along with the upgrade from a standard double room to a junior suite its an expensive hotel but you will enjoy it for sure breakfast was eur per adult and a reduced price i think per child but we didn t use it we had breakfast in the nearby melegg restaurant with lovely omelets it is situated m approx before reaching from the hotel the tram stop for tram no however we had to quew for mins outside in the street this disturbed us a bit all in all a fantastic experience and we are looking forward to go back i certainly recommend but search for a deal
