i have been searching for days to find a star hotel to stay for a night for or less after been reading reviews here i gave it a try and i have to say it was really good good location it is right next to the tube station but with no noise from the trains great staff and a very modern room for just for one night i also really enjoyed the tv in the room and the furniture and the style of the room the staff i dealt with was really nice too
