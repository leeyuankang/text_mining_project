the location is very cozy neighborhood make sure to detour around the area while walking towards the amstel station the room size is pretty satisfying a selection of tea and coffee is great the bed is very comfy i got the view of the canal at the back of the hotel right in front of a big tree so a little privacy from pedestrians no noisy ac very much satisfied because i m a very light sleeper but the walls are a bit thin the breakfast ordered is taken at the seat from great portion and good taste had egg benedict french toast with strawberry jam and english breakfast the staffs are very welcoming hotel s deco is unique with a lot of accents overall it made my impression of amsterdam very memorable
