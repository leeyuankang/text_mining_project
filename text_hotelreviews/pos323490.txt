when we first arrived at this hotel we were concerned as it was out of town and seemed very plain from the outside but after staying there for nights we would never stay anywhere else in amsterdam the room was clean quiet and very comfortable the complimentary breakfasts are amazing we also ate dinner at the restaurant two nights and the food is fantastic also the location turned out to be just fine as it s just a long block walk to the amstel station where you can catch trains the metro trams and buses finally the best part of the hotel is the staff they would do anything for us they explained public transportation and recommended fantastic restaurants where they made us reservations
