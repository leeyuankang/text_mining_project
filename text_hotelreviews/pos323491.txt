the restaurant service is outstanding excellent food prices ok for the quality you get overall experience is certainly something to remember about the trip in amsterdam modern decoration very pleasant atmosphere comfortable room breakfast is ok but a la carte for a busy hotel does not feel as the right decision for customers
