it was near to the public transport and away from the city center so you can relax at the hotel area and with minutes can get to the city centre the people at the hotel are amazingly friendly and easy to talk with actually all the people we met in amsterdam were friendly helpful and everybody speaks fluently english the breakfast was also perfect the orders were taken from the table the hotel itself has an intresting design that is worth seeing we definitely recommend hotel v to other visitors thank you
