the furnishing and the style of the hotel are very nice kind of industrial contemporary designed the restaurant is quite famous it means you need to reserve a table even on a monday night breakfast is la carte and delicious the hotel is not very close to the city center but if you are in amsterdam for business and don t need to go there is absolutely perfect good wifi connection nice bathroom complimentary water bottles and nespresso coffee the real deal not the watery coffee normally served outside of italy
