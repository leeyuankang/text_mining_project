the facilities were excellent the breakfast more than lived up to expectations if you are hesitant on the location don t be the train stop is a very short walk and is into the centre in five minutes the tickets are cheap and tge stop is easy to navigate alternatively you can rent bikes again an easy ride along a dedicated bike path for aboutin mins the restaurant staff value and comfort of the hotel make the location worth the effort
