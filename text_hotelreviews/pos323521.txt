we liked everything location is great green quiet corner easy access to public transportation but zero noise room was spacious everything was clean and tidy service was exceptional fast polite responsive and one can feel that personal is proud of their hotel and their city and of course the restaurant excellent innovative cuisine not only in the evening but breakfasts as well bottom line next time we ll be in amsterdam we will certainly stay here once more
