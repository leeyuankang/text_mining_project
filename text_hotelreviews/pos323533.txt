hotel close to amstel station so very easy to get into the centre and at the end of the day you can return to the relative peacefulness of where the hotel is situated the rooms are large industrial minimalist but have everything you need as has previously been stated the breakfasts are incredible you won t need anything else until the evening the hotel reception staff are amazing so very helpful and nothing is too much trouble
