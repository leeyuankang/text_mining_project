relaxed unstuffy quality hotel loved the modern style blended with comfort room was very spacious which became a home from home staff were very friendly and generally excellent breakfast and evening snacks in the lobby restaurant were very tasty and well presented a little out of the centre but this was great for a quiet haven amstel station and trams are close by for hoping into the centre or stadium will go back
