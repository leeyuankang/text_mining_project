breakfast was included and it is amazing actually the restaurant is pretty cool a bit on the expensive side the bed is very comfortable the decor is charming and contemporary not even a little bit noisy the amenities are great and it is super clean they were very accomodating with my needs to early check in and late check out it is already one of my favorite hotels in the city
