the best breakfast i had at a hotel the presentation and the taste were both amazing a bit more variety could have been nice but i thoroughly enjoyed every breakfast i had during the stay they had some of the best staff i encountered in any european countries too very friendly helpful and professional the room was spacious and clean with a touch of their unique design one of very few hotels that well deserve star rating
