the hotel is just superb with comfy and interestingly decorated rooms and great staff but its the breakfast that makes the hotel extra special the restaurant where we had breakfast is very nice romantic the quality of food is exceptional we also had a dinner there again very tasty and interesting menu and good service the metro train tram station is about minitues on foot which was not a problem city center is minutes away by metro excellent value for money
