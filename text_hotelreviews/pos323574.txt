we booked as a last minute idea wasn t even supposed to come to amsterdam read reviews and though will try it was absolutely amazing extended or days to staff was so nice and felt like they done extra mile for us atmosphere is relaxing and wonderful food so delicious even location wise pergect it s a bit out of busy part which i saw as a positive thing as not so loud min with underground to town or an hour slow walk which we so enjoyed too
