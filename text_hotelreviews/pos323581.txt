this hotel is from now of on my favorite the styling is insanely good they reception guys where so lovely and very easy going everything you see on the pictures is exactly the same no maybe even better the breakfast was delicious the room was awesome and a shout out to the cleaning staff everyone that passed by said good morning and was very nice also i was totally surprised in a good way that we had booked a late check out but around o clock we decided to leave so the receptionist was so kind to return the extra costs for the late check out i would love to stay in this hotel again
