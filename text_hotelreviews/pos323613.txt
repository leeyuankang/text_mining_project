these guys are amazing the hotel is brand new the receptionist spoke perfect english the rooms were decorated with good taste and very clean the cosmetics from the hotel were smelling very nice the breakfast is the best of all until now because they have a chef that cooks and not a free buffet the hotel is close to a metro station and you can buy permits from the reception they have their own underground guarded parking and it costs only euros per day
