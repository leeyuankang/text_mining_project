the architecture beautifully designed the staff were friendly engaging informative and helpful we enjoyed the fire the restaurant has the most exquisitely presented food cooked to perfection clearly the chefs are of the highest calibre fine dining of the highest standard the highlight of our stay we found this hotel quite unique as it was so modern and providing areas of relaxation we left early before breakfast on our last day and we were so very impressed that we were presented with a beautiful hot croissant and two pastries packed in a box with a coffee to take with us if we come back to amsterdam we will definitely stay at this hotel again
