this hotel opened recently and the staff all were so helpful and kind nothing was too much the hotel was perfect in terms of a short distance mins by train to the centre of amsterdam it was perfectly clean and staff were always cleaning the cost of a glass of wine in the bar was a little high but not too much the quality of food was fantastic in particular the breakfast both my wife and i look forward to returning
