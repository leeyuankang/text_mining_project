the staff were extremely helpful friendly and professional particular mentions for kieran at reception apologies if your version of the name is spelled differently monika at the bar in the lobby restaurant and a waiter from new zealand whose name i didn t get but who was very helpful in showing us some alternative areas and sites to visit i ll echo what others have already said about the breakfast menu it s absolutely brilliant and i love that everything is freshly cooked to order
