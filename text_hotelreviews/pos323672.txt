everything about this hotel is so stylish we thoroughly enjoyed our nights stay in hotel v excellent staff they greet you smile are very attentive to requests and gave us very helpful tips on local attractions and places to eat our breakfast was a la carte and when i requested for something vegetarian the chef created a delicious plate of grilled vegetables everyday different vegetables can t say more about the staff they do go the extra mile to please their guests good job the rooms are large mattress very comfortable and when we closed the windows hardly heard anything one of the best quality of sleep i ve had in hotels there is a bus stand right next to the hotel or a metro station at min walk direct connection to central station overall a very pleasant experience we will definitely go there again
