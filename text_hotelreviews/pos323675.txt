the hotel staff was so friendly and welcoming they treated us like long lost friends family the atmosphere and decor of the hotel is very classy yet relaxing one could find a cozy nook or private lounge area to enjoy meals or drinks very romantic the food was exquisite and abundant i have never had better breakfast then what they gave us each day we were there we became friends quickly with the wait staff and it was always a treat to see them for breakfast we felt like family we will definitely make it our mission to come back to visit hotel v again what a great place
