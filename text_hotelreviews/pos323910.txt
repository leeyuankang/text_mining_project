the location of the hotel was brilliant as it is so close to the major attractions you can walk everywhere and there are also quite a few good restaurants and cafes nearby the staff were wonderful and so helpful since it was my first time visiting vienna they organised transport to pick me up from the airport the room was clean and tidy i would definitely recommend this hotel
