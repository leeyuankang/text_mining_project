location is perfect in the heart of the old city center at the edge of very vivid tourist area it s a modernly decorated and comfortable hotel unlike most of others in that area standard service for star hotel not more not less it s right in the old centre of the town sightseeing shops and restaurants are just a few steps away but the hotel itself is in a very quiet street i liked complimentary coffee and tee in the room great for people who do not have much free time to spend in vienna but would like to make maximum out of it
