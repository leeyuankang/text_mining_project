the hotel is in a great location being very close to stefanplatz the room was generally comfortable and there was very little street noise we went with the recommendation of other reviews on here and didn t include breakfast in our rate that turned out to be a great decision as there are lots of great breakfast options nearby joma is particularly recommended
