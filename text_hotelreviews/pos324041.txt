the location was very quite and safe yet perfect for visiting all central areas of vienna all areas were within easy walking distance from the hotel eg the belvedere the naschmarkt the hofburg palace etc etc the staff were very professional especially reception staff and breakfast staff including the young italian lady responsible for the bar area the room was very well appointed and immaculately clean the bathroom was particularly well appointed on our arrival the gift of a kaiserhof sachertort was much appreciated and very tasty when we return to vienna we will certainly stay at the kaiserhof
