we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the room was large the bed was comfortable the bathroom was modern with a great shower the hotel has a large breakfast room and a buffet breakfast with an excellent selection of both hot and cold items the location is on a quiet street about a minute walk to the metro minutes to the central train station and minutes to central vienna but what really made this hotel special was johannes at the reception desk he was so pleasant and helpful he made us feel like welcome guests in his home
