a very nice hotel in central vienna our choice of room was a junior suite all of which are on the top floor and really quiet very well appointed the beds were comfy and the rooms are air conditioned and spacious the bathroom was large and well stocked with essentials had a powerful shower over a bath which is unusual to find it s more usual to have just a shower breakfast service was good with a wide variety on offer including hot options and as much as you wanted staff were helpful attentive knowledgable and kind we would have no hesitation in staying again if we are visiting vienna
