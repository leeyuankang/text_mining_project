i have travelled through europe extensively over the years and have stayed in mostly star hotels this hotel exceeded every expectation including superb rooms clean and comfortable beds bathrooms that worked flawlessly excellent staff including the friendliest front desk service staff and wait staff and an ambience and decor second to none the breakfast selection was of the highest quality with the best choice of coffees and an extensive range of food this is a clear star winner in my books and my day european vacation could not have ended in a more spectacular fashion thank you kaiserhof wien you gave me a sensational stay
