the kaiserhof is well located in a quiet side street about a minute stroll from the centre of town and the opera house the comfortable building is immaculately maintained with impeccable attention to detail our room was spacious thoughtfully equipped and competitively priced breakfast was a delight with lots of delicious viennoiseries as well as a cooked offer which changed daily and a generous assortment of fruits yoghourts etc but what makes the hotel exceptional is its staff knowledgeable helpful welcoming and genuinely charming they made everything about our stay easy not to mention giving dynamite recommendations for good places to eat we have already recommended this hotel to picky friends and would certainly stay again should we return to vienna and they have a well priced limo service to the airport
