the friendliest most helpful staff we ve ever encountered in a hotel and i travel all the time knowledgeable thoughtful and utterly charming not overly fancy but with wonderful touches that made our stay special warm and inviting highly recommended for a city visit conveniently located and within easy walking distance to so much excellent breakfast value for money
