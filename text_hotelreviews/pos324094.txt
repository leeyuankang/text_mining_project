i literally cannot fault this hotel the location was very central and we felt very safe walking around at night the staff were lovely and bent over backwards to help with any queries we had the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable the breakfast was incredible definitely the best i have had in any hotel i would return to the hotel for that alone
