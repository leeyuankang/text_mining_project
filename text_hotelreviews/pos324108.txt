the hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the sitting room for cocktails or tea then to the lovely breakfast room white table cloths but yet feel of informal for comfort i think this was the best breakfast ive had in any hotel i had a bad experience in italy before arriving i was pickpocketed and arrives in this hotel without any credit cards or money the staff was very helpful particularly corrine who was able to find the proper numbers for me to have cc sent to the hotel this took much pressure off my stay they also accommodated any of my needs due to my circumstances i will stay there again and in fact plan another trip soon just to enjoy this lovely hotel
