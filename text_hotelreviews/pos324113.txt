after traveling for four weeks in four countries in europe this hotel was my favorite i was nervous at first thinking that since it s a chain hotel that it wouldn t have charm but it was the opposite the staff was super friendly helpful and knowledgable i hope the manager realizes how professional and kind his staff is the breakfast as well as the restaurant staff was amazing it was healthy and fresh and had something for everyone the beds were the most comfy we slept in during our entire trip the bathrooms were also really nice the location is also really convenient thanks for a great stay we will be back did i mention that breakfast
