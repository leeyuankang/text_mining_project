excellent location small quiet street in the center of the city short walk to opera to albertina etc the room with the high ceiling was spacy enough there is a lot of preserved charm of old vienna and all the standard facilities like ac wi fi in the room and electric kettle the breakfast is rich and tasty most of the staff were helpful and nice my special thanks to ms laly at the reception that goes out of her way to help you another nice point is a free drink in the bar for the guests who stayed in this hotel previously
