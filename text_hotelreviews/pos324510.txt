we though it was a really good hotel for the value of money since we booked in advanced and the are is actually nice not far off at all it takes like an hour to walk to notting hill and to hyde park min u can take the bus right on the street outside or go down the rd to underground there are a wholefood store and others stores in the area the hotel had comfy beds we also asked for glasses of wine as we checked in that was no problem we did not have breakfast included there was an option for a breakfastplate but it seemed to cost more than what we would want for breakfast or there was a breakfastbuff served and that alone cost too much and there was a line so we went to megans and the imperial a few minutes away that i can recommend and also to caf es closer to the underground in fulham that had open for breakfast as well as in chealsea were we stopped for coffee on our walk to innercity good showers with pressure quiet room nr wo totally ok view
