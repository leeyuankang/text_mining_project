the fulham broadway tube is only a minute walk away it s in a great neighborhood full of places to shop and eat my room was very comfortable with lots of nice extras including a mini fridge and tea kettle the staff was all very nice overall a wonderful experience plus if you re into chelsea football you couldn t pick a better spot
