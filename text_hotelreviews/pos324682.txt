this hotel was very good room and hotel were really clean bathroom was big and clean staff was really helpful and smiling this hotel has also a good location easy access to public transport and quite close to all tourist things breakfast buffee was good but a bit expensive you find cheaper ones close by small minibar was complimentary i would recommend this hotel for short stays and people who wants to have good location and clean place couples business and elderly people
