located at the far end of chelsea fc as you walk from fulham broadway tube station which takes about mins the millenium and copthorne are actually separate hotels across a courtyard from each other both are well presented and the staff are welcoming we checked in at the copthorne but our twin room request had come through as a double so they upgraded us to a twin at the millenium the room was very clean with modern decor and bathroom breakfast was served in the restaurant back across the courtyard at the copthorne fairly typical selection of hot and cold buffet food including full english the service quality and cleanliness was very good
