nice room in a nice hotel though this was predicated upon an exceptionally low price i gained through booking com their walk in rack rate is very pricey as i overheard one of staff admit to a prospective guest interesting view over london even from this standard room which made a good start to a visit decent clean facilities excellent size and comfy bed and good staff
