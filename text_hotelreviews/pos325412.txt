the hotel is located in an amazing location right next to the main shopping street and minutes walk from the duomo there s literally no better location to stay in milan rooms were spacious but very old there is a strange walk in closet which is so not usable the bathroom was big and outdated and the bathtub was not comfortable at all to take a shower it is a narrow bath and the water tap is located at the narrow part of the bathtub making it extremely uncomfortable experience but again we were not so bothered by that after all cause you just simply take a quick shower the breakfast was great fresh ingredients good coffee fruits meats some vegetables and good selection of breads and croissants we could leave our luggage in their luggage storage and explore the city and came back after lunch to pick up our suitcase overall a great location value for money great breakfast and outdated but comfortable rooms
