super close to the shopping areas duomo di milano the staff is not too bad don t smile as much as i would like them to but really good enough for me to ask them questions with decent answers returning the porter is very helpful and responsible i did not have to carry the room keys around and there was a safety box in the room located in a galleria snugged away quietly from the main street nice people working in the breakfast place
