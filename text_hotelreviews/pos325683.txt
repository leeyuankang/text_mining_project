a really great hotel the staff was so nice and helpful our room was spacious and clean and they fulfilled our wish for an upper level room we had a huge bathtub and super comfortable beds what we loved the most though were the sound proof walls never got such good sleep in a hotel before i also really loved the location and environment a nice safe and atmospheric business district with a lot of water around and its only a minute walk to the metro we would certainly stay here again
