just returned home from a fabulous weekend with my daughter staying in crowne plaza amsterdam south close enough not to be in the huddle and bustle of things with excellent transport links made this an ideal location for us the hotel is situated in the business area of the city only a short walk from train and tram links station zuid the staff were extremely friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble to them our room on the top floor was immaculately clean and spacious with the little extras that crowne plaza hotels provide fantastic choices for breakfast enjoyed in the lovely canal side restaurant kept us going til late afternoon we enjoyed a cocktail each in the bar prepared by the very obliging barman in order to wind down after fitting in as much sight seeing as we were able we had prebooked our tickets for museums this is an absolute must unless you want to spend your precious time in massive queues would definitely recommend this hotel and will return next time visiting amsterdam
