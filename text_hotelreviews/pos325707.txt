most of the staff were amazing but experienced an incident where service was somewhat sub par in the bar and this is why i did not give staff perfect score i asked for blankets for outside and the bar tender told me he just put them away i wondered why he did not go and get them for us with that said the second night we visited the bar we had excellent service from different bar tender breakfast was delicious and the omelette chef was super friendly and made us laugh having the train and tram station next door is very convenient uber ride into the center is also very reasonable from the location i will stay at this hotel again
