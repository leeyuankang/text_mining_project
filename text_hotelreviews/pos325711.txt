the staff was very nice especially the waiters in the restaurant what by the way has some very tasty food this is one of the few places where every employee was welcoming with a few words and they seemed to be happy working there the rooms looked nice i loved the leather couch and the wallpapers the hotel in general looks nice and clean really can t say anything bad about it the wifi was surprisingly good
