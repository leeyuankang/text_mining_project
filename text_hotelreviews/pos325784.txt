had a great stay at the hotel woke up feeling rested the entire nights the bed and pillows were comfortable and despite being a hotel with many rooms i could hardly hear any noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms at night overall modern and clean facilities definitely value for money all the staff from the front desk restaurants and housekeeping were friendly yet professional a wonderful experience all in all
