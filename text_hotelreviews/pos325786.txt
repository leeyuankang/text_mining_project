very nice staff helpful and polite and the hotel is situated close to the zuid station you have only one stop to schipol airport further lines to join the city centre you can buy tickets at the reception desk without fees but the best is to rent their comfortable bikes and discover the city by bike it s just amazing the room was very nice with all the things you need to sleep well they even have little aromatherapy samples so you can slap lekker sleep well
