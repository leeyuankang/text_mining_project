we visited our family in amsterdam during christmas from the reception to the manager on duty to the cleaners everybody was exceptional each one of them took the extra mile to make us feel at home and so we felt this was our fifth visit to amsterdam and by far the best hotel we will definitely stay in the hotel again on our next visit it was special with sweet memories
