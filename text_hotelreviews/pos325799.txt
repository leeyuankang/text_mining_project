the hotel was just awesome especially the staff they were ready to render their services at any time special referral to the manager on the floor mr fischer who was active all the time the rooms and the food were excellent as well the hotel is good especially if you have work in vu medical centre because it is just min walk from the hotel to the city centre it takes at least min but well connected by the tram bus and metro
