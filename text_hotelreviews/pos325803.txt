from check in to check out the staff couldn t have been more helpful or welcoming it what is obviously a hotel that mainly deals with business people it was fantastic to have a young child and feel like we were just as welcome close to the station and comfortable walk to the museum quarter and some lovely parks the food and service in the manhattan bar was particularly good as was the morning breakfast team providing special toiletries for children was a nice touch too
