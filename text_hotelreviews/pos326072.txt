i love this hotel and stay here whenever i am in london it is like stepping back in time in the best possible way it is very charming beautifully furnished and has a delightful little bar and couple of small lounges which are very comfortable and cosy they serve a lovely afternoon tea and the breakfast is great the rooms are small but comfortable and it is always very clean and very well presented the location is superb a lovely minute wall from oxford street surrounded by great restaurants but is still very quiet and peaceful
