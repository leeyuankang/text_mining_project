the durrants hotel in marleybone is in an amazing location just behind the wallace collection the porter staff were excellent and helped look after us well including assisting with a very tight parking space the room was beautiful and well appointed and the bathrooms in great shape with nice amenities provided within it overall the hotel was really lovely with just a few snags that should be ironed out ultimately the location makes it great value for money
