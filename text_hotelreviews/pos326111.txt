durrants is perfectly located in central london it is a unique hotel with cosy antique filled public rooms starched table clothes and attentive but not oppressively so staff it is a delightful change from the standard branded hotels the bedroom was a good size and the bathroom clean and well stocked with toiletries the management are discreetly present so when for example the barman was busy a manager appeared as if from nowhere to ensure no one was left waiting service is always just the right balance of friendly but not familiar the hotel is near the wallace collection and within walking distance of many restaurants
