beautiful older hotel in an excellent location the staff were friendly and helpful because of the age of the building the bedroom was quite small the bathroom was larger but the shower and bath difficult for older guests very formal dining room for evening meals but excellent food attractive breakfast room but soft classical music would have improved the ambience for me
