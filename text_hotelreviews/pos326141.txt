the service of kitchen was appalling we had a meal in the evening and waited a very long time for a very mediocre meal food was lukewarm and soup tasted watered down without flavour waiting staff was friendly but untrained one redeeming feature was good dessert similar issues at breakfast waited minutes for poached eggs
