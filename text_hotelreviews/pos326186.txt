bed was very comfortable very traditional hotel we liked the d cor and the location all the staff were very professional and friendly nothing too much trouble we liked the bar area very atmospheric the whole hotel made such a pleasant change from the usual bland corporate rooms the whole hotel has character we loved having sheets and blankets rather than duvets the hotel is within easy walking distance of regent s street new bond street and the fantastic marylebone high street we would definitely stay again
