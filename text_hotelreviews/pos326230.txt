a simply delightful hotel with lots of little extra rather old fashioned touches which are lovely for instance silver coffee pot at breakfast with silver cruet set all laid out on clean linen no help yourself it s all brought to you to order someone to greet you when you come downstairs great wi fi nice smell of soap in the bathroom
