location of hotel was great wallace collection just around the corner fantastic worth a visit marlybone is a busy high street with numerous places to eat luckily as hotel is quite expensive staff were very friendly and accommodating we did have one meal in the hotel it was fabulous even though atmosphere was lacking as there was only one other guest eating old fashioned charm with plenty of comfy places to sit and relax
