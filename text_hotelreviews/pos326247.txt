i loved the look and feel of the hotel the staff were really helpful friendly and attentive it was a pretty quaint and had a pleasant traditional aesthetic the location was good for a night out in the centre of london especially if you wanted to go to the theatre and we got a very good deal on the price the whole hotel was clean and comfortable and the facilities were good
