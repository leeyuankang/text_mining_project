i would just like to say the reception staff was one of the best and is one of the main reasons i would stay at this hotel again sandra and her colleague were very welcoming helpful and always dealt with any of our questions enquiries in a very friendly professional manner the hotel is located near the market where you can find lots of places to eat and drink and a reasonable rate it is also near the opera house and a small walk away from the city centre and train stations
