did i mention great location mins walking to the city s biggest market opera musem quarter hofburg and one of the klimt paintings my darling s favourite just accross the street in secession house parking is not cheap day but reasonable for the location we got parking in the garage accross the street because the hotel s garage was full for the same price kind and helpful staff clean stayed in a suite so got a small kithen no kitchenware really but a real coffee machine and also a kettle to boil the water to make a tea liked that breakfast good plenty of choice maybe not as luxurious as i would expect from hotel but liked the price if it stays that way will stay here again
