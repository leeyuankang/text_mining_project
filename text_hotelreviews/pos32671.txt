the hotel has a great location very close to station tottenham court road only a two minutes walk away in the middle of a dynamic area of the city the check in went very smooth and the breakfast in the morning is very delightful as all is freshly prepared and you can choose from a very detailed breakfast menu the amenities in the bathroom as well as in the living room and the minibar menu are great good selections
