the location is ideal and very accessible it s close to shops and restaurants i like that it s close to tottenham court road and goodge street stations it was also quiet which lends much to comfort the room and bed linens were clean very close to the british museum and oxford street breakfast was great and the pastries and bread from gail s bakery are excellent staff were very friendly and helpful
