we both loved the room and especially the comfortable bed the room was both modern and well air conditioned bathroom shower was superb staff were superb and will give you the best advice for getting around pool was just enough to cool down with a nice enough view drinks are served to the pool area breakfast catered enough variety for both of us the free mini bar was great no alcohol though hotel staff advised us to get the ticket for the metro best thing we bought for getting around for a few euros we loved the modern boutique feel to this hotel and felt very welcomed every time we set foot in the building highly recommended
