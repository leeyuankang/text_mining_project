i would stay again and again at this hotel it s the perfect location near public transport and in walking distance to many attractions bars restaurants shopping opportunities etc but in a not touristy street the rooms are exactly what you need for a stay in the city clean very comfortable bed tasteful design the staff was super friendly and always ready to help and a very nice bonus is the rooftop terrace with a small pool where you can relax after a busy day of sightseeing perfect stay
