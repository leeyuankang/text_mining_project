service was lovely especially the guy who checked us in we had some problems with our australian credit card and he was nothing but friendly and patient throughout the room was beautiful even though it was small it had everything we needed the bed was incredibly comfy loved the ambience of the lobby and the afternoon tea would definitely stay again if we are back in barcelona location might be a little out depending on what you are there to do but we found it fine especially as the verdaguer metro station exit is about away
