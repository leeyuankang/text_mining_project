the staff seemed to be able to accommodate guests in what ever language they spoke i heard staff speaking english french german spanish catalan they probably could speak more they gave us great recommendations for restaurants every night breakfast was great the hotel was a short taxi ride or bus ride away from the cathedral and gruell park which is what i wanted to see we were also able to walk to see an apartment building designed by gaudi the bed was comfortable the room was not spacious but it was comfortable
