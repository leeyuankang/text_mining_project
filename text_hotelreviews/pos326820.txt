fantastic hotel right in the center of all the major sights of barcelona easy to get to from the airport via the metro about minutes rooms were spacious i had originally booked a room with a terrace but found it a little too dark so moved to another room that faced the street with a balcony beautiful room with an amazing shower and facilities the welcome drink was much appreciated and the cost of drinks at the bar was very reasonable
