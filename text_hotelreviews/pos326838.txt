free kit kat everyday free tea and nespresso coffee pods in the room free welcome cava room was larger than we had expected it was very comfortable and also quiet for a city centre location staff were completely amazing and friendly they helped us with lots of queries recommendations and booking tickets the same price as booking yourself but better because the hotel can print and guarantee them they even let us have a late check out on the last day when i was very unwell location was excellent we walked everywhere except guell park and mount tibidabo which are too far for walking really the roof terrace was lovely it was calm and peaceful with comfortable sun loungers and a view of mount tibidabo one night we decided to watch netflix on the roof wifi was excellent in our pyjamas the lovely reception lady brought us wine and a duvet it was my favourite night in barcelona we didn t try the breakfast as the booking com price was too expensive but if you book directly with the hotel it was half the price so worth remembering for another time there is a bakery next door which was super cheap
