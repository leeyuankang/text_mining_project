this hotel is a minute walk to the underground buy a ticket for value it is about minutes walking to sagrada familia in one direction and same to gaudi s apartments in another it felt more residential which we liked yet easy reach of any attractions the hotel is boutique which makes it most welcoming reception was extremely helpful the recommended tapa restaurant was really good and given its popularity we guessed we were sent to a good spot while our room had no view it was extremely quiet which we appreciated the daily snacks and drinks were an added bonus we didn t use the breakfast room or bar there are plenty of options for meals and supplies in close proximity highly recommend this hotel
