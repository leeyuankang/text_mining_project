this is a really nice place to stay in barcelona friendly and helpful staff greet you at the desk on arrival the room we had was very comfortable with great facilities and we slept extremely well best sleep in a long time the roof top area is a very nice place to relax in the sun on the loungers with a nice little pool to cool off in the hotel must be quite new as all facilities are in excellent condition and very modern also it has a handy location min walk to sagrada familia it s right next to a metro station and is an easy walk to other places in barcelona i would definitely recommend a stay here
