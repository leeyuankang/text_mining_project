good use of room space everything was there that you needed complimentary welcome drink complimentary soft drinks in fridge staff were extra friendly and helpful to visiting places in the city fantastic pool and lounging area on the roof terrace and this was open until midnight which was a welcome relief after a day of sight seeing would definitely recommend and visit again
