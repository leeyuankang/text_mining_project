the hotel is newly built and so looks and feels fresh very helpful reception staff particularly victor who was very helpful with transport info and local restaurants hotel few mins walk from a metro station so getting about very easy the room was very clean and made up to a high standard each day always quiet in and outside the hotel during our stay the hotel was offering a free mini bar in the room which was nice there is a supermarket next door which is useful would definately stay again
