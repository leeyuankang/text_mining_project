loved the complementary mini bar in the room modern building beautiful sun terrace with a gorgeous swimming pool and nice view breakfast was good appreciated the smoked salmon air conditioning worked a treat something you don t always get in spanish hotel rooms in april minute walk to the sagrada familia subway station right next to it bus stop with the night line running though placa catalunya to the ocean port parking is right next to the building at a reasonable price definitely recommend
