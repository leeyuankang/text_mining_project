hotel staff were wonderful and very helpful rooms were obviously newly done and tastefully so loved the shower comfortable bed beds are so often rock hard in europe and adorable juliette balcony the breakfast was also quite tasty and always fresh right up until the end wifi was strong and easy to connect to
