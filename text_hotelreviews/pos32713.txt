spacious funky suite with comprehensive equipment large tvs apple mac good minibar overall a modern state of the art hotel great for young people we were much older than the average guests who looked like google employees close to bm and tottenham court road station but our room looked out on a quiet roofscape there was a private terrace which would be great in summer
