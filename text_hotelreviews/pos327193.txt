excellent location blocks from aerobus stop block from montserrat metro line and all the other metro lines block from a tourist info stop and a hop on hop off bus stop just off placa de espanya and a short walk from the montjuic fountains there is a mall just about two blocks away with many restaurants and stores and if you re thinking of getting tickets to la sagrada familia buy them early at the tourist info stop
