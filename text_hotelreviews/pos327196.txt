it was in a great location for public transport our room was huge and we had a great view the staff were so lovely and helpful we arrived on my friends birthday and when we returned to our room we found a dessert waiting for her with a happy birthday note it was such a lovely gesture and definitely put this in the top places we have stayed the chicken tenders from the menu are also amazing the bar prices were so affordable and the staff were very nice loved the quick euro breakfast options
