i enjoyed very much my stay in this hotel the location of which is just great it will take you just min to get to the hotel from the airport using the aerobus get off at plaza espana and walk meters you will see the entrance to the ayre gran via hotel i highly recommend this accommodation because of its location being close to all the sightseeings of barcelona you can start from plaza espana itself the room was spacious and very comfortable including good bathroom with a spacious shower and very comfy bed while booking this hotel i didn t include breakfast into my stay as my friends and i were traveling to other cities almost everyday we had our train early in the morning but on the day of departure we added a breakfast which costed us euros and included a big variety of dishes to choose from you can find the coffee you like even for nespresso lovers there is a nespresso coffee machine drink freshly squeezed orange juice enjoy jamon spanish ham cheeses and other cold cuts as well as warm dishes and variety of fruits and pastries in a nutshell this hotel is highly recommended it s a true value for money if i come to barcelona again i ll definitely stay at this hotel
