the location of the hotel just a block away from plaza espana and very convenient to the barcelona metro which makes getting anywhere in barcelona you wanted to visit extremely easy the hotel was easily within walking distance to visit the montju c area the hotel was very clean and quiet all of the staff were very helpful and pleasant the tv had english channels but may require some setup the staff responded very quickly to assists us in getting to the english channels good size room and nice bathroom we loved granja la tassa a little cafe bar a couple blocks near the hotel on gran via which has the best tortilla espanola we have ever had
