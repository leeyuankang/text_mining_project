really everything about the hotel is what you would wish for staff were great that you could leave your car in a secure and safe garage if you stay at the hotel before leaving on a cruise they will look after your car we left it for days we collected it without any problems and the staff were so helpful they even helped us with our cases from the entrance to the garage even if you book through booking com they will take your telephone request about the car if you speak to them direct great reception staff and so very helpful really recommend this hotel for anyone travelling on a cruise the cruise terminal is only a short taxi ride away also the hotel easily located and found as it is on the grand via
