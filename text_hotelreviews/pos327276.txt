i loved this hotel located beside pla a d espanya where you can get transport into the centre although i just walked pla a d espanya is also a drop off and pick up point for the airport coach i had a lovely room overlooking the street and there was no noise food was really good and the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel is just round the corner from the magnificent font m gica de montju c magic fountain and you can walk up past it to get to the olympic stadium and palau sant jordi concert arena
