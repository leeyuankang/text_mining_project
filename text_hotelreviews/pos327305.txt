rooms were lovely bathroom was great and very modern i was not expecting it to be as nice as it was as we got it fairly cheap great stay also good area right by the magic fountain subway easy connection to city centre and all the other main attractions also the airport shuttle bus stops very very close to hotel so there is no walking round a place you don t know looking for your hotel was very easy to get to
