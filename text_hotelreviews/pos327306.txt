i stayed in the junior suite room with my girlfriend the room was simply amazing it had a great view a lot of space and a beautiful bathroom the staff was really nice and allowed us to check in earlier they also told us that we could have the drinks in the minibar of the room for free the location is perfect just minutes away from the metro station and the magic fountains i would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to everyone tip ask for a room on a high floor in order to have a nice view
