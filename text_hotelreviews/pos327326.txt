the location was ideal and it was a pleasant place to stay the breakfast was lavish and the staff was very helpful however the pillows were most uncomfortable and the quilt was not clean we got free water for the first day however the staff did not exchange the sparkling water bottles for still water even upon our request otherwise the location makes it an ideal place to stay
