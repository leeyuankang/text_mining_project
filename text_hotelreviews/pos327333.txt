the breakfast buffet is huge full of options for anything you would like to eat fabulous place to stay for any american s who have not traveled around spain much this place was the most americanized location we stayed in wider spaces and a large shower noticed the hotel parking is immediately adjacent to the hotel although we did not make use of it rooms are incredibly quiet even thought we had a window facing the very busy main thoroughfare through the city great location for walking to olympic areas and not terribly far for a walk to the ramblas the beach the zoo everything touristy that barcelona has to offer staff if suuuuper friends and helpful
