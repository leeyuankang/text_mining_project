my husband and i had a wonderful stay the staff were lovely and the facilities were first rate we particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet it offered enormous choice and excellent quality in addition i would also like to thank the hotel staff for facilitating our trip to sagrada familia we had not booked in advance so did not manage to get in to the basilica at the beginning of our holiday we subsequently discovered that the hotel could help and needed two days notice to book us on a tour the service was brilliant and enabled us to go to the fabulous church on our last day i really can t recommend this hotel enough my husband and i are already planning a return trip to barcelona and can t wait to stay there again
