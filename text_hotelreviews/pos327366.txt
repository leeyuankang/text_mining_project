great location right at plaza espanya metro link to everywhere the airport bus stops walk away breakfast great everything you could need buffet for cereal etc but hot food ordered and served to you fresh rooms large and comfortable just missed having tea coffee facilities would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again
