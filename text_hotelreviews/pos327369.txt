it was a celebration of my birthday with my family on arrival we were promptly allocated our rooms my daughters had arranged for a bottle of bubbly in the room olives and nibbles were given as extras the room was very clean and modern with plenty of cupboard space the bed was large and comfy and we all found the rooms very quiet with no noise heard from corridors or other rooms at all we paid extra to have the breakfast and couldn t have been more pleased there was a large selection of food and we were more than happy with it it also helped that breakfast was served until as we had a couple of late evenings the metro was just around the corner and the reception staff were more than happy to book taxis if needed they were also easy to hail from outside the hotel
