the staff went over and above my expectations especially when i got sick for example they gave me the contents of their first aid kit to treat a burn i had before i arrived when i ended up with a stomach ailment they gave me extra water and more bottled water the room itself was spacious with an amazing bathroom the bed was very comfortable even though the hotel is not close to the center of the city it is close to many stores restaurants and some land marks i appreciated the fact that the hotel was close to the arenas where there s a food court and a grocery store also the airport bus stops a block from the hotel
