location was excellent aerobus shuttle from airport stopped yards up the road and the espanya metro station was yards away la ramblas and nou camp are only stops away so the journey time to those places is only a few mins port olympic is only a taxi fare away staff were very helpful and spoke excellent english they were happy to deal with any requests room was very nice and very clean minibar was free there s also a hour shop next door
