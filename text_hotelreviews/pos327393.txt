comfortable bed and very clean room bed was made up fresh everyday lots of little extras in the room great sized room mini suite very friendly staff who made us feel welcome from the minute we entered the hotel range of food was excellent and they would also cook something different for you if there was nothing in the buffet for you to eat excellent base to get to all parts of barcelona either by foot bus or train tourist bus is a good way to see the city stops a couple of hundred metres away from the hotel
