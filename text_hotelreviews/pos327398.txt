staff were really friendly and never had any problem with answering queries about barcelona and getting around etc the location of the hotel was excellent right next to the metro which made it really quick to get around barcelona and see everything with ease which was excellent as this was our first time in barcelona they even stored our bags for us after check out until our flight home which made life easier on our final day would definitely recommend staying here
