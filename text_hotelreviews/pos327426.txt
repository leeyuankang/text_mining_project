stayed for days for my partners the staff were amazing and so helpful with every request they had a bottle of cava waiting in the room on our arrival and even let us check in early the hotel is very central with the metro very close by so getting around barcelona is easy the hotel itself is very clean and all rooms have wifi couldnt recommend this hotel more
