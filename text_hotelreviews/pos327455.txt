good location aerobus stop just two mins from hotel metro station plaza espanya mall arenas ten min walk to magic fountain museo nacional de arte if you are going just for a couple of days i will recomend you to buy two days on the turist bus one stop in plaza espanya walk from the hotel and will be easy to move around all the turist places
