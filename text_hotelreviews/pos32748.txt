very good location in a quiet side street to the more busy neighbouring area clean room and a very good bed short walk to the nearest subway positively surprised by this small hotel and a good alternative to the large business oriented hotels has lots of charm and good service good quality breakfast being served continental or full english are available and is served to the table nice location of a quality bakery cafe behind the reception area overall a good place to stay and i will come back
