from the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and cheerful it was only a short walk with our cases from the station and also very near the metro the room was very big and very comfortable and the breakfast was tremendous there were many choices of meats and breads and cooked dishes overall it was what made our stay in barcelona even more rewarding definitely worth doing again
