the location of the hotel was excellent and close to a few cafes for breakfast las ramblas and the universitat metro station and bus stop decent walking distance to the gothic quarter and the open air market from sunotel central we could be anywhere in the city within minutes the staff was very friendly and accommodating and the rooftop pool was small but pleasant
