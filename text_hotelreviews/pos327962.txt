the airport shuttle bus goes past the hotel it was a very hot day when we arrived and the aircon was excellent we were on the floor and we had a balcony that overlooked the gran via but it wasn t noisy because there were double doors there is a small pool upstairs and an area to sit the staff were very helpful and there are lots of places nearby to eat and the bus stop to return to the airport is only a short walk away
