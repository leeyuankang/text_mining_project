our stay was very comfortable at sunotel central the hotel was incredibly conveniently located very close to the centre with a clean room and a reasonable sized room the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay and were able to answer any querie we had we really liked the addition of the rooftop pool there s little else close to the centre that offers a pool or anywhere to sunbathe other than the beach which is a taxi ride away the pool was quiet and relaxing as well as clean
