i stayed here in february with my sister and again the bed and pillows are extremely comfortable the staff friendly and helpful and would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues the small roof terrace with pool and jacuzzi are a bonus and enjoyed a couple of late afternoons in the sun
