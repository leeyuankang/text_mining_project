we had the luck to get a great deal i can t express how happy we were with our deal incredible value for money that i am going to remember for a long time carlos at the reception was great from check in through check out the room was extremly clean and had a very posh feeling jacuzzi spa area open for guests until in fact we even decided to stay in for the evening after having dinner to do the sight seeing the day after that s a good rating for a hotel room many thumbs up to the shower that was amazing coffe was a nespresso machine with capsules instead of the normal instant coffee with a water boiler the location was only from plc catalunia where you could find hoho bus stops that takes you sightseeing through the city there are nerby supermarkets as well as cervecerias bars and restaurants this was the best stay of our euro trip with days in a row on different hotels every night so far
