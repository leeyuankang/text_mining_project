the hotel location is absolutely perfect there is a starbucks right around the corner universitat metro station is a one minute walk plaza catalunya is a minute walk with another closeby metro station that connects the whole city and it is a perfect place to take wonderful pictures with the pigeons and catch a city bus tour plenty of yummy neighborhood cafes for coffee and breakfast gran via de les cortes catalan the street where the hotel is located cuts through barcelona and almost everywhere in barcelona except for the mountains is a walk from the hotel the metro rides are a maximum of minute trip the farthest the front desk staff are the most courteous and efficient that i have ever encountered and i travel a lot the lobby gives the impression that the hotel is small but i was surprised and impressed with how spacious the rooms are cleanliness level is great the cleaning schedule is also great i came back to find my room perfectly cleaned every single day and regardless of the time i left the hotel was this hotel expensive yes was it worth what i paid also yes great complimentary coffee in the room
