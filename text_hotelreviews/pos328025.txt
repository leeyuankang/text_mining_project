very comfy bed very friendly and helpful staff we moved room to the back of the hotel because of traffic noise from the road and it was very quiet we did not have breakfast but there are many cafes and bars nearby very good location as you can reach the old town and the new easily on foot also there are buses and metro nearby if you need it caught the train to sitges for a day out well worth it
