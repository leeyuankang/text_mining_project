getting to the hotel from the airport was a breeze using the airport shuttle bus a a cost of euros the hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them we even got a complementary bottle of cava on our arrival as it was my friends birthday a lovely touch thank you sunotel the pool and jacuuzzi are open all year round so pack your cozzi we would stay here again without a moments hesitation
