staff excellent and helpful location very near to universitat metro station bus stop exactly outside the hotel entrance cleanliness and facilities are excellent we went in november it was cold so couldn t use swimming pool but we did use jacuzzi good value for money if we visit barcelona again we would definitely stay here again
