the location is as the hotel name suggests very central i had a room on street side on the floor and even though you can hear the traffic or the youth hanging about outside it did not bother me as i am used to city noises and it s not that bad the room is basic but neat and clean and nothing was broken the tv people complained about is small indeed but if you go on holiday to watch tv the problem is with you i never even touched the tv
