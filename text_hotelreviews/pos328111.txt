great location walking distance from central catalunya square and plenty of bars and restaurants near by we didn t really use the metro but there university at station is a block away also a short walk from la rambla lovely roof terrace with pool and the jacuzzi is heated which went down a treat when the temperature dropped in the evenings the roof terrace has bathrooms with lots of fresh towels to use around there the rooms are dated but nice and clean the walk in shower was great very powerful with numerous heads and settings
