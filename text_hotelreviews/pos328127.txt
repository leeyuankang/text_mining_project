the location is excellent our room was surprisingly quite spacious given the general size of rooms you d expect for the price hotel is clean and reception is open staff were pleasant and efficient the roof top pool although small is a good option for relaxing at the beginning end of the day with plenty of towels and loungers we d have no problem staying here again if back in barcelona in the future
