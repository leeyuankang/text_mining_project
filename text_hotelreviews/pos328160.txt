the hotel location was very good we were a few blocks from casa batllo in one direction and las rambalas in the other and very close to a metro for the further places the room was simple clean and very nice we didn t have breakfast so no idea about the food but pool was nice smaller then it looks in photos but we did enjoy it for one afternoon we would recommend this hotel
