location is superb right next to plaza de catalunya close to tourist buses and just mins away from la rambla neighbourhood is full of small caffes restaurants starbucks and small bistros are in the same street staff was really helpfull and gave us many useful information regarding tourist sites and attractions room was ok clean and well maintained cleaning ladies did a great job breakfast was good but way too expensive eur pers not worth it and they served it from am too late swimming pool is situated on the top floor but opens just after am until pm which we found too late as we are early risers you can t even sit on the terrace outside these hours because it s locked
