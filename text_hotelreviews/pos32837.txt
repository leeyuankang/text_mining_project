great location with fairly well sized room for london standards the hotel has a small reception without concierge and has a lift the room included complimentary water a coffee machine kettle and fridge we had a cot available for our year old with adequate space left in the room for our luggage there are lots of places to eat nearby with the tube being close also would stay here again
