the location is very good away from the hustle and bustle of la rambla in addition the room was spacious meticulously cleaned every morning and all towels and toiletries replaced we were on the club lounge floor and though a coffee machine is not present as advertised the pastries offered were of good quality the infused water at reception was a refreshing bonus
