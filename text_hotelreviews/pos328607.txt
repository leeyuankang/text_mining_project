this is the second time i have stayed at the havana with its very friendly and helpful staff ideal location and really nice facilities including the restaurant which serves very good food la rambla passeig de gr cia gaud s la pedrera casa batll la sagrada familia and even the beaches are within walking distance some walks being longer than others if walking to places like the gran teatre del liceu and the tablao cordob s for flamenco is too far then there are taxis waiting outside the hotel for ease of transport public transport is also nearby the havana is a lovely hotel and one that i would definitely recommend for a trip to this wonderful city
