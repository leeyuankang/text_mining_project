the bed was the comfiest bed ever very large the only down side was that we struggled to get up in the morning the hotel is beautiful in a really central location to explore the city very close to all the main shops loads of places to eat drink nearby also in walking distance to many sights including the sagradia familia we stayed in a superior double room which was lovely there were pastries fruit lollipops chocolates available to us free of charge in the hallway we had a wonderful stay would definitely recommend this fab hotel
