stayed at this hotel for days for my birthday was promised a compliment bottle if cava but didn t get it wanted ice bucket and glasses sent to the room but was told there was going to be a charge which was ridiculous they need to put irons in all the rooms as ordering via room service was a mission since they didn t speak english
