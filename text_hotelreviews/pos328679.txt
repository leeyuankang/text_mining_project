the staff were very friendly the rooms were comfortable and the hotel is well situated and only a to minute walk to the city centre we didn t get the opportunity to try the restaurant as we dined out with friends and family who live in barcelona but the restaurant looked very nice our room had a balcony with a small table two chairs and two sun beds it s just a pity it wasn t sunny enough to make full use of them
