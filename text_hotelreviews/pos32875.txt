this is my second stay at myhotel bloomsbury and each time i love it even more the hotel has a comfortable cozy feel to it and great staff the staff are really really attentive and polite i am a fan of the bloomsbury area and this hotel is perfect for it the location is great a couple of minutes walking to the british museum and the great restaurants on charlotte street covent garden the west end oxford street and so many more nice areas are also nearby the area is also well connected as there are numerous bus stops as well as tottenham court road station which is a few minutes away also an added plus is that upon reaching the lobby area in the morning you re greeted by the beautiful coffee aroma coming from gails bakery on the ground floor and a gorgeous array of pastries that are hard to resist
