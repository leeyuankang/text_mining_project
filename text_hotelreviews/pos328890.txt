absolutely oozing with style and character the hotel s location is central and sagrada famille is a short and scenic walk away our room was smaller than we expected but perfectly formed my friend and i loved the terraces and utilised both of them during our stay cotton house staff are warm and accommodating our stay was to celebrate my birthday so we wanted something with the x factor and this hotel certainly delivers we especially want to thank alonso gabriel sara laura mercure younes and alejandro who were exceptionally sweet to us and ensured our trip was extra special gracias
