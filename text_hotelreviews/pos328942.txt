as hotel prices in bcn have skyrocketed for the summer this hotel is good value especially for the location we had a twin room which was quite roomy for twin beds a desk chairs a huge walk in shower and even a little balcony all great the pool was very tiny and a bit disappointing but with the beach not far it was acceptable the location is perfect walking distance to all my top neighbourhoods i m a frequent visitor ramblas eixample el born and even not that long a walk to the beach if you re inclined to take the scenic route about minutes many many restaurants and bars very near by to fit all budgets the staff was friendly and helpful although some of the hotel policies seem to cut corners perhaps emblematic of vueling itself no bell staff from about to so if you need anything like towels or an iron you have to go fetch it we didn t try the restaurant or bar with so many fantastic places in bcn to check out
