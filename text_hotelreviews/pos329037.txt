lovely hotel easy to find and the location which is close to the city but just enough out of it for a bit of quiet although it is in a bysy street tye room was incredibly quiet so much so that we slept in on mire than one occasion the sangria at the local bar was the best we had in barcelona staff at the vueling were very friendly helpful plus made great recommendations for dinner gracias
