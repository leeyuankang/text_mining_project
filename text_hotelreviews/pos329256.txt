the staff were very accommodating of my requests and even went the extra mile to make me feel special on my birthday i had the most amazing and relaxing massage would definitely recommend a trip to the spa the room was neat tidy and spacious enough the hotel itself is a minute walk to placa catalunya which is extremely convenient and it s by a road which has a lot of taxi s that drive through so was easy to grab one to go to where i needed to really loved the location
