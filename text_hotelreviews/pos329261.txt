the location was great less than minutes from the airport with no traffic and walking distance to las ramblas and shopping mall the suite was reasonable size and clean the extra half bath in the living room area was convenient for me being that i was with my teenage daughters they loved the selfie mirror in their bathroom the breakfast buffet was consistently good with enough choices for my vegan daughter to leave satisfied they had fresh fruits and at least one meatless dish every morning they also had soy milk
