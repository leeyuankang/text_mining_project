staff where very friendly and couldn t do enough to help us the room was clean and cleaned every day roof top bar and plunge pool was fab although a little expensive but what do you expect for a hotel with this in mind the hotel bar had no problem opening opening our shop brought wine and providing glasses there is a metro station just down the road and if you need taxis the hotel reception will call one for you the bus stop to and from the airport is also just round the corner less than a min walk away
