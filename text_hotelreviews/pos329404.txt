the ambiance of this rather grand looking place was very welcoming and the location for exploring barcelona was excellent the options for restaurants and tapa bars near by were great the roof top pool and bar service were nice although we didn t use it except to enjoy the views of the city our room had a good sized bathroom with double sinks almost unheard of in a hotel
