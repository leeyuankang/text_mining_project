we were pleasantly surprised with the generous size of our very clean queen room we were expecting a small european type room so it was a pleasant surprise we had a city view with large windows that opened the bathroom was great rain shower head and hand held very nicely tiled with new fluffy towels the location is perfect it is surrounded by many designer stores shops cafe and restaurants we felt that the hotel was a great value for a city hotel
