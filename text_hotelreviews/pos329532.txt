we were upgraded to a suite tho we were only staying one night we arrived early due to early disembarkation from a cruise ship unfortunately they were full so unable to check in tho they did store our bags it would have been nice if coffe tea water had been available in the lobby we needed an american type electrical outlet for our phones and the desk was able to provide one for us we had some difficulty printing out our plane tickets and some one was available to assist us
