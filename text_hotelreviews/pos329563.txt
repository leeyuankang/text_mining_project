we were delighted with the hotel the room was lovely and comfortable with a great view i couldn t wait to head to the roof top when night fell the view of barcelona with the sunset and the night lights was stunning the breakfast was the best and most beautifully served we experience in our day trip my husband left his cane at home and they worked to help us get it replaced my thanks to them
