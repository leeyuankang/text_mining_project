hotel is in a fantastic location for all sightseeing or generally enjoying barcelona ideally located for ramblas beach shopping etc we were able to check in early which was a big help as we only had one night in barcelona during a holiday in salou the rooftop view is just incredible and the pool is really nice with jacuzzi jets massively recommend
