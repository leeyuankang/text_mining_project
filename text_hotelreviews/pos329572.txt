very well suited to singles traveling together and sharing a room which was spacious and had closets much larger than standard euro hotel rooms bathroom was spacious and modern large fully enclosed shower i e no water mess on floor to contend with double vanity plenty of counter space backlit large mirror room itself was an odd contrast felt very dated compared to bath with aged wood furniture and hardwood floors but still clean and functional and plenty of room for single gals and their luggage decent sized mini bar that accommodated refrigeration of personal items ac worked very well directly across street from metro which is also a negative if you re a light sleeper walking distance to many attractions and easy metro bus ride to others business center with free computers printing rooftop bar and pool were small but very nice for lounging and great view of city grocery pharmacy just a few blocks away felt very safe walking around at all hours of day and night staff were polite but not overly helpful did not eat at hotel so can t comment on restaurant
