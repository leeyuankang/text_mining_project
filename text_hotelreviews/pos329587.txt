the facilities were great with the pool and bar on the roof top what was a mini paradise and the skyline view was beautiful we had a room with a view onto the city the rooms had a soundproof window system and we slept great the cleaning staff were always busy quick and kind the atmosphere had a relaxed vibe although the hotel would be percived as posh it has the look however the atmosphere was perfect the location was probably the best you can get being inbetween both shopping paradises and easy to navigate the other guests varied from families to couples and everyone always seemed to be having a good time in full comfort also close to the airports bus service meant we were dropped a min walk away helping us save some money
