the rooftop pool and lounge area were perfect and provided degree views of the city the bed was changed daily and fresh towels provided daily also the air conditioning in the rooms gave some relief from the afternoon heat we didn t dine in the restaurant but the food smelled great so close to la rambla and so many other attractions right across from a great metro station that you can get to anywhere you want to go
