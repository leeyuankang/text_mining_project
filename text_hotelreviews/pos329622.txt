the description of the bedrooms on your site is so so wrong you state rooms are carpeted soundproof please visit room not sure if this is correct but was floor room was drab no carpet and defnintley not soundproof people banging doors kids screaming etc uncomfortable single beds pushed together we asked for a double on our booking plus a quiet room which of course as soon as you get into the bed they move view was the back of hotel not pretty
