i chose this hotel because of the reasonable price on booking com i wanted the convenience of the city but didn t really care about being in a luxury hotel wow it was very grand and luxurious the location was amazing i wouldn t have asked to be any closer to placa catalunya and the conveniences of the city when i had a problem in my room the first night water dripping from shower above and toilet running when upstairs toilet was flushed the night manager was extremely helpful and apologetic nothing could be done at that moment due to the time of day and full bookings but the following morning they moved me to a luxurious suite on the floor with a beautiful corner balcolny overlooking the city and mountains they went above an beyond to ensure i was taken care of as a single female traveler i never felt i was unsafe the amount of staff in the lobby and the key system meant that someone was always aware of my departure and return english was spoken fairly well by the front staff the roof top pool and bar loungers and view were truly amazing i honestly have nothing negative to say about my stay
