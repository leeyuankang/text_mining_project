good location near a gaudi house the northern end of la rambla with restaurants and the placa catalyuna very good bathroom with tissues and a nice rain shower the breakfast was excellent with very good waiter service the breakfast offerings changed each day we had quiet rooms in the back of the hotel hotel lobby and breakfast room are very well decorated the hotel offers printer services for free very helpful because many attractions in barcelona require printouts of tickets
