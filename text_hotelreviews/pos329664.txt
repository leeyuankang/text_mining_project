due to a flood problem in my room prior to my arrival the hotel could not accommodate me for the first night but they provided for me to stay at a nice nearby hotel and they upgraded me for the second night i was very satisfied with the way they handled this issue the front desk staff are nice and polite the location is perfect very central and close to pla a catalunya and casa batll
