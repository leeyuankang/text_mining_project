we booked this hotel at the last minute and got a great deal the hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location for exploring barcelona we sat on the rooftop by the pool mid afternoons and could look across the whole of the city to plan our trip for the next day loved having the pool even though it s small it s just perfect wifi was great for us in both our rooms
