the location was the best in barcelona in the city center but just off the main street so it was quiet small but well appointed comfortable room would stay again in a heartbeat i would not eat there again room service was mediocre but at least did the trick when we were too tired from traveling to leave the room in short walking distance to many of the best restaurants and attraction in the city
