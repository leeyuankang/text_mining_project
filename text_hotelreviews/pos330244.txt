the front desk staff headed up by zen were amazing as always extremely polite welcoming and accommodating we were allowed a late checkout no problem at all and our return flight boarding passes they printed out for us anything ordered to the room was there almost immediately great breakfast too the hotel is central to the city and conveniently located for shopping and sightseeing i have stayed here many times over the last years and have tried other hotels in barcelona but this hotel has become my firm favourite and coming back here feels like coming home
