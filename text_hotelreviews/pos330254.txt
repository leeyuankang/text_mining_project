this hotel is well situated on the main road but once inside you are in a quiet space we had the room at the back of the building no view but quiet the spa area is good very refreshing to be able to just jump into the pool even in the evening it s open until breakfast is great the shared areas look good but the rooms are in need of an update the family room which we booked could be a bit bigger with adults and a toddler it was crowded if you asked my toddler he would give this hotel a top rating
