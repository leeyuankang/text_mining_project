really enjoyed my stay here the room was very nice and cozy with the looks of a star hotel the staff were also very friendly and helpful it is really close to la ramblas which was very convenient as most shops and restaurants were located nearby min walk from zara getting there from the airport was easier than expected too as i only had to take the airport bus to the terminal station and walk a few mins overall i would love to come to this beautiful city again
