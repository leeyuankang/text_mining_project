i honestly never write reviews for the places i stay in but my stay with atrium palace was so perfect my friends and i were adamant we had to write a review the hotel staff were amazing and extremely helpful we were only in barcelona for the weekend so we asked them for places to eat and where to go moises helped us find our way around the location was perfect it was on a quieter street to la ramblas but everything was within walking distance it was probably a minute walk to the aerobus which takes you straight to the airport all attractions are close by from sagrada familia to local parks the only place you will probably have to travel a little extra for is park guell i could not recommend this hotel enough the extra touches in the room walking us out to the taxi under an umbrella to hour room service ordered pizza in the morning also on the sunday our flight was in the evening so we wanted to leave our suitcases at the hotel this was the first time a hotel asked us if we wished to leave our luggage during my stay i used the massage room which again i would highly recommend as it s worth the euros on the last day we did make use of the pool and also the sauna which is incredibly relaxing before a flight the hotel itself is beautiful our room had a balcony and looked out on to street which during sunset looks stunning we didn t take advantage of breakfast but we were recommended alsur cafe which i will be returning to as the food is delicious we will definitely be staying here again when we return to barcelona
