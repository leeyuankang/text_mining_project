location was just amazing right on passeig de gracia easy access to metro walking distance from everything the spa pool was ok but needs a bit of updating very good sauna and showering facilities though breakfast was fantastic lovely varied buffet and love the way the rest of europe seems to cook bacon excellent staff were friendly efficient and very helpful also in a city renowned for pickpocketing the hotel had a great sense of security
