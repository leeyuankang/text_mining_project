the service from the staff was fantastic they we re extremely helpful when asked for advice and directions and always happy to help the room was lovely very clean with a lovely balcony overlooking the main street for the price we paid it couldn t have been better i had requested added extras for the room like flowers and champagne what we got was even better than expected the hotel is in an ideal location with everything you need within a minute walk
