my trip was a result of a very bad emotional experience i was overwhelmed upon my arrival at the hotel in tears the staff could not have been more empathetic and caring they offered me water and encouraged me to take my time to check in it was so touching to know strangers can be so kind i appreciated this far beyond the words i can express here thank you
