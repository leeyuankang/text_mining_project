we arrived at this hotel after staying in a not so great hotel and really appreciated the extremely comfy bed and the lovely bathroom it was a minute walk to the top of la rambla and better still a minute walk to the gothic quarter where there are some great restaurants the hotel was easy to landmark and therefore find our way home after a fun night out eating tapas and drinking the local beer and of course sangria the staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful i would definitely recommend this hotel btw if you are going on a cruise starting or ending in barcelona this hotel is a euro taxi ride to the port
