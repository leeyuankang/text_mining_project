the location is fantastic because it s located on the very large and safe street gran via de les corts catalanes plus walking distance from plaza de catalunya start of las ramblas passeig de gracia it s got key metro stations within mins either way plaza de catalunya passeig de gracia urquinaona so you can reach anywhere in barcelona which beats taking the hop on hop off bus as a tourist the room is large with good sized beds and comfy pillows and the balcony is so big that four people could be seated there we had the floor so the view was good lots of freebies in the room like portable tissue packs daily chocolates etc we did not take the breakfast package as we prefer to eat out at a cafe at our town time overall we enjoyed our stay completely and would definitely want to stay here again the front desk staff was also very helpful when i forgot my jacket in the closet upon check out they put me in touch with a courier company to send it to my next hotel i would highly recommend this hotel to others
