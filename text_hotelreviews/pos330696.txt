we booked a night here during a week long holiday in a nearby coastal resort so that we could explore barcelona the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly we ended up being upgraded due to room availability and had a sun terrace with a four poster bed style sun bed on it it was absolutely gorgeous but made us less inclined to want to explore the pool and sun loungers downstairs were lovely and got quite a bit of sun despite being surrounded by tall buildings the shower was really good
