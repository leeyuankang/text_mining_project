room was well decorated clean and beds were very comfortable the hotel is in an ideal location for exploring barcelona with excellent links to public transport and central barcelona great selection of breakfast options plenty to choose from to suit all dietary requirements we stayed at this hotel to celebrate a special birthday and were lucky enough to be allocated an upgraded room would definitely return to this hotel if i was to return to barcelona
