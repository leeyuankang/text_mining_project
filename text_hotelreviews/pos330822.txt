the staff was very welcoming and friendly after our overnight flight from the us we were exhausted when we arrived at the hotel the staff did all they could to get us into our room early as they had a full house the previous night they also upgraded our room to a room with a view our room rate had breakfast included and the dining room was beautiful the breakfast was amazing with many choices of cheese meat rolls hot items and drinks each night at the bar they served tapas and a glass of wine on the house this hotel was centrally located and comes highly recommended from me
