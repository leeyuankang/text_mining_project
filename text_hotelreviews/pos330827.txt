short distance to the plaza catalunya north of it if you re planning on walking to sires this makes the hotel closer to the gaudi houses and church but further from the gothic quarter and la rambla hotel staff are very nice and helpful and breakfast was good with omelette made to order loved the part that they check and make the room twice a day we happily participated in the local siesta there s a deck and a small pool in the back but we never got to it
