the hotel s location is superb the room was smallish but adequate with large bed shower no tub a balcony all the normal amenities were in place and in good quality other types of rooms seemed to be larger breakfast was excellent with very good selection nespresso coffee etc the young lady who attended the breakfast room was very friendly and efficient the pm free wine and food was a very welcome after a long day definitely a bonus point as was the gentlemen whop served the wine overall very good experience
