i went with my boyfriend for my birthday and the hotel couldn t have been nicer the staff were incredibly friendly helpful and nothing was too much to ask the location was perfect half an hours walk to the beach and all the other popular tourist attractions the bus from the airport cost and stopped mins from the hotel the strip of designer and high street shops were also on the same road even though the hotel was on a busy road the room was quite and i had a good night s sleep every night there was also free bottles of water in the rooms mini fridge perfect when foreign water tastes awful compared to our english water haha the decking and pool were always in the sun and in the evenings there is free wine tasting and mini tapas for the guests i couldn t fault the hotel perfection in an even more perfect city strongly recommend if you re willing to spend a tiny bit more the money is worth it
