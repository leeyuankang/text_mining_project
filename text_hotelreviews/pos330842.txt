centrally located nicely decorated with a sweet orchid aroma throughout the hotel lovely linens and comfy bed complimentary wine and tapas in the cozy lobby a special touch and a good way to meet other travelers a wide variety of spread at breakfast the breakfast area was impeccable but the service was mediocre i was there in january but the pool and terrace looked inviting i was sad to leave it felt like home to me i would definitely stay here again
