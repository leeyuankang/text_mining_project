the staff were very professional and attentive and accommodated several requests fast and efficiently we were coming for a family celebration and the five of us were very happy with our booking and would like to return soon location was simply excellent and the superior rooms are fantastic for some extra space and definitely worth considering as you get good value for money we didn t have breakfast at the hotel as there are many places around where you can enjoy local produce at a fraction of the price
