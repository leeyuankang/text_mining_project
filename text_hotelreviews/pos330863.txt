the bed was very comfortable but above all the staff was outstanding pleasant always ready to help could not ask for more the complimentary tea was an added bonus after a long day out visiting it was very nice to sit in a comfortable lounge with a delicious tea and a choice of sandwiches and cakes served by a smiling and helpful waitress a wonderful stay overall
