i was a returning guest my previous stay was in may the hotel is in a great location quiet but close to the center not too big which is an advantage in my opinion the afternoon complimentary tea and snacks was a nice touch used this service once the waitress tending to the guests was very cordial the housekeepers were very cordial as well the floor wasn t clean when i checked in but was cleaned at my request when housekeeping arrived the next day
