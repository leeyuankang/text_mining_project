great location with all of the ameneties and access to downtown barcelona that you could want the metro station is just down the block and la ramblas and plaza catalunya are as well the view from the balcony of the top floor suite was great mt tibidabo sagarada familia and the rest of the city lights at night were impressive the facilites are modern and updated with some minor problems
