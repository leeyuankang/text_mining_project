we loved our stay breakfast was fantastic we both had our choice of eggs made everyday which were always tasty we also enjoyed having afternoon tea by the pool on a few occasions this was a great surprise that we weren t aware of when we booked we arrived a few hours early to check in and didn t expect our room to be ready so it came as a nice surprise that we were able to settle in immediately all staff were very friendly always making time to smile say hello
