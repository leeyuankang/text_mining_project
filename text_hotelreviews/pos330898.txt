this hotel is just perfect perfect location staff are helpful and polite rooms are immaculate but best of all is tea time such a lovely idea free tea coffee fresh juice little sandwiches and bits and bobs served between and just lovely after a busy day to sit down and recoup before getting ready to go out again never experienced this any other hotel and i think more should give it consideration just lovely
