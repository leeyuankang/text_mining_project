very close to town centre at least those parts most tourists visit eg ramblas and also one of the main metro stations i would suggest that using the buses is not to be avoided as is suggested elsewhere some like the bring you directly back from barcelonetta to the hotel just a little research is needed into the routes a ticket for journeys is cheap and easy to use and you see some of the town and not just the wall of a tunnel staff in hotel were all very helpful and pleasant breakfasts were good including some savory dishes so frequently omitted nespreso coffee was used which is also good much better than the older style of hotel coffee which is often poor although still not up to the proper barista style the bathroom was more of an annex to main room but perfectly good whilst the shower was more like a proper wet room plenty of space to move around and a floor which was not slippy when wet comfortable bed and plenty of storage space including a good sized safe big enough to put a professional camera into which for me is important there is a small swimming pool and some sun loungers available for those who like those things
