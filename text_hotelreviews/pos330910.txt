the breakfast choice was sensational i thoroughly recommend you take the breakfast included option especially if you have an early start because very little is open early the gymnasium was ideal for holiday exercise the bar staff and room attendants were excellent proximity to everything was perfect the rooms were quiet and the room climate could be adjusted accurately
