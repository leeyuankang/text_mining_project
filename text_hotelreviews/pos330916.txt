the staff were just brilliant we stayed in the nice suite with the jacuzzi as we were celebrating our engagement and they made us feel like we were staying in the nice suite small touches like making a non alcohol cocktail for my fianc as she is pregnant free of charge one night we came back early and mins later we had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered with a fruit platter i got drunk she was amused they came and got the jacuzzi nice and hot when needed and always very polite and helpful second to none
