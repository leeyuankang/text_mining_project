excellent location close to placa catalunya and passieg de gracia but the street is without much noise elegant decoration comfortable layout of the room sufficient facilities wifi very good professional staff not the warmest style but i like that good varieties of breakfast free late afternoon tapas and drinks i didn t have time to try it but looks good enough and the waitress there is quite tentative in a word the place worth every cent
