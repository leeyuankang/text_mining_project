location perfect for airbus renf plus for walking to all the major visitor attractions of the city even if the admissions were pricey but didn t begrudge that with sagrada de familia free admission to picasso museum first sunday of the month was a pleasant surprise and tour moderniste led by student employed by local tourist office was an excellent introduction for the holiday this walk with others was advertised by hotel so to be recommended and tibidabo not to be missed nor montjuic with trip in cable car down across harbour to beaches thoroughly lovely holiday and hotel provided restful haven even if couldn t use jacuzzi as just not quite warm enough at this time of year
