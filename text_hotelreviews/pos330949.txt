everything this recently renovated hotel is classy clean and very comfortable from the warm welcome at reception after we parked our car in their secure underground car park to the moment we checked out and drove away everything was perfect the staff were professional helpful and friendly at all times the breakfasts were superb with every possible combination of hot cold food and drinks available and were available until am the room we booked was a superior double which was around sq meters in size and very well appointed and quite classy with one of the largest and most comfortable beds we ever slept in there was a well stocked mini bar with complimentary still and sparkling water which was replenished daily there was also tea and coffee making facilities in the room and we had a lovely complimentary bottle of cava in our room on arrival the room overlooked the rear of the hotel and through the rather grand double opening windows we looked down on the superb modern pool and lounge area which was very quiet and peaceful the wifi is free and there is excellent coverage and a strong signal throughout the hotel including the bedroom and all public areas and you don t have to constantly re log on every time you come and go in the hotel it was seamless the location was great too as the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the main square in barca placa de catalunya and just a couple of minutes on from there to la rambla the gothic quarter is around a ten mins walk away and mins will take you to the sagrada familia unfinished cathedral of gaudi a really lovely hotel which we would stay at again in a heartbeat great service great rooms and decor and absolutely great value for money gracias
