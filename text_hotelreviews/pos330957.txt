the hotel was in an excellent spot handy to most things metro stations taxis shops tourist sites etc the staff were all helpful friendly especially the desk staff who helped us with our enquiries on how to get to places both inside and outside the city loved your idea of afternoon teas though the only down side was no tea or coffee with it we d stayed at another catalonia and it was just as nice
