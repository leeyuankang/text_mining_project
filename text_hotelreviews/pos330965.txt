location close to the barrio gotico and the major shopping thoroughfare passeig de gracia but much quieter close to a lot of restaurants both inside and outside of the barrio gotico close to some great restaurants on side streets with a more neighbourhood feel staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and making reservations the best restaurants we visited we would have never found if it had not been for staff recommendations very comfortable room of a good size superior room hotel was extremely clean our room was at the back so it was very quiet we were overlooking the pool area though so it may be noisier in the summer we visited in november great breakfast
