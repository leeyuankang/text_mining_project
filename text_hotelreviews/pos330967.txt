fantastic comfortable stylish hotel great location just far enough away from the crowds of la rambla but close enough to walk to metro station within a minute staff were super helpful friendly and polite nothing too much trouble welcome drink free afternoon tea snacks each day chocolate on our pillow each night we had a ground floor room at the back of the hotel which was really quiet despite the hotel being on a fairly busy main road excellent would highly recommend and would definitely go back again the aerobus arrives and departs from placa catalyna which is no more than a five minute walk away
