we stayed during the week of the bank holiday august in a double room with a terrace the staff were very attentive and really made us feel welcome especially my little one a special mention thanks to the chamber maids who really made an effort to make sure everything was perfect it has a nice swimming pool the location of the hotel was spot on and really handy for the places we wanted to visit it s about a minute walk to the beach and about minutes to the ramblas the metro is literally on the doorstep and the train from and to the airport runs through it there was a small issue with the bed but they offered to move us to another room which i said wasn t necessary as i had unpacked instead the chamber maids found a way to work around the problem they provided an iron and board when asked to loved the free drinks and nibbles in the late afternoon very appreciated the daily supply of free bottled water was brilliant we will definitely stay here again next time we visit barcelona which i hope is soon
