this hotel was just perfect in every way walking distance to all the major areas in the city center for shopping sight seeing eating etc the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful they make you feel special the room is large and beautiful and modern e g the bathroom but retains a very old world feeling the common areas are gorgeous the breakfast was scrumptious and it is in a lovely setting i could not have been more pleased and i am extremely picky about hotels i would stay here every time i come to barcelona without even looking at another hotel
