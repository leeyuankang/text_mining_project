hotel palace gl is probably the best hotel i ve stayed at so far it s located in the upscale eixample neighborhood yet in short walking distance to the old town and la rambla the hotel is very elegantly decorated staff were very diligent and friendly our room was large with a huge bathroom the bed was extremely comfortable the rooftop terrace and restaurant were excellent everything was just perfect we had such a pleasant stay here highly recommended
