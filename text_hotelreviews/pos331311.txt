we stayed nights and checked out on jun the hotel has palace interiors very clean housekeeping does the room makeup as and when you want the concierge is very information and helpful for example they got of tickets for the best flamence show in town the same day which otherwise is usually fully book the black rice with seafood in their menu is a must try the pool is small but more of a relaxation the hotel was very considerate for our children and upgraded our room too for a comfortable stay they have bookings in my name and had reserved rooms it was duplicate booking and we were worried of the cancellation fee but they understood our problem and waived it they could also get us baby sitting for about hour in case we wanted but we were not sure if our kids would really adjust the parking is public right next building and is something like either hour or day flat rate and the concierge can park it for you and get your car when you want
