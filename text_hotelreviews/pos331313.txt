we like the spacious room with its spanish d cor and ambience for every other barcelona accommodation we looked at on the internet the rooms were decorated in modern d cor we prefer a style that reflects the country we are visiting having stayed in barcelona before this time we requested a quiet room away from a busy street and el palace exceeded our need we felt safe walking around the neighborhood late in the evening we splurged on this hotel and it exceeded our expectations highly recommended to others
