the hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous but we were extremely lucky the front desk upgraded us to a junior suite wow it was wonderful and we so appreciated it he saw that we were staying for a while and upgraded us because he had space that s pretty darn fantastic many hotels do not let the front desk make those kinds of decisions it was a great decision and the conceige was always very helpful and everyone welcomed us and acknowledged us when we came and went bravo
