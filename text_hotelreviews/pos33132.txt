solid holiday inn very nice staff good breakfast decent size room for paris well kept clean kids stay for free good insulation of windows although we had a room on floor facing the street it was quiet enough considering this is a central location minute walk to gare de lyon and from there metro and rer will take you anywhere excellent sushi restaurant on the corner next door and a carrefour supermarket minutes away i would stay again and recommend
