the styling of this hotel is right on point it is glamorous and royal as the hotel name probably suggests but at the same shows a modern twist the breakfast room is light airy with high ceilings and beautiful flooring the lobby is grand to say the least the roof top terrace and restaurant where we enjoyed an excellent bloody mary whilst exploring the hotel is painted with murals and the view over barcelona from the highest viewpoint up a further set of stairs is impressive breakfast was superb with a great choice which even included an oriental selection alongside your more traditional options of full english hams cheeses breads croissants etc etc the spa massage was lovely we had a couples massage in the same room and despite telling the lady that i don t fall asleep during massages i was soon waking myself up by snoring the concierge were superb throughout lastly it was my wife s birthday and not only were we supplied with a bottle of cava upon arrival in our room but they also remembered the actual day of her birthday and brought her a cake at breakfast oh and don t miss the jazz club which opens at it was great to pop into after a meal out in barcelona it was busy to say the least
