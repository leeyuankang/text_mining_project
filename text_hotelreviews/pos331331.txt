only bouquets there is nothing to criticise we stayed four nights and apart from the teenagers not being able to use the pool which was undergoing a winter clean we had a wonderful time the checkin service was excellent and we really appreciated the personal information and being shown to our rooms the beds were very comfortable and the sheets were silky soft sorry ritz in madrid you set a very high standard but we think that they have beaten you the room decor was luxurious yet not too fussy the bathrooms were completely refurbished and even though my personal favourite marble finish was missing they were very functional and pleasant l occitane toiletries are always pleasant too we attended the thursday night blues and jazz bar and thorougly enjoyed the band we ate at the restaurant because caelis was fully booked and thoroughly enjoyed that too at our departure we couldn t resist a family photo with the obliging front of house staff a very memorable trip at a wonderful hotel
