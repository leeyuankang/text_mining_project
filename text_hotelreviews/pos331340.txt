all of the staff were welcoming helpful and professional they provided excellent advice directions and recommendations the bartender in the gorgeous roof top patio made us the best mojitos we re every had hotel palace is upmarket formerly the ritz but the staff were not the least but snooty our room was wonderful on the floor a corner room overlooking the main street it was luxurious and beautiful the decor throughout is elegant and tasteful the bathroom was stunning we also found the location very good for our walks through beautiful neighbourhoods and close to many of the main sites of barcelona we took cabs to gruell park and one distant restaurant but other than that all was within walking distance i hope to return to barcelona and i wouldn t stay anywhere else
