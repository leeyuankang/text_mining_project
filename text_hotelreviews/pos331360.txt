all staff were amazing they responded to our email confirming our requests before traveling when we arrived the guest relation personnel meat us and went through all the hotel facilities and escorted us to our beautiful room where we found a lovely card congratulating my husband for his birthday and us for our wedding anniversary a bottle of champagne and a delicious chocolate cake the location of the hotel is at an excellent location very accessible to all attractions and within walking distance in the classy quiet suburb l eixample the decor is grand we felt we are staying in a palace we loved the roof top garden we highly recommend it
