what a classy hotel the staff was attentive and service minded i enjoyed coming back to a clean and made up room in the evening with my bed opened for the night a chocolate on my pillow fresh water on the mantel and my slippers next to my bed on a small rug old world charm and service with modern amenities such as a tv hidden in the mirror above the fireplace dimmable spotlights and a nice rain shower and modern fixtures in the bathroom the bedroom was large and roomy for european standards the large room behind the lobby is great for meeting up with friends for a drink if it s too hot on the roof top terrace
