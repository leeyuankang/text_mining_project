the staff were all so friendly and very helpful where ever we were in the hotel the service at concierge was above our expectations the door men were so nice and the staff including the room girls were really nice and very discreet we loved to be able to have a swim in the rooftop pool which made this hotel very special we travelled with our family from australia and of us had a great time
