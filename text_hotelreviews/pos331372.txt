good bad pillow was little tough for my wife but overall room was good negative think is the pictures on the website it gives you a wrong impression as the hotel it self does not have that luxury feel location is superb and a specially if you young and willing to hang out all night remind me of some area in new york with a madrid sharm no wonder why all hotel was full with the british guest also if you have time to spend at the hotel they have almost full buffet at bar from till pm which is very nice addition staff is nice and friendly
