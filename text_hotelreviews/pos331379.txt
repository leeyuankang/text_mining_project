we loved the old world elegance of the decor the staff couldn t have been more gracious and helpful everyone was warm and friendly the location and size of our room was perfect the rooftop breakfast terrace and our wonderful server valeria created a great start to the day everything we wanted to see was in easy walking distance including the exquisite opera house where we saw two performances as well as the starting point for the tours we took of the sagrada familia and the picasso walking tour and museum both of which we highly recommend
