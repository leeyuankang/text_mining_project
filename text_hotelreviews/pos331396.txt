an outstanding hotel in every way one of the best i have ever stayed in the decor is delightful the location central the rooms extremely comfortable the service excellent and the kitchen is outstanding we took a junior suite overlooking the courtyard no view but very very quiet in the middle of a busy city it is expensive but excellent value for a special break in barcelona
