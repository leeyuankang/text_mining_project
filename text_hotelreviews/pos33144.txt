i thoroughly enjoyed my one night stay at the holiday inn the staff were very warm friendly and helpful as i arrived on an early morning flight the staff were helpful with luggage storage and providing an earlier check in the room was bright spacious i chose this hotel due to it s proximity to the gare de lyon and my onward travels it was even closer to the station than i had expected which made it very easy to catch the tgv the next day
