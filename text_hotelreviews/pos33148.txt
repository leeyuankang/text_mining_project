wonderful staff very courteous and attentive we missed breakfast on the first morning and the staff brought us coffee croissants in the lounge hotel only min walk from gare de lyon which is only a min train journey from gare de nord very handy when travelling by eurostar to paris although located in a busy area the hotel is very quiet and no street noise hence we slept late on the first morning our room was at the rear of the hotel on floor hotel lift was really fast too our room had recently been renovated to a very high standard and was beautiful huge bed with luxurious pristine bed linen new bathroom with fabulous new modern shower although renovated they have kept many original architectural features of the hotel and enhanced its overall appearance and it is a stunning mix of old new we highly recommend a nearby restaurant called a la biche au bois a small friendly welcoming restaurant with a wonderful vibe food is fresh home cooked coq au vin is a house specialty frequented mainly by parisiens so you know it s good we would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others i don t usually do reviews so this is an honest review of a hotel which delivered more than we expected
