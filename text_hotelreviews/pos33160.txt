the style art deco of the room is gorgious buffet breakfast is quite correct croissants are excellent fruits juices are fresh staff is very friendly at the reception desk and at the bar for once affordable very close by walk to gare de lyon so leaving the luggage at early arrival and late departure is most conveniant
