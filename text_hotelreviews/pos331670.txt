have stayed in a few properties over the years in barcelona but this is by far the best yet we received a fantastic welcome at the property and had a very welcome glass of cava whilst we were being checked in our room was spacious modern and the beds were of the most comfortable i have slept in we had a lovely city view too also loved that there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room and a packet of crisps and a biscuit would highly recommend this property for a stay in barcelona
