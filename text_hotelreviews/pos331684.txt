we got straight off the aircraft walked to the taxi stand and and got straight into a taxi for the hotel the price for the taxt transfer was listed in a prominent position and at the time of this review the fare was just under euro one way the hotel was in an excellent location the interior was spotless and the the staff extremely polite and helpful the room was of a decent size and again was very clean the bed was also very comfortable we didn t book the breakfast with the room it was listed on the booking com website as being euro per person and a subsequent e mail from booking com offered it at euro s which we though was somewhat expensive and opportunistic upon asking at the hotel we found the breakfast was only euro per person which is quite different the breakfast turned out to be of a very good standard with a good choice both continental style and eggs bacon etc
