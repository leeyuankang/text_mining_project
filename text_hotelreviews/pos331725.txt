the location is great it is near passeig de gracia train station which makes it easy to get to from airport la rambla is a nice wallking distance away placa de catalunya is also easy walking distance and from there you can get city bus tour rides the rooms are nice and clean the shower and bathroom is big you have access to a nice sun lounge area and pool the staff are very friendly and welcoming i will definitely stay there again when visiting barcelona
