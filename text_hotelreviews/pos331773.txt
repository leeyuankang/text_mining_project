the hotel is on one of the main roads through the centre of barcelona but we were not bothered by traffic noise despite being at the front of the building thanks either to good insulation or being on the floor the metro is a few minutes walk away and the hotel is within reasonable walking distance of many tourist sights and plenty of restaurants
