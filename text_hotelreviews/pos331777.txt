we had a superior terrace room room and it was incredible having our own terrace was the best part we had sun loungers and a table and chairs to sit in the sun and enjoy the incredible views could even see the tops of the sagrada try and get a room on the floor with the view the sound proofing was excellent no noise at all from the street due to the double exterior door the room was cleaned to excellent standard every day and the bathroom items topped up daily the staff were friendly and helpful the buffet breakfast was really good it wasn t included in our room price but was only euro min walk to catalonia square because you re a distance from all the action you re near the local restaurants that aren t heavily tourist priced so you can enjoy great food without paying a big bill
