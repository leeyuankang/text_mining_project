boutique and slightly quirky hotel yoga bag in our room friendly and very helpful staff breakfast was great with a good variety of fresh foods on the buffet and lovely local dishes to order alongside barista coffee easy walking into the centre of the city and metro stops etc would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others a perfect city getaway
