we really liked the style and the design that has been carefully composed down to the last details from the original floor tiles to the locally designed textiles the staff was nice and helpful the breakfast was lovely with a great selection of various delicacies in the superstylish bar cafe lounge area libertine we also tried some tapas at the bar which was similarly amazing would recommend the place to design conscious young couples who like to chill out in a relaxed stylish environment
