i loved the concept and care that was obviously put in this hotel the building is beautiful as is the character pure delightful mediterranean design of the rooms the beds were very comfortable as were the rain showers and i appreciated the well stocked minibar and tray of local sweets i loved the options to eat great food work and relax in either the coffee bar the bohemian lounge bar or restaurant all staff was helpful professional and enthusiast location was very convenient too for a walk downtown to from the aerobus local buses or underground and restaurants nearby lovely would definitely come here again not your average star hotel
