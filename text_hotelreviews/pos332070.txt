the staff were helpful and friendly from the start the hotel was nicely located only a short walk to areas of interest it was nicely decorated and very comfortable a mixture of new and old features a cool selection of tempting treats from the mini bar the bus tours are a good way to see the city we crammed as much in as possible but still feel we would have plenty more to explore if we went back where we would be happy to stay at casa bonay again
