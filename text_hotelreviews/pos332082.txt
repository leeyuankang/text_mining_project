i absolutely loved my room it felt like a private retreat i had one of the rooms with a private terrace looking into the courtyards of the surrounding buildings i felt immersed in a barcelona neighborhood the terrace and sitting room were a perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing and re energize for a night of tapas tasting a bar hopping loved everything about my room including the yoga kit i felt completely comfortable staying there alone the hotel staff are really nice also they have live music and djs in the bar at night so be sure to plan to spend one night at the hotel
