this hotel ticked every box for me it s located within walking distance from transport restaurants and shopping the staff particularly in reception were professional friendly and more than happy to offer their local knowledge to assist guests during their stay the building has been restored with a balance of old and modern fittings the room design and attention to detail is what makes this hotel stand out from the rest
