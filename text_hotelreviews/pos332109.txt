we spent the better part of our honeymoon in barcelona at casa bonay and loved staying there it s well located near the metro the bed was the most comfortable bed we stayed in in europe and the overall design hip we loved the shower and visiting the roof top terrace along with the bar and coffee shop both located on the campus of the hotel the mini bar snacks were also really great and not too badly priced so we tried a few when we didn t feel like running to the mercat when we checked out we found out that it was only months old and were so surprised everything went so smoothly that we thought it had been around longer
