visited for a four night stay the staff were so friendly genuine and passionate about the hotel the bed was very comfortable and the shower brilliant our balcony room was comfortably sized with an interesting take on clothes storage which really worked the balcony was lovely for coffee in the morning the bar is elegant with friendly bar staff who really know how to make a cocktail there was a lovely informal terrace bar on the roof which was a great place for a night cap we will definitely be returning
