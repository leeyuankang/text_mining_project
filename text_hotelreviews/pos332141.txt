this place screams hipster heaven the cafe serves great coffee not your typical spanish coffee served almost everywhere else the rooms are pretty minimal much like a hipster cafe the staff are great too they speak really good english and are pretty helpful as this was our time back in barcelona we didn t mind staying further away from the hustle and bustle of either la rambla placa catalunya or passeig de gracia
