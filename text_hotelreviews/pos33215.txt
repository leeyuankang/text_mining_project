just a minute walk to gare de lyon station so it s a very good base from which to explore paris it s a really quiet neighborhood lots of restaurants with good affordable food and a convenience store nearby plus very friendly staff that accommodated all our simple requests as an extra treat we were given a room with a balcony overlooking the main street and train station great waking up with that view it was a very enjoyable stay
