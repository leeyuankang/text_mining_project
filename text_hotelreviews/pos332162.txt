staff were really friendly and helpful the room was clean and comfortable and i really liked the interior design we stayed in a small double room with terrace which looked out the back of the hotel but it was nice and quiet and got lots of sun until late afternoon the safe worked and the fire alarm behaved itself the location was great you re within walking distance to la segrada familiar and passeig de gracia we hardly had to use the metro
