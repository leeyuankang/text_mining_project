the location is excellant for all site seeing and for buses and the train station the staff could not do more for you and the hotel is worth everyone one of its stars it s great to see so many of the old features have been left and incorporated into the new the bed was so comfortable it was a joy to fall into after a hard days shopping and sightseein i loved the size of the shower and having different shower heads was something that you don t find everywhere we stayed in room the whole concept of having a fantastic restaurant real coffee shop a real teashop and a really relaxing bar all working together in one location is brilliant elephant crocodile monkey is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a meal that is tasty completely different well cooked and beautifully presented the staff are so well informed about all the dishes and the fact that they use as many local produce and suppliers as possible is a big plus on my part satans coffee is coffee as it should be full of flavor and lots of choice the homemade cakes etc are worth forgetting the diet it is worth paying the extra and having the breakfast the choice that you get is very good and completely different you can have hot or cold with good choice of each what more can i say book it and see for yourself
