what is special about casa bonay it is the special feeling you get from the first step you put in you feel like in an other epoch it is more than a great hotel because it allows you to feel home at the same time the building itself is beautiful and recently renewed rooms are clean comfortable with a minimal design decor and beautiful tiles floor i loved the bath necessaries with a very special graphic image if i have to find something to say it is about the roll curtains not always easy to manage and a missing chair especially if you spend more days in the room all the related place to eat drinks are great for the design colors atmosphere music totally in love with the lobby where you can have a good drinks or glass of wine enjoying evening or afternoon love the printed shirts corner near the reception the whole concept of casa bonay it is simply great not last all the staff is young efficient always ready to help i would definitely recommend this place
