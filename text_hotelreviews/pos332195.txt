the hotel is in a good spot the metro is just minutes away the lobby is quite stylish breakfast was interesting you could choose between options one of which was bread with goate cheese salmon red whine seriously and some onion jam i must say i tried it but didn t like it even though they were so friendly and made us a plate with things we could eat so lovely our room was small and the window looked in a corridor so it was really dark but everything was very clean und comfy
