i stayed as a solo female traveller and i found the hotel really matched my needs there are excellent restarants sharing the same building space which meant that i did not have to worry about walking back to the hotel alone late at night staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel has lots of style and personality definitely for guests who do not want to stay in a faceless hotel shower superb and bed very comfortable
