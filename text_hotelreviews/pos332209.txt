loved our weekend getaway in this superbly designed boutique hotel the staff was super friendly and warm and shared excellent recommendations for restaurants super insights on where locals go the highlight of our stay was the breakfast excellent a la carte choice of delightful local and international dishes and some much appreciated healthy options besides beautiful buttery croissants very sweet personal touch with candles for a birthday breakfast
