we loved our stay in casa bonay from the first minute all the staff we met were exceptionally friendly our room was beautiful with a view over barcelona roofs and the sun shining onto our bed in the morning the hotel bar is incredibly classy with an amazing choice of beers and very comfortable sofas they even have their own brand of soap and shampoos which smell delicious the hair dryer was very powerful it is only a couple of meters from the metro and in walking distance from the beach the centre and the gaudi house i would come back anytime
