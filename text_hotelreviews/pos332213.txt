we loved this hotel a brand new conversion of a century building it combines beautiful old features such as tiled floors and high ceilings with the very best in modern design the rooms are simple and uncluttered which combined with a restful colour scheme of dark blue and ecru and the serenity of a central tiled courtyard creates an oasis of calm in the centre of barcelona we particularly enjoyed relaxing in the comfortable little seating area in our room lounging on our patio and observing the hipsters of barcelona in the cocktail bar the young staff are very friendly and helpful even contacting us to say we had left a hairbrush behind in our room highly recommended we hope to return
