we were given a room that was like a cell painted out windows we had requested a room not over the road away from traffic but this was awful plus reception had asked bath or shower abruptly we said shower but it was not what we got went back to reception and we were given another room higher floor facing rear of hotel with a window this was after all the hottest day of the year it must be noted that the beds were foldaway beds not proper divans i work in the travel industry hotels and know a foldaway when i see one our time table did not allow us to go back and take on reception again and we stuck with it as it was a short stay not really the type of service i have previously received at the cumberland
