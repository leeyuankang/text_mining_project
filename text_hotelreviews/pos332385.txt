i booked this last minute due to commuters chaos and train failure at paddington i thought what could happen in a luxurious four star hotel i checked in at hoping i ll finally get a good nights sleep i had stayed with my parents at cumberland as a child even before the refurbishment i always felt safe and happy there however i had a sleepless night due to my hectic day and delays only to doze off shortly after am then we were woken up by the fire alarm and had to evacuate at half awake dressed on the way down there was not slippers nor a cotton gown in my room the air quality was bad all residents stayed out for no less than minutes i understand accidents happen but no explanation was given i checked out at because i couldn t stand staying on the premises i paid for three hours of broken sleep and no breakfast not even the courtesy of an explanation of what the fire was about
