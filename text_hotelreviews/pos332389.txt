location at marble arch is on oxford st buses to anywhere and underground walk to so many of the attractions is only minutes or so lots of eateries and shops nearby staff were courteous and helpful restaurant and upstairs bar were excellent and well managed not the cheapest hotel but it was so well run it was worth it
