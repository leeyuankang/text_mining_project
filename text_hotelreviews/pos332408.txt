the hotel is a nice hotel but the room could benefit from a deep clean especially around the sink and shower however when i went to use the executive lounge the fridges for the drinks were broken so no cold drinks the air conditioning was poor so on a hot day the room was not enjoyable a shame as that facility can make a difference
