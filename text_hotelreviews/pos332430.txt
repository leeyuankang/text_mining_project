the location was fabulous there was a mix up with my info as i booked through booking com and the hotel had not received the update si it took over minutes to check in after a hour day coming from the u s the staff took forever to sort it out and finally i asked to see a manager and she took care of the problem my room was lovely big crowds in the lobby and a bit noisy for my liking but all things considered i would stay there again
