the breakfast was very good a large choice of food and drinks the location is perfect close to tube and shopping street the room we got was nice exept the view the beds were compfy and the roomsize was perfect concierges all very friendly guys who make you feel welcome one lady at the reception was very nice too we had to ask for a different room its just terrible that you have to go and ask for a better room and that they first try to put you in non quality room you should get immediatly for what you paid for
