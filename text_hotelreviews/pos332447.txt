when ever i visit the capital i always stay at the cumberland on this occasion i was travelling with my granddaughter and when i mentioned it had been my birthday a couple of days previous to our arrival staff kindly updated us to an executive suite free canap s in the evening and breakfast in the morning a lovely gesture i would recommend this hotel for it s location and friendly polite service
