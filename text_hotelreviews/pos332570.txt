stayed here as a birthday treat for my daughter i had notified the staff of that earlier got a free upgrade to an executive room that was partially overlooking oxford street and my daughter also got a small birthday surprise in the room when i got back i always choose the cumberland for trips to london due to the great location of the hotel it has recently been refurbished and the lobby is far more spacious now overall the cumberland never disappoints the staff are very competent and helpful
