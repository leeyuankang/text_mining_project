excellent stay again so convenient for my wife to do a little shopping in oxford street whilst i attended business meetings on departure we left a kindle in the room we emailed the hotel from the train and they advised us within minutes that they had found it it arrived at our home the next day by post excellent service we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if i had a gripe it would be that some of the rooms are on the small side but adequate by london standards
