my family and i booked one twin room and one double room the twin room was spacious and very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable which were lovely to look forward to after a long day of shopping i especially liked the small extras that made quite the difference to make our stay enjoyable we had extra pillows and extra towels at hand and all the other standard amenities like a hair drier and an iron i enjoyed using the hotel s complementary hi speed wifi that was available through out the hotel the hotel has a great atmosphere and is located in a prime location in london just a stone s throw away from the major landmarks like hyde park and marble arch as well as the many other major landmarks of london breakfast at the market restaurant was slightly over priced but their excellent options compensate for this there are quite a lot of food options that would suit all tastes the staff and porters are very welcoming and helpful they were prompt overall a very welcoming hotel
