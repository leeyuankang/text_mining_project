the hotel is located in a very quiet and elegant area of vienna close to the metro train stations and at walking distance from sch nbrunn castle park min there are also very nice restaurants nearby without having to go up to the city center we were impressed of the cleaning service each evening when we returned at the hotel the room looked as new and the towels were changed breakfast was good we really enjoyed our stay here
