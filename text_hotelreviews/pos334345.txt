there was a garage where we could put our bicycles while there was only one person at the reception he handled everything as well as possible he even gave me a free glass of champagne because he noticed it was my birthday he called the restaurant where we had a reservation to let them know we were late and he called us a taxi the place was clean spacious and well appointed it has an old world charm with modern amenities we thought this was an exceptional value and would happily stay there again
