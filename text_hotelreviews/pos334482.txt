the hotel staff was wonderful they made themselves like family anything we needed their answer was always yes especially nadia maria damian and many others were so helpful the rooms were clean and up to date the beds very comfortable and sheets always felt clean there were plenty of towels and the other toilet items like shampoo soap conditioners also two great restaurants in the hotel and a great variety of pubs and restaurants within walking distance i ve stayed in london hotels in the past and the london grosvenor square marriott was by far was my best hotel experience ever i would recommend this place to anyone
