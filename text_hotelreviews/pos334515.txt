great room with a welcoming bottle of water as well as tea and coffee making facilities it s also nice to be able to open a window rather than rely on the aircon very comfy bed and pillows and the android type portable hand set would be useful for any non tech savy travellers good selection of toiletries sumptuous bath robe and nice hot shower if a little lacking in power on check out we did tell the hotel the bath outlet seemed partially blocked because the water drained away very slowly and if showering your feet were submerged well appointed exec lounge although limited to just a few scones and cakes at tea time coffee was excellent as was maria who looked after us very well literally only about yards from selfridges and a nice view onto grosvenor square from the breakfast room
