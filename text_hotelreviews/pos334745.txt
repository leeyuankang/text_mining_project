the staff members were super helpful and friendly the breakfast buffet had a lot of varieties the hotel lies within a very dynamic neighborhood restaurants shops cafe s and supermarkets are just within a minute walking distance from the hotel the hotel is about mins away from an underground station making commuting within the city using public transport very suitable
