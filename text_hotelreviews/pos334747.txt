we did get real good price from booking com the room was big clean and tidy as per my request i ve got double bed instead of twin bed was big and comfortable wifi was free and very fast very close to hotel you can find several options of public transport so getting to city center and back is so easy it take just few stops of tram day tickets for public transport can be purchased at reception which is really convenient
