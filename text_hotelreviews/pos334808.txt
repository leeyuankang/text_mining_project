the biggest advantages of this hotel is reasonable price and location the latter is maybe not in the nicest area but it s very close to the s bahn and tram station min walk to matzleinsdorfer platz station the room was very clean and comfortable all facilities were provided as per the list mentioned on the website nothing to complain about great thing was that we could leave our baggage for free after check out and pick it up later
