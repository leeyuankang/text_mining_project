our very short but happy stay in the hotel began with the pleasant reception staff our room was quiet very spacious and well equipped with a bar fridge and safe and all the necessary amenities the linen and towels were fresh and crisp and the bed was extremely comfortable there was a gym and a bar and although we didn t have breakfast the buffet looked delicious there was a supermarket next door which could be useful the hotel is a pleasant minute walk from the old town centre but you can also easily catch the team we certainly recommend this hotel
