customer service the lady at the front desk paula if i remember correct was indeed took any opportunity to assist always was ready for an extra mile breakfast was good though not great coffee tea in lobby is great touch room was rather small but was comfortable and had all i needed and super clean the definite plus in this hotel is the warmth of the team who make you indeed welcome i likely return to this place if i visit barcelona again
