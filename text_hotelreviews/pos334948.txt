we travel extensively and we have been fortunate to stay in hotels all over the world and have even been spoilt by butler service on occasions however never before have i experienced such a genuinely warm welcome by a hotel paula was our main point of contact and her kindness and attention to detail knew no limits it is true that this is a fun clean funky hotel and feels that little bit out of the ordinary it is true that the location is superb right next to metro station and close to facilities restuarants etc but it is true also to say that the warm and sincere welcome makes it even more special
