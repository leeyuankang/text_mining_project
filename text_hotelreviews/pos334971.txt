previous to staying at the hotel i asked how to best get there and got an immediate very nice and detailed response the hotel is more like a boutique hotel arriving there feels like staying with friends its wonderful very nice and smart design clean and friendly and educated staff check in was fast and easy very helpful with restaurant recommendations etc room very nice with complimentary water and apples good sorted mini fridge sufficient amenities and the possibility to regulate room temperature it was very cold those days so extra heating was appreciated the breakfast which we took one day was very nice and prepared with a lot of care they have a lobby with self service tea and coffee which is very generous
