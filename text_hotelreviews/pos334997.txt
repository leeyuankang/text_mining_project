excellent location so close to pl molina station and walkable distance to fontana station lots of caf s and grocery stores nearby safe neighborhood and out of the touristy areas but still very easy to reach to the touristy ones took me mins to walk at a moderate pace from the hotel to av diagonal along gran de gracia street if you keep walking you eventually get to the strip where all the high end designer brands are staff was friendly and helpful
