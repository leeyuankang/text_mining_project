there is nothing negative to say about this hotel and the staff were extremely friendly whilst the location is about mins walk from the city centre it is next to the metro and the walk through the lively street is enjoyable the room was extremely clean and the bed very comfortable and the fact there was free tea and coffee available at any time was a bonus
