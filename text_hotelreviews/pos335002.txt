pol and grace is an adorable hotel in reality it looks even better than what it is shown in the photos all the people that work there are caring calm and helpful i loved the aroma the place had it made me feel very peaceful and relaxed the room was very comfortable clean and decorated with taste as the other guests have mentioned there is delicious coffee tea and water in the lobby available all the time for free as coffee lovers this detail made us very happy the food that was offered for breakfast was fresh and tasty the only thing that i would suggest to the staff is to try and keep the scrambled eggs and sausages warm during the whole breakfast period the area is very quiet and beautiful there are metro and bus stations near by we preferred walking and it was very easy to get around getting from the hotel to the famous park guell took us minutes by foot if we ever have the chance to be in barcelona again we would look for no other place
