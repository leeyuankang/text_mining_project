this is a fab hotel great location right next to molina metro modern and clean room with a big bathroom for a city hotel the staff at this hotel could not be nicer and it is very clear that customer service and satisfaction is high on their list of priorities we really enjoyed the breakfast each morning and we felt there was plenty of choice the tea and coffee in the reception area is a nice touch and there are lovely wine glasses if you are like us and like a bottle of wine in our room in the evenings fridge in the room also helped with this a great stay cannot thank pol and grace enough
