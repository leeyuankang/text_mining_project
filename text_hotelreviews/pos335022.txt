the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful i loved the location the area seemed calmer and less touristy then other parts of the city yet there was still alot of great cafe s restaurants and shopping near by super close to the metro and easy to reach all sight seeing areas by metro or by foot the hotel had a nice relaxing feel to it i felt comfortable hanging out in the lobby and enjoying the complimentary tea coffee loved the unique boutique feel of the place
