this hotel is the good surprise of our trip in spain i was initially reluctant to choose this hotel that looks a little too trendy for me but at the end i am very satisfied of this choice this hotel sucessfully combines the comfort of a star hotel with the relaxed atmosphere of an hostel i especially liked the smiling personnel that speaks perfectly english the huge and very comfortable bed the high pressure water delivered by the shower the do it yourself corner with free coffee the attention given by the hotel to each small details that make you feel at home
