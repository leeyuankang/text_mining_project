location is great right on the edge of the gracia area which is a real local suburb of barcelona loads of great bars and restaurants on your doorstep metro station literally seconds from the front door super super friendly staff probably the most outstanding feature of this hotel modern rooms relatively simple does the trick perfectly for a weekend
