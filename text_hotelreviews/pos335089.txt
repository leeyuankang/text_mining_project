just the fact it was a different feel to a hotel much more independent and different loved the relaxed feel of the lobby and reception with it s free coffee tea and cocktail making diy area great relaxed seating there too the room was so relaxing and the bed one of the most comfortable we ve ever slept in in a hotel everywhere was very clean and the staff very friendly
