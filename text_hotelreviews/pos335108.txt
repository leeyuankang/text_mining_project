pol grace is located within a minute walk to the city centre the staff are extremely helpful and even offered to hold our luggage and allowed us to park our car in the secure parking area when we arrived before the check in time although a little way out of the centre the walk is easy with lots of interesting things to see along the way breakfast each morning was very good with lots of choice from cooked eggs to fruit and yoghurts
