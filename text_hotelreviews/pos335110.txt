staff was so helpful and gracious i mentioned that i was celebrating my engagement and when we arrived they had decorated the room with balloons and love quotes very memorable the hotel is a comfortable place with lots of areas to sit and visit outside of the room perfect neighborhood for easy access to metro and great restaurants within one block
