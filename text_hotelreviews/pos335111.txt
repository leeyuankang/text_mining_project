i liked the smell in the lobby i still remember it very very clean hotel very organised modern comfortable and in quiet place not far from the pla a catalunya the staff is very friendly and young energetic youths they are very helpful too this hotel gave the trip feeling like home highly recommended for economic young and solo travellers not the type of hotels for families with noisy children
