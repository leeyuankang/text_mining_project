the location was good and the staff was always friendly and helpful the room was nice and the bed was comfortable but a little tight with the couch and king bed so not much room for luggage the breakfast never looked great so we always ate elsewhere the free mini bar was a coke can a water bottle and some orange juice the snacks consisted of a candy bar and some chips
