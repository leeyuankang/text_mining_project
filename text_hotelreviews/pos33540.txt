very nice hotel everything excellent but the size of the room that is small anyway its usual in paris free coffee hot chocolate machine on lobby free welcome water in the mini bar awesome staff renewed not long ago so everything is perfect good value for the money well located close to jardins du luxembourg and some nice small shops
