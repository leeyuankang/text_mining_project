the hotel is great we had a big room with comfy beds and good facilities everything worked perfectly it is a great advantage that the hotel has its own private parking with lots of places right in front and with no extra payment the staff was great they helped us with a map of the city which was of great use the train station is minutes away but there is no ticket point there the u bahn station is minutes away and the public transportation works excellent the u bahns come from to minutes
