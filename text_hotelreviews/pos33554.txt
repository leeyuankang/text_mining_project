we stayed for my partners and the staff here made our stay always sooo helpful and friendly i dropped my ring down the sink and they made every effort to get it and they did so i am very thankful to you for that excellent location near the metro and the rer plenty around such as bars and places to eat and a supermarket we will definitely be returning to this hotel
