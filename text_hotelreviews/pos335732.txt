i booked this place because we wanted to be able to walk to the spanish riding academy and museums there is no place closer to the famous lipizzan stallions than this one i was pleasantly surprised that we were one small block away from the stables so we could easily see the lipizzaners walking across the street and go on a stable tour if you want to see a performance plan several months to a year in advance we enjoyed seeing the horse drawn carriages driving by the property very often everything is clean shops are easy to get to from gucci and swarovski crystal to little family shops and tourist shops museums are an easy walk its a good idea to start your visit to the city by going on a horse carriage ride the drivers give an excellent overview and it s at a walking pace so you can see the hotel staff was very nice and helpful with getting a car to the airport the breakfast was fantastic and the dining room was lovely the only downside was that we went during a heat wave and the only cooling in the ancient historic building rooms is from a fan so you have to just accept that if you want to be in the heart of old vienna
