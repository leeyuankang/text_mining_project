the location was ideal right in the heart of the city beside most of the sights visitor attractions we wanted to see the continental breakfast suited us with the bonus of making our own waffles and maple syrup the staff were pleasant and helpful all our requests prior to arrival were met including a room away from the lift free wifi and access to pc and printer were much appreciated
