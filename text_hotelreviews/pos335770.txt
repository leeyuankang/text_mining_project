this was our time at the pertschy but i have stayed in other vienna hotels too in the past the pertschy is not posh has not the nicest toiletries and the wifi although free works depending on where in the building you are however the pertschy is vienna itself and simply lovely in its quirky old viennese style building with its courtyard also the beds are incredibly comfy with proper very light down duvets as should be in winter the location is amazing and simply could not be better
