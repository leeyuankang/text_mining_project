you can see that it a former quite gracious hotel perfectly located in a quiet street close to the centre of vienna nearby are all the facilities you could possibly wish for a visit to julius meinl is a must the daily perfomances in st peters church in the same street are not to be missed it is undergoing renovation i hope to restore it to its former glory our room was spacious and comfortable very reasonable value for money we had room overlooking a street with several cafes horse drawn carriages pass the front door of the hotel every few minutes giving it a charming effect
