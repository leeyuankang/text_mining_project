the location was perfect whenever i book a hotel i always consider location first and foremost pertschy palace hotel turned out to be a great choice as it is centrally located it is in the inner ring of vienna so all the sights are accessible by foot or by tram or by hop on off bus which we did the hotel is around minutes to the opera where you can find the hop on off bus station the hotel itself is nice with its own viennese charm our room was spacious and comfortable and clean the breakfast buffet was great with a wide selection of bread and pastries cheese and cold cuts yoghurt fresh fruits and some hot entrees like scrambled egg bacon and sausage overall very satisfied
