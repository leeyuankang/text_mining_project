great that there s a coffee machine in the reception area available for guests to use at all times so could get a tea and coffee to have in room before going for breakfast brilliant location so close by to many city sights we stay at easter time so had local easter markets and most shop windows had easter decorations there were multicoloured hard boiled eggs to buy everywhere
