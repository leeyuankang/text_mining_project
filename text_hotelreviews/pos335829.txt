great location in the heart of vienna two minute walk away from the u bahn and major tourist sites great selection of food for breakfast our room was very clean cleaned everyday while we were at breakfast the cleaners even folded my pjs and left them on my pillow every morning would highly recommend this hotel we stayed for nights and will definitely be staying again
