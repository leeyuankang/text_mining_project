awesome location in the sideway from the graben street less than minutes to the stephansplatz metro station and the stephansdom itself the room was really nice and comfortable for a short stay but actually it could serve for a longer one too very modern bathroom and a welcome drink and sweets were a nice thing to find in the room the staff at the reception was extremely helpful also there s a computer to use in the lobby and a coffee machine and the breakfast was great too
