the staff were lovely location is amazing take a walk through le jardin du luxembourg it s so beautiful and just down the road from the hotel the rooms are clean and modern it s worth upgrading to a queen or even better a king size room because they are a little more spacious the hotel also offers a complimentary mini bar which is always bonus
