location very close to metro station vavin and a min walk to montparnasse which was great for us to get to the airport and other places out of paris by train a lot of food options around with our favourite being the creole restaurant just next door convenient location yet off a quiet street so we could get a good rest we booked the queen club room and were not disappointed by the good size as compared to other smaller places we have stayed in paris before the bathroom is well sized with good hot shower and bathtub good finishes and nice decor in the room and quite comfortable bed nice touch of a mini fridge in the room well stocked with a good selection of drinks and the main lobby has a coffee machine or tea making facilities if the guest desires am impressed by the hotel having stayed at other places and this is definitely good for value staff is also helpful with our requests such as helping to print tickets for us or prepared to get supplies for us if we have any issues
