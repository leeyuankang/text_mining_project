i could check in a couple of hours earlier after an exhausting flight so what did i get a large sunny room and a jacuzzi in the middle of it you take a bath you have a nap you enjoy the city from the terrace on the roof and then go for a walk across vienna which is magnificent special thanks to luca guy at the reception the next day i had breakfast which was quite alright although coffee is not just fine as in italy you get fresh milk fruit cocktail that i ve never met before highly recommended
