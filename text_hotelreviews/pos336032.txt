in no particular order factors that make the alma boutique hotel a good choice for a vienna stay location is great really accessibility to places of interest i e can walk to opera house passing through shopping high street and some attractions buy tickets for sightseeing bus at hotel reception and there s a stop close to the hotel to hop on or walk to the marriott for another stop on the red line boat cruise start point is also close by easy access to places to eat would seem expensive esp for late bookings like mine however value for money with breakfast included is derived from the location factor among other things e g eliminate most commute costs excellent wifi good breakfast staff are welcoming and helpful alexandra and the gentlemen suggesting things to do sightseeing providing directions to places etc welcome gift pack very nice personal touch room single not too big but just right for me solo traveler comfy bed with accessible charging points for my devices liked the bedside light
