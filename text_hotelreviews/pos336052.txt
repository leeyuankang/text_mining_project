the hotel is at great location to the vic and the old town so that after working you could still have some time for shopping and sightseeing the staff were friendly and respond to requests effectively and positively the breakfast is also good and you could get hot water and free coffee and tea until pm the only complain is that the bed is kind of narrow would stay here again if next un meeting calls me to vienna
