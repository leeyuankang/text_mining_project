wonderful boutique hotel in an excellent location we couldn t have picked a better spot if we tried this hotel is in the district and was only a walk from the metro station the hotel it self is lovely very clean and welcoming pretty much everything a boutique hotel should be the internet was super fast which is not always the case here in europe when traveling to get to the main city centre on foot was about a depending on your speed
