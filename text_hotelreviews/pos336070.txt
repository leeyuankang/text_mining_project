the location was excellent although it was close to the metro and a busy street the hotel itself was in a quiet pedestrian only alley st stephen s cathedral was about three minutes walk away the staff were very friendly and helpful recommending a restaurant and then phoning ahead to ensure i got a seat as it was a saturday night the hotel was well designed the decor was lovely and it was extremely clean the breakfast was delicious
