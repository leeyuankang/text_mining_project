good location in the inner stadt very close to airport bus drop off in morinplatz and the u bahn station only a few minutes to each close to restaurants tourist sites and supermarket comfortable rooms although bright red bathroom decor too some time to get used to nice roof top terrace which would be lovely in spring and summer nice welcoming staff appreciated the morning gruss gott and the maps and other tourist info provided at check in
