when we first arrived at this hotel i didn t know what to make of it but the longer we were there the more it grew on me the location was excellent just round the back of schwedenplatz about mins walk to the centre of vienna but it was also really quiet the bed was very comfy and had perfect soft feather pillows the staff were extrememly helpful they booked a concert for us and gave us lots of information they would get in my book although the breafast bar was not very big which concerned us when we saw it the night before there was lots of choice and it was all really fresh also there were no tea and coffee making facilities in our room which was quite surprising but free tea and coffee was available from the breakfast room all day which made up for it
