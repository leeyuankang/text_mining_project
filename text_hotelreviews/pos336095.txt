this hotel is located minute from the metro station and minutes walking to the centre it s a small hotel with small rooms but everything is clean and functions correctly if anything negative could be said it would be the lack of cold water pressure in the basin in the bathroom the breakfast was sufficient the bath came equipped with a hydromassage good wifi connection throughout the hotel nice and friendly staff overall a good hotel at an acceptable price
