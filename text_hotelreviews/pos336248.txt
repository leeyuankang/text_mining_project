we were upgraded to although it was a double bed we were ladies sharing having originally booked a twin we thought the upgrade would have been better we should have stayed with a twin the room was stuffy and we couldn t open the window and we re not ac fans it was also very noisy we could hear the next door guest using their bathroom the last time we stayed at flemings we had an apartment so obviously this time we were disappointed with the accommodation but it s still a great hotel
