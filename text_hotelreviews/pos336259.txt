the quaint style of the hotel is a refreshing change from the standard contemporary offering so many hotels deliver today the staff were appreciative that we were not from london and assisted in every way possible the room although on the small side was immaculate and extremely well presented if you want to get away from the archetypal getaway hotel and experience something more traditional yet still holding modern service this hotel is for you also the location is perfect for a short stay tourist and the price point is more than fair
