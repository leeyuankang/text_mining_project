i cannot fault this hotel in any way recently stayed in the studio suite and was amazed by the generous size of the room and all the features the staff are amazing always professional and cannot do enough for you our luggage was stored before check in and at check out allowing us to explore the city without any hassle great location beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable i will definitely be returning on my next trip to london
