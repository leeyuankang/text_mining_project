this was the perfect weekend go to london multiple times per year and always like to try new and star hotels every now and then this one is definitely going to my list of stay again when traveling there the hotel is amazing and everyone is super nice the hotel is very clean beds are very comfy staff is very friendly and helpful didn t get a chance to go the restaurant but will definitely come back again and try it got an upgrade on arrival which made the weekend even better from all the stars hotels in central london this is by far one of my favorites
