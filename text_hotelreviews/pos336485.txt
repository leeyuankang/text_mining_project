we had a fabulous time at this hotel it was undergoing refurbishment to upgrade to a michellin star but the room we were in was brilliant the staff were really friendly and helpful the location was fabulous all attractions were in easy reach and just around the corner is an abundance of pubs and restaurants in shepherds market would definitely recommend especially when makeover completed
