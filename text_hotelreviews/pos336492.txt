i could not find anything negative about my stay i knew breakfast would need to be brought to my room due to some discrete internal building and decorating which affected the dining room this did not spoil my enjoyment of breakfast the tray was absolutely loaded with so many different items of food expected in a continental breakfast the fruit salad was particularly good
