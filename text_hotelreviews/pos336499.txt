fabulous great location beautiful hotel and extremely helpful and genuinely friendly staff amazing value for money the concierge showed me to my room and offered me a cup or tea which was brought up instantly and not added to my bill and they waived the two bottles of water i took from the mini bar really nice and thoughtful touches
