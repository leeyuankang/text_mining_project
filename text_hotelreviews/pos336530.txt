the location was great the staff were super friendly and efficient have never had coffee brought so quickly in the morning nothing was too much trouble i had asked the concierge in the morning to have my car ready after a meeting at and it was waiting for me no fuss will certainly stay there next time was also really quiet at night and no traffic noise which for london is unusual
