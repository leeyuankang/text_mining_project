the staff here were amazing really could not do enough to help you also the receptionist made sure that there was a lovely treat in our room for my girlfriends birthday was so nice and felt so welcome that we actually stayed and had a drink in the hotel instead of going out for a mayfair hotel the drinks and food is very resonably priced as well
