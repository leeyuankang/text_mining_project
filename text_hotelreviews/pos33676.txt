i know rooms are slightly different in size but i got a big clean room and a big bathroom for france the staff were nice and cleaning staff even gave me back something my parents left in their room as i was staying an extra night beds were firm and rooms although a bit red were nicely decorated modern bathrooms great shower pressure and hot water location was convenient if you want to stay near the gare du nord or gare de l est there are also metro stations very close to the hotel i would come back again
