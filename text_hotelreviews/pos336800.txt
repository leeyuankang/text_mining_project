we were not able to be accommodated for our first night but we were contacted and informed before our arrival and upgraded to hilton park lane fabulous staff very apologetic for the inconvenience both hotel locations were great for our needs close to hyde park and other london attractions and within walking distance very helpful and friendly staff great breakfasts included
