location excellent breakfast lovely room location at the front of hotel smokers below our window outside and smoke drifted in to our room on several occasions not pleasant at all staff on reception appeared abrupt upon leaving bill was handed over no social interaction not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay which would have prompted me to mention the smoking issue
