location was excellent we had a power cut on our first night and the staff handled this very professionally and couldnt have done more for us we were moved to the park lane hilton for one night and were given complimentary drinks vouchers and received an apology letter with a box of sweets when we arrived back at our hotel the green park hilton is smaller and the staff are much more friendlier than park lane and the location is more central
