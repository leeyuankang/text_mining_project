the staff were very helpful breakfast plenty of choice bed very comfortable but pillows need updating and only one cushion on chair which used to bulk out the flat pillows on the bed lived the oversized bathrobes my husband can never get the robes to fit him so he was very happy with this the surrounding area is fantastic too buckingham palace just through the pack was a bonus thank you for a wonderful stay
