from the moment we stepped into the hotel staff could not do enough to make you feel welcome we stayed nights and all members of staff called us by name attention to detail was driven as a priority the breakfast was superb room quiet and very comfortable the concierge was very helpful even managed to get motown the musical tickets for saturday night rows from the front at a reasonable price great location to all events hyde park and close to buck house green park and oxford street just a min walk away
