so glad we chose cadogan gardens for a very quick trip to london the staff were wonderful and nothing was ever too much trouble very importantly our bed was a true king size and extremely comfortable the bathroom was a tad on the squeezy side but that is england we got used to it and found it charming the location is perfect walking distance to sloane square tube station and lots of fantastic restaurants nearby i really couldn t fault it and would highly recommend
