the way the staff treated us all the time and always tried to excell in having us satisfied the concierge team was always helpful and gave us great restaurant suggestions even when we asked in the ladt minute the breakfast in the room as after a couple of breakfasts downstairs we preferred to have it in the room when they got to know what we were doing in a day e g going to a show in a theather they would prepare something related to it for when we were back to the room another example is that the concierge arranged a nice alternative city tour for us as we were with the kids and the nice tour guide took a picture of our family when we got back to the hotel they had the picture framed as a surprise for us
