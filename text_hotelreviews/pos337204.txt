exceptional service from the moment we stepped in the door the accommodation was excellent and the view of hyde park and london from our hotel room was spectacular the celebratory gift of champagne and strawberries for our honeymoon and the rolls royce courtesy car were a particular treat thanks to manon and all the staff at four seasons for making our stay so special
