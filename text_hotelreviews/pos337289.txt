close to ernst happel stadium for the concert we had pre booked nice danube waterfront location great for watching the river cruise ships go by visiting beach bars and restaurants on the danube island and visiting the danube tower tip visit the tower after to visit the cafe without a reservation and watch people bungee off the tower whilst you relax with a white wine spritzer tea and coffee making facilities in the room great surf and turf meal in the restaurant small but adequate pool area which is in complete shade in the afternoon this was great for us as it was very hot during our stay in june great view from our water view room we chose water view as people had commented on train noise on the city side of the hotel
