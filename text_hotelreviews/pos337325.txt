room was clean spacious fixtures to a high standard with large comfy beds lighting gave a nice mood in the room where there was a mini bar fridge and coffee making facilities bathroom bright and spotless with usual toiletries our room had river view which was lovely staff friendly efficient we were given vouchers on arrival for a free drink in the restaurant which was a relaxing place with a good atmosphere excellent food and reasonably priced i would recommend it arriving at vienna airport get the bus from stop outside for just over euro s it s minutes to stadion this is the circular shopping mall and minutes walk to hotel look out for signposts for hilton this hotel is a bit out of the centre but the train station is only a minute walk and trains seem to run at minute intervals if going to the opera or theatre don t stress about getting too dressed up smart casual is fine though jeans and trainers were apparent overall vienna was a fabulous experience
