i loved my stay at this beautifully located hotel on the danube river as a solo traveller i felt perfectly safe and very welcome the food in both the bar and restaurant was unusually good and i chose to have almost all of my meals there the king sized riverfront room was huge and comfortable a bonus was the enormous window that opened wide so that there was a sense of having a balcony it was interesting to watch all of the river traffic going by including many river cruises i also loved the pool
