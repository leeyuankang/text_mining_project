the room was clean spacious and faced the danube the bathroom facilities and towels were great staff was very professional and made every effort to make our stay comfortable giving directions and providing other amenities had they not been full they would have allowed us to check in early however they did store our luggage so we could go out and explore vienna during the day we ate dinner in the bar that evening but they also have a restaurant on site if i were able to visit vienna again i would not hesitate to go back compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip it was an excellent value for the money
