my cousin and i arrived at the hotel early in the morning thinking we would have to just leave our bags and wait for check in time until later but when we arrived they told me our room was ready at the staff was friendly room was big and clean loved the view from the room when we were checking out we needed a taxi to bring us to the airport i called the front desk and she had a taxi there for us in minutes i would stay here again if i ever get the opportunity to go back to austria
