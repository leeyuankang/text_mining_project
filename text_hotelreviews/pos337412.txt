what extra can i say about this hilton hotel it was superb the rooms tastefully decorated with all the space and storage you could want the bathroom facility beautifully done and so clean the bar and the breakfast dining area just perfect not located right in the centre of vienna is within easy access to the underground system that know where is out of reach the bi lingual staff were so friendly and helpful i would hesitate to use the term staff they were more like your best friend the breakfast was quite stunning a massive amount of choice and so beautifully presented unbeatable breakfast outside right alongside the danube on a warm summers morning was something to be experienced i know that in the hilton hotels you get what you pay for but as far as some hiltons are concerned this was very affordable and reasonably priced it is hard to imagine somewhere better a footnote to the people who work at this hilton thank you for making our stay so comfortable and memorable it didn t go unnoticed
