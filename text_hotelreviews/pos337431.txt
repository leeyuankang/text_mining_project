beds were very comfortable rooms were very spacious and clean restaurant and bar on site although it was raining this is a beautiful place to eat at outside as it is right on the danube river parking very easy i was nervous with it not being in the center of vienna but even with the rain the walk to the subway station was very easy and the subway was easy to use and cheap it is near the stadion center which is a mall we went there for breakfast to the bakery deli place which was delicious
