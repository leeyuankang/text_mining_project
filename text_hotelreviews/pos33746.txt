fantastic location in the heart of chelsea but on the quietest street a small group of houses converted to a non stuffy star hotel i was given a very large completely renovated room and think i scored a great price here espresso maker in the room beautiful bath spotless thick towels turn down service quiet great decor it was warm in london and the air conditioning was awesome cool quiet and didn t freeze you out short walk to the tube never used the common rooms or restaurant bar etc but they all looked cozy and high tea looked delicious from what i could tell very friendly staff will stay here again
