we stayed in a junior suite with access to executive lounge and it was incredible value for money the room was enormous and overlooked the danube the facilities of the executive lounge made us feel a real sense of luxury as we had access to complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the day the sitting out areas were very modern and trendy staff were all friendly and attentive there is an outdoor swimming pool with robes towels supplied eating dinner on the terrace at night with the occasional boat sailing by on the danube was quite magical
