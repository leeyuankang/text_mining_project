very helpful staff willing to assist which always makes the difference for the busy location the room was quiet and comfy the lovely wallpaper is a standout giving the room an eclectic feel appreciated the complimentary drinking water but that only appeared the night of my night stay comfy bed and excellent choice of pillows
