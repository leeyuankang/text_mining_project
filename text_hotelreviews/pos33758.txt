lovely stay in a comfortable and cosy room the room was a little smaller than used to as had two large suitcases but beautiful otherwise only stayed for two nights and didn t really explore the rest of the hotel until checking out wish i had done this earlier as a beautiful establishment concierge was extremely helpful and friendly
