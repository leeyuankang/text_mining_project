the hotel was very modern and clean the location was excellent literally minutes away from north ealing tube station on the piccadilly line central london is minutes away on the tube they left two free bottles of water in my room each day which i really appreciated there was also a mini bar in the room so it was very handy to have the use of a fridge free wifi which again i appreciated massive tv on the wall
