felt nice and cosy and had a very nice feel when you walked up to your room everywhere looked liked it was decorated by someone who actually thought about it rather than a large chain who have a lot of green carpet left or a endless supply of grey paint room was small and a little quirky but had everything needed a very nice ensuite and a comfy bed each room was also air conditioned and free wifi throughout staff were friendly and we both had a very relaxing weekend
