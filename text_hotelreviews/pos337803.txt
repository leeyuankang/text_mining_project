the location of the hotel was great only minutes walk from north ealing station i liked the hotel d cor and the friendly and warm welcome from receptionist tiberius hope i ve got his name right on my arrival i was upgraded from a street view room to a garden view room that had just been recently decorated it was lovely a little on the small side but was absolutely fine for one person i felt very comfortable there and the breakfast was lovely too overall i would highly recommend this hotel
