liked how the train station was literally a minute away me and my sister went to london to see beyonc at wembley and it was in an ber which the hotel has off vouchers which we used on the way back as was higher price due to traffic coming out of the concert so many leaflets and discount cards for loads of places and attractions in london the staff were lovely brought us fresh bottled water and extra tea and anything else we needed also check out was early but our coach home was a night coach so they happily held our luggage with them whilst we went for a day sight seeing around london they couldn t of done anymore only thing was the tea and coffee shelf kept falling in the wardrobe but we told them and they offered to send someone straight up but we advised it wasn t causing an issue so was no need don t let the road outside put you off if you get a road facing room it didn t bother us and we had a great nights here
