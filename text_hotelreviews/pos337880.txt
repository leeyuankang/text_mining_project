a quaint little place the room was lovely for the price very clean and tasteful we loved the fact that we were left completely undisturbed and could wonder in and out of the garden all night if we wanted a cigarette staff very polite and pleasant i honestly could not find a fault with the place we also got upgraded for free to garden view room definitely will use this place again a lovely stay
