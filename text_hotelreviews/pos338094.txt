very pretty hotel very quiet breakfast was good location could be better since it does not have the best public transportation links still quite good and a very pleasant area for walking not a lot of quality dining options although the pizza corta at the end of the road did serve a quality risotto even though the ambiance of the place was a bit low rent to explore vienna by foot and public transport there are better located hotels
