very nice and clean hotel situated not far from the bus tram station we have stayed several times in vienna in different places we found the hotel good value for the money location and services the staff very friendly smiley and helpful good choice at breakfast and some gut things to eat at lunch time or dinner if you are in hotel the room clean well decorated though a little small for a family with members but perfect for a couple they offer cookies and tea in the afternoon which is very nice from a hotel we enjoyed the quiet of the hotel
