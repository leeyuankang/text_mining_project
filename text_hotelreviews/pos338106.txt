checked the property on tripadvisor really enjoyed the hotel good location quiet but close to attractions very welcoming and most helpful staff the breakfast was one of the best i ve had on travels would definitely stay at this hotel again greatly added to my wife s and my experience in vienna afternoon tea and cake courtesy of the hotel was a nice touch
