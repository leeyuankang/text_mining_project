we loved this hotel the staff working the front desk was really friendly and helped us with everything from maps to public transportation tips our room was very clean with modern fixtures and an extremely comfortable bed we also had control of our a c which can be rare in austria but we loved this the gym is decent size and the breakfast each morning is delicious lots of organic and healthy choices plenty of drinks meats breads and a yogurt bar the hotel is a littler far from the city center but we walked one day and rented bikes the next their is a city bike rental right down from the hotel near the parking garage and i highly recommend it we had a blast
