this is the best hotel in our city tour of europe and ranks as one of the best in my travels across cities in the world the hotel is not in the centre of vienna but is an oasis in vienna after a hard days touring we used uber rather than public transport and most fares were even from the eastern side of vienna the rooms are not huge but the facilities are impeccable and modern and the decor is ultra contemporary and pleasing the hotel has so many pluses that i will not be able to cover them all but to start with the rooms are superbly decorated and extremely comfortable there is air conditioning a well appointed en suite comfortable bed and large screen tv there is also a minibar and tea coffee making facilities i asked for western style pillows and the maid arrived within minutes with a selection of pillows the hotel offers a hot and cold buffet breakfast with staff taking orders for tea coffee or hot chocolate if you are around in the afternoon the hotel provides free refreshments and cake check in is perfect and the lift is modern and quick a very pleasant stay
