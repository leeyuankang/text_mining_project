we loved the decor in both the guest lounge area bedroom the room bathroom were modern with lots of light the breakfast was excellent with a large variety of choices from cereals continental breakfast to hot breakfast the staff were attentive helpful the location was good for us as we enjoy being a little out of the city centre we loved the local eateries and the variety available within walking distance of the hotel wonderful stay
