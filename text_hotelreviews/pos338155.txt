we enjoyed our time in vienna staying at the best western harmonie it was well located within an easy walk to the main part of the city the room was quiet clean with very comfortable beds we especially enjoyed having a fitness center available to us until midnight the breakfasts were amazing with so many choices and great coffee we enjoyed being in district one because we felt like locals not tourists we also enjoyed visiting freud s museum which was a minute walk away when we return to vienna we plan to stay here again
