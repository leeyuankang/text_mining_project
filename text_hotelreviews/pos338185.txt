we cannot fault this quiet friendly hotel it provided more than we anticipated for a very reasonable price the bed was extremely comfortable like sleeping on a cloud and the breakfast was excellent with local organic produce and a choice of eating al fresco complimentary tea and cake was a nice touch in the afternoon the hotel is an excellent base for exploring the city of vienna and close to public transport for wider travel to salzburg and bratislava
