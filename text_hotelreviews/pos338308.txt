the bed was really comfortable and your swimming pool is just the right temperature and a great length for doing laps so i was very pleased to be able to keep up my fitness regime also having a bath is great it helps to be able to relax at the end of a day with some bubbles i also stayed in close to amsterdam for a couple of days and i enjoyed having a change being in the commercial centre with the local supermarkets and cafes the tram was close and quick to get to the city centre and the sights
