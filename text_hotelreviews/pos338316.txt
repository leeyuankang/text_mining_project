great location good restaurant bar and patio on site check in service was fast and efficient with staff friendly and knowledgeable we had a large party people and the hotel added extra staff on a couple of occasions to help accommodate us both in the restaurant and on the patio which was greatly appreciated and made our stay very family friendly great accommodations overall the hotel also included an interior pool sauna and spa as well and i would definitely recommend staying at this hotel and if given the opportunity will return very classy modern accommodations
