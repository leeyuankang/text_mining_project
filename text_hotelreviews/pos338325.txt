the transport via the tram was very simple to use it was only a minute walk and on a safe road the link to the airport was good although we did get a bit mixed up when we first arrived fine going back to the airport though the hotel was lovely and the staff were very pleasant too the triple room we had was great for space and comfort amsterdam is a great cityto visit and i d definately return i d stay at this hotel too
