we stayed at the westcord on the last night of our honeymoon and only night in amsterdam when we arrived back at the hotel to go to sleep we received a beautiful bottle of champagne roses and chocolate covered strawberries with turn down service it was the perfect touch to the end of the perfect honeymoon thank you to the staff at the westcord for making our night so special
