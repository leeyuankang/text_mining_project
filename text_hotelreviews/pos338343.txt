hotel is lovely and the staff are great its clean and very stylish lots to choose from at breakfast the restaurant and bar is nice would recommend getting the tram into central amsterdam as it is only a short journey and a lot cheaper to do it this way we were getting cabs on the first day and only discovered the tram on the second day
