everyone we met at the hotel from front desk to housekeeping was very friendly and helpful they made us feel really welcome after an overnight hour flight it was such a bonus to find that they had a room available so we could check in right away for a recuperating nap before heading out to explore the city room was clean bed comfortable breakfast offered a wide variety of delicious quality food some had said that the hotel s distance from the tram station is a disadvantage actually the min stroll we did everyday was quite enjoyable provided the weather is fine overall i rate my experience with westcord fashion even better than with some of the more expensive downtown star hotels next time i will choose them again
