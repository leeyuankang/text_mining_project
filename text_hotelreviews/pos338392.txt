rooms were excellent and the skyy bar was a great place to finish off an evening for the most part the staff were helpful and courteous the hotel was located near a tram stop for easy access into the city centre if you want to stay out in amsterdam until later in the evening after the trams have stopped i wouldn t recommend this hotel as a taxi back from the centre is rather expensive but it suited our purposes
