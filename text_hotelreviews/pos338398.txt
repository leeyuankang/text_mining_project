the bed was so comfy as were the pillows the facilities in the room were excellent lovely bathroom with separate bath shower clean towels everyday we paid to include breakfast in our stay and it was certainly value for money so much to choose from and set us up for the day the hotel was only minutes from the city centre by tram tram or and you can can purchase a tram card from the hotel which was value for money it was a minute walk to catch the tram from the hotel all the staff from the receptionist to housekeepers were lovely and helpful nothing was to much trouble for them one of the best hotels i ve stayed in and would definitely stay there again
