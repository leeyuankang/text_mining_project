we were recommended this hotel by two separate couples and i m glad we took their advice when you first step into the hotel you re in a very impressive colourful and modern reception with friendly and helpful staff at both the reception and elsewhere in the hotel the food and drinks were delicious and the rooms were tasteful clean and felt very designer the hotel s location is exactly right its about minutes from central station via the tram and i d definitely recommend the tram with their or hour passes you get to see a lot more of the city and have a better idea of how to find everything you re looking for
