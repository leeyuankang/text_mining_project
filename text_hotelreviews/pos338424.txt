the rooms were really comfortable staff were really friendly and helpful if you ask at reception they will give you a number for a pizza delivery restaurant that deliver throughout the night so if ever your still up peckish in the night then they are the best people to call for your midnight feast we ordered after am and they came so quickly the hotel is located in a really a peaceful area
