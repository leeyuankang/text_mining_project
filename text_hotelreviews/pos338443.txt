the hotel was excellent value for money the rooms were better than value and the staff were extremely friendly the only slight catch we found was the location a tram ride was necessary to get into the main locations of amsterdam however we did walk to vondelpark one day and then to the centre and although a lengthy walk there was a lot to see and it was a lovely experience
