check in was smooth staff were polite and it was a speedy process we had a twin room and it is a lot smaller than the images portray but this wasn t a major problem we settled in easily and the views from the room were nice and calm although overpriced the breakfast buffet was lovely there was a nice variety we figured it worked out cheaper and better than getting a taxi to a get breakfast as the hotel is isolated from everything not in central amsterdam the pool is small and the changing areas are awful no privacy no lockers and one tiny shower there unfortunately were children s swimming lessons going on during our stay so several of us including children boys and girls were cramped into the whole spa area the hotel should keep such events separate from when hotel guests can use the spa facilities overall the stay was pleasant and the hotel served its purpose
