the hotel itself was lovely and all the staff was very welcoming the room was clean modern and comfortable the beds was huge and defiantly fit for a good night sleep i couldn t fault the hotel or room itself bar location our telly had broken the first day so we had rang down to reception and they replaced it straight away no problems the room service was also outstanding the hotel was quiet and calm considering it being on the edge of a highway
