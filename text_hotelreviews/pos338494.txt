wow such a great hotel we arrived hours ahead of check in time but our room was ready for us so it was great to be able to get into the room quicker than expected we received a complimentary bottle of prosecco and two roses to mark our wedding anniversary such a lovely touch the room itself was gorgeous very modern and a shower and a bath free wifi without the hotel the hotel is immaculate and there was literally nothing that could have made our stay more enjoyable would visit again
