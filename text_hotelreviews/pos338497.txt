nothing to complain about everything was excellent hotel is easy to reach from the airport using the train it s located away from the more tourist areas but they are all easily accessible via the tram staff all very friendly and efficient room was a decent size tastefully decorated and most importantly spotlessly clean good facilities within the hotel skybar on the floor very enjoyable i will certainly use this hotel again
