the bed was really comfy bathroom glass door was very unique the staff were very friendly and helpful also felt very secure as only way you could get into building at night you needed your room card to scan in me and my partner also loved the sky bar was open til at the weekend which was good it was a fantastic stay and would definitely stay again
