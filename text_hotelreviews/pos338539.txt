fresh contemporary and different loved our room loved that the toilet was separate from the shower and bath lovely deep bath and walk in shower really comedy bed the bar was lovely and the lady took an interest in us and our reasons for staying fashions restaurant the food was great real care and attention had gone into the food almost fine dining quality food was disappointed a little by the sky bar after reading and the hotel staff saying we should go we went and i felt the staff did not really pay us great attention the cocktail was mediocre and the smell from the grill was off putting we were there to celebrate a special occasion and didn t feel special there should have stayed in the downstairs bar where we were more looked after pool was lovely didn t use the sauna steam didn t want to pay extra did have a treatment which was lovely
