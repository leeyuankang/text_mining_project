great stay at westcord loved the fun fashion decor online photos don t do it justice the bedroom was very clean lovely smellies included bed was comfortable yet firm staff friendly and helpful very easy to get into town either on the tram or a beautiful stroll through the park to the museum district perfect for aiding digestion of the yummy buffet breakfast short taxi ride to airport
