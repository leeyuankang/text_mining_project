the bed was one of the comfiest hotel beds i ve stayed in and i ve been to a fair few staff were very attentive and spoke great english and very helpful in helping tourists navigate their way around great facilities and i honestly couldn t recommend this hotel more such a great location and room brilliant if it s your first time to amsterdam tram just down the road and can purchase tickets at reception close to city centre and trams running until back to hotel
