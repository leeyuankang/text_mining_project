westcord fashion hotel was fantastic i chose to stay slightly out of the centre of amsterdam and this meant we could afford a nicer hotel three minutes takes you to surinameplaine tram stop and the or tram takes you into the centre in about minutes the trams run every minutes which is great buy the hour travel cards from reception and get on or off any tram any time the day card was only vondelpark is nearby and this is a lovely walk into the centre if you have an hour to spare the pool was lovely and our room was kept clean every day with all toiletries replaced daily although we didn t eat in the hotel we did use the sky rooftop bar every night service was great and although the cocktails are expensive enough at they were lovely and the beer was a good price as it was my husband s i let the hotel know and we arrived to our room to find a voucher for a complimentary cocktail each in the sky bar we really appreciated this the hotel also stored our baggage after check out until we were ready to go to the airport if we go back to amsterdam and we probably will as we loved it we would definitely stay at westcord fashion hotel again
