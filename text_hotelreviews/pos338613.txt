for the price i love this hotel which is why we stayed here for a second time it is in the perfect location to get to the train and you can also walk around and discover the neighborhood that is surrounding the hotel the hotel has a cool bar that has a good dj and the drinks are also amazing i cant think of a reason not to stay here they also have bikes for rental
