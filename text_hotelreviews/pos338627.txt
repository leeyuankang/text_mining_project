the staff were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay which was great and made us feel at ease the breakfast buffet was really nice they had loads of different foods and was very fresh the hotel is only a few stops on the metro to the city centre and stops from the hotel to the airport by train overall this hotel is the perfect hotel for any stay they have everything you need and a great overall location to stay i would recommend to anyone
