i have visited amsterdam times over the last years and each time i have stayed at this hotel it is a little further out but the centre is accessible via tram or bike what i like about the hotel is that you get good value for money a spacious well designed room with good modern features nespresso machine simple fridge plus a standard of hygiene that satisfies a clean freak like me the cleaning staff are very good as they do an excellent job of achieving a nice clean room it helps that the fixture and fittings are simple modern and of good design there are also some very good local shops and restaurants near the hotel on the south end of vondelpark which are a min walk from the hotel visit blauw which is an exceptional modern indonesian restaurant
