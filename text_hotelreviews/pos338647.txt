great stay at this hotel in a quiet location away from the hustle bustle of the centre easily accessible by tram with stop minutes from hotel another mins walk to local bars restaurants we purchased a travel pass from reception which was great value for money skyy bar was great for tapas cocktails cocktails a bit pricey though staff at skyy bar were excellent great selection st breakfast although my daughter was a bit disappointed that the only yogurt selection was natural in a large bowl our room was spacious comfy with plenty of amenities would be nice to have a restaurant bar menu in room would thoroughly recommend the west cord fashion
