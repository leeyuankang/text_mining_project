the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in it was a very spacious room the location is ideal minutes from airport when using the train and then minute walk to the tram to get to the centre which was only about a minute journey we rented bikes for one day which was very cheap and cycled through vondelpark we never had food at the hotel so can t comment on that
