we stayed on floor with view over the rembrant park bed was huge and probably one of best i ve slept in room had a nespresso machine but you only got pods and milks per day seems weird for people there was ice machine on our floor but no ice bucket supplied so you have to ask food in restaurant was top class and can recommend the chicken satay and tagliatelli with salmon not cheap but nowhere decent is skyy bar was also very expensive most cocktails around euros for breakfast go to cafe oslo which is fantastic also good for dinner this is nearest best cafe
