the staff were really friendly from the moment we arrived we arrived with another couple so wanted to be on the same floor and they managed to arrange this for us which we was very grateful for the hotel itself is so beautiful went for lunch at the restaurant on the terrace and the view was spectacular our room was on the floor which i appreciated as i love higher rooms and the room was nice and clean the bed was really comfortable and spacious loved the bath shower room and the lighting in the room was good too so i was able to do my makeup without having to go in the bathroom this hotel has a lot to offer although it s not in the centre it s only two trains away so doesn t take long at all
