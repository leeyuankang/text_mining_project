enjoyed everything my room was quiet nice and clean i have also appreciated the water boiler the nespresso machine and the three coffee capsules and two tea bags per day breakfast is of good quality and variety the swimming pool is about meters long it is very good for a hotel pool if you like swimming a bit water temperature was very good too the hotel is not in the centre this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the case an advantage is that you are not in the middle of the main touristic routes with the associated chaos a disadvantage is that there are not many restaurants at walking distance beyond the hotel restaurant which is however not bad although selection is quite limited anyway the restaurants available in the neighbourhood are not exclusively targeted to tourists and this is a pro for me walking to the damrak is about min tram stop to from the centre is about min walking with a tram you can reach the damrak in around min the hotel is at so at walking distance from the amsterdam lelylaan train station which you can easily reach from to the schiphol airport journey from to the airport is very short around min
