the aesthetic of this hotel is stunning it s truly gorgeous it s got a hip and trendy vibe that is sexy and mature it s really close to the tram which makes for a quick ride into the city center and it s only about minutes by taxi from the airport so that s rather convenient they also prepared a take away breakfast for us because of our early flight which was really considerate
