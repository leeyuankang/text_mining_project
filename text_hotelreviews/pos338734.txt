comfortable beds quiet rooms we slept like babies very clean and coffee was well stocked we appreciated that room keys were required to operate the lift and an entry door to the floors although it seemed the door on the opposite end of the hall was left open there was excellent lighting in the rooms and all materials were quality also liked that it was away from the crowds of the city
