excellent location friendly staff and good food we paid extra for a spa package that included evening meal breakfast and spa access we expected the evening meal to be fairly std table d hote fair but it was more akin to a fine dining experience unexpected and great value spa was great to relax after some long days sigtseeing close enough to airport to use train to arrive and right on a tram stop to get into the city
