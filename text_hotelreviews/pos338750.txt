the staff were very welcoming and helpful our room was clean and well appointed it was especially helpful to have facilities for making coffee tea the skyy bar floor was fun we had very good meals in the informal bar restaurant on two evenings and an absolutely splendid meal in the formal restaurant on our final evening cannot emphasise enough just how high the standard of presentation and cuisine were in relation to the latter we would happily stay at the hotel again despite the fact that it is not in the centre of amsterdam using the trams numbers and and about as frequent as it is possible for a service to be became just part of the experience this hotel was far less expensive than those more centrally located but it proved to be as indicated above a choice we were most happy with
