the room was spotless modern and quite large which was helpful since we were traveling with our granddaughter the staff was so accommodating we were able to get tickets and information which decreased our wait times we were near tram and train stops so we could easily get to the airport and city center quickly the westcord fashion hotel was a great choice for us we would definitely stay there again
