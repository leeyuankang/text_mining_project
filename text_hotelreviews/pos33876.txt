the junior suite was exceptional hour butler service spacious bathroom with both bath and shower the bed was extremely comfortable the hotel itself is really well maintained and to a very high standard the staff were very friendly and most importantly very helpful the chauffeur driven rolls royce was a nice touch to help us get to harrods for some afternoon tea and shopping would highly recommend this hotel
