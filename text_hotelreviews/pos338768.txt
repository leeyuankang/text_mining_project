travelling with two teenage children we booked two rooms which were across the corridor from each other rooms were comfortable well appointed and quiet the pool and gym were a real addition and meant we could have some down time in between sightseeing etc the food was really good although we generally ate out the hotel has bicycles to hire a great way to get into the centre we cycled through the vondelpark which was lovely early in the morning our teenagers were very happy they thought it was cool and comfy the wi fi was fast too great hotel super helpful staff we d definitely go back
