the hotel was very modern with good facilities we had brought the wrong plug converters and they supplied us with some so as we could use our devices free wifi with a good connection too lovely bathrooms although if you re a new couple maybe not as the door is see through in the bath and shower private toilet however it is near to a motorway but the hotel is very soundproof tram line within a two minute walk so easy access to the city quick minutes into dam square lovely location nice dining area and also a lovely warm comfy smoking area beds were super comfy lots of room for clothes decent tv ice machine on every floor good coffee machine really can t fault it this is our time in amsterdam we have also stayed in the hilton here but this hotel was a lot better
