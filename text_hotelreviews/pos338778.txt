just recently got back from a stay here in amsterdam on arrival the staff were extremely nice and welcoming having not paid a tremendous amount for two nights here my expectations weren t high however i was very pleasantly surprised the room was stunning decent size large bed and very clean the en suite bathroom was of a good size with a lovely bath and separate shower the coffee maker in the room was my best friend in the morning would definitely stay here again couldn t have gotten a better hotel for the money we paid
