room was very modern and comfortable all staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate you the sky bar was great to relax and drinks reasonably priced the proximity to the tram stop made it really easy and cheap to get around just a minute walk to get the tram and you can use it go all over the city if you purchase a hour ticket for euros from the hotel desk it covers you for a weekend
