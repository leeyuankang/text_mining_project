we loved this hotel it s really modern and clean and looks very stylish the staff were lovely and always very helpful you can buy your tram and bus tickets at reception which is great and so cheap less than for four days unlimited travel even though it may look like the hotel is quite far out of town it s only a five minute walk from a tram stop surinam also it s one train stop lelyan away from the airport which takes only mins from there you take the tram to surinam and it s a five min walk so easy also we really liked this area it s close to vondelpark and to the museum quarter so there are lots of nice places to explore our room was really clean and comfy with a great bed and the shower was really powerful one of the best ever and the room price was really reasonable we would definitely come back
