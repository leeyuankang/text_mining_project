the hotel decor is really nice room service and reception are helpful in getting almost anything you need for your stay the rooms are laid out to look pretty plush and the artwork around the hotel is wonderful food was at a good standard you could eat in at the hotel and have a great meal the wellness centre downstairs is wonderful i even forgot to bring shorts and they managed to sort me out with a pair for the pool the staff even surprised us with roses chocolates strawberries and prosecco in our room after letting them know the purpose of our visit was for our anniversary it was literally needed after the nightmare journey from london to amsterdam overall wonderful stay and would recommend
