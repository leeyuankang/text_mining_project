the staff were very friendly and helpful right from check in to check out comfortable rooms very clean and we enjoyed having access to the pool and fitness suite breakfast good variety and fairly good quality we visited amsterdam with my brother and his wife to celebrate his birthday we were given a voucher for free cocktails at skyy bar a nice gesture very good food drinks at both lobby restaurant and skyy bar location was out of the main city centre but tram stop very close by with and providing great access to lots of attractions did not get a chance to use the bikes available for hire but they would be another good option for getting around only a short drive from the airport overall good value for money particularly since it was during new year weekend first time staying in a westcord would definitely stay again
