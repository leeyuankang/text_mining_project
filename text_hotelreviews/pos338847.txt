large rooms very comfortable bathroom area and large comfy bed also near enough to center to travel everyday around mins to central station but far enough that you can escape the noise and busyness of the centre when you wish t is also easy to get to and from the airport nice food at the lobby bar and good room service enough satellite channels to find something to watch nice espresso machine and good amount of cupboard space for a hotel will stay there again if we return to amsterdam
