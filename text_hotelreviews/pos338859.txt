this was my second time staying at the westcord fashion hotel and i must honestly say i would go back a third the staff are friendly and very helpful the hotel on a whole is clean tidy the rooms are fantastic i like the fact that the toilet is separate to the bathroom also having the option of being able to soak in the bath or have a shower is brilliant the beds are amazing and very comfortable the indoor swimming pool and sauna facilities was also great bonus whilst staying there
