my husband and i visited the hotel for our honeymoon over a long weekend we love amsterdam but this hotel just out of the centre was the most perfect way to enjoy amaterdam and have place to escape to the hotel have missed nothing out the food is so are the staff and the comfort of the bedrooms where second to non not to mention the nespresso machine in the room everywhere you look in this hotel there s little touches to even more comfort you through your stay above all literally the sky bar is fantastic great music atmosphere and oh the cocktails absolutely to die for
