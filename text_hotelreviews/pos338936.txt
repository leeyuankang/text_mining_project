not very central but less than a five minute walk from a tram that gets you to the centre in less than minutes we had bad weather and the wind broke the hotel umbrellas but the staff laughed it off and replaced them straight away which was great the skyy bar had a great atmosphere and really funny staff and the restaurant was spot on for a relaxed dinner
