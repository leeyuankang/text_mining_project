the bed was extremely comfy and the decor of the room was very classy lovely vintage touches like the phone and radio and huge windows with beautiful views also the room was much bigger than i thought the photos do not do the hotel justice the staff were more than happy to help with anything giving us maps and drawing easiest routes to get to places and suggesting good places to visit also even though breakfast not included you get a breakfast bag in morning with banana granola and orange juice which was a lovely touch will definitely be returning
