i wasn t expecting to be staying in amsterdam i was supposed to be flying to mexico city but air traffic control failure at schiphol left me overnighting in amsterdam rather than stay at klm s designated soulless airport hotel i asked to stay in town i m familiar with the hoxton in shoreditch so deciding where to stay was easy it s a cool hotel and it ticks all the boxes my room was small but perfectly formed wifi was fast and reliable the restaurant and bar area is excellent with a good atmosphere best bits there s a bottle bar for residents to take a beer to the room a breakfast bag is included in the room rate hang the bag outside your door and they ll leave you some yoghurt fruit and juice
