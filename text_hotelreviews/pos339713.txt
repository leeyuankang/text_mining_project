great job of taking a tired hotel in a great location and completely revitalizing it super new mechanicals top quality shower worked into the usual compact bathroom double pane windows that open fully i had a sunny courtyard room no view but very pleasant vintage scandinavian reading chair that could not have been more comfortable good pillows good bed they took a smallish room and made it really comfortable efficient and stylish in a kind of retro mid century way it felt more like a good guest room at a friend s house than a hotel room will never be confused with a holiday inn
