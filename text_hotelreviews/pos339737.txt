the hotel is gorgeous and it s only a minute walk to the main square it s easy to find your way back too as well as its on one of the main canal rings so you can just follow them until you find it again the room was really nice too it s quirky and finished to a really high standard too we loved to vintage photo booth too we took photos every day of our trip
