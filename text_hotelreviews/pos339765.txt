style and atmosphere of the hotel it feels much more like a residence than a hotel staff are exceptionally friendly and cool bedrooms very nice even the tiny ones and the beds unbelievably comfortable free wifi and phone calls a nice touch that seem simple but many hotels i ve travelled to use them to get a few more euros out of their guests food is very high quality too best steak i had in amsterdam after trying a few supposedly famous steak houses
