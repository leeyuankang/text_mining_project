the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful we had a cosy double room which we expected to be small but it wasn t at all probably the wrong name for the room the communal area had a great buzz and was used by lots of different people both hotel residents and locals alike we hadn t booked breakfast but a light breakfast was still delivered to the room
