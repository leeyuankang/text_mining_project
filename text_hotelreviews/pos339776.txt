great vibe as soon as you walked in everything was exactly as the pictures showed on the internet not a large hotel but that s what we like close to all forms of transport or easy walking to the centre of the city loved the bed so comfortable loved the bathroom in particular the heated towel rail the idea of the free calls for an hour to anywhere in the world is great also loved the free brown bag breakfast
