everything about the hoxton was top notch but especially the staff at the front desk we stayed for a week and every person we had contact with was professional helpful friendly and just plain fun to talk with the other best thing about the hoxton for us was the location it was in a perfect location neighborhood with plenty of terrific restaurants and within walking distance to all of the sights the hoxton has a lot going on including a lively entertainment bar area that was hopping most of the time at night maybe weekend nights only not sure there was a dj we had been in a first floor room and were awakened to the beat of the bass thankfully it ended at midnight the next morning we asked if it was possible to be moved to a higher floor hoping it would be quieter and they were able to accommodate our request we enjoyed our stay very much
