the staff are particularly welcoming and helpful that made such a difference when we first arrived and to our stay generally they generously took time to find out want we wanted to do where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see in amsterdam and explained how best to do it the canal view from our room was fabulous the location really perfect for seeing the city the bed was very comfortable and the shower great too the restaurant downstairs serves delicious food and along with the bar is bustling and funky
