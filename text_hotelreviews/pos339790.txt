this place is now among my top favorite hotels worldwide and i ve been to quite a few i had one night in amsterdam on a layover i found this place among the top on trip adviser so clicked to reserve on the short train ride from the airport to the city i loved the whole vibe and style of the place great location about min walk from the central train station or a euro uber ride they upgraded me to a beautiful spacious room overlooking the canal the design is pretty hip and modern but all spaces are warm and inviting with attention to lighting the price for a bottle of wine to go at the front desk was unheard of at and it was actually pretty decent
