the stay as a whole was absolutely amazing i wouldn t fault a single thing everything the room i stayed in was immaculate all the staff were so welcoming and helpful you re so central yet away from the manic hustle and bustle meaning you re able to walk everywhere with it being fairly close i would definitely stay in the hoxton amsterdam again
