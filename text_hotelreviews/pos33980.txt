the staff was so helpful and made my stay very comfortable i checked in late in the night on my arrival and the attendant was very courteous inviting and smiling he also gave me good tips for my stay the lady the next day was equally pleasant to deal with and proactive i was trying to find my key as i was making my way to the lift and before i even knew she was there handing me another cut i was impressed i would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel just a shame i didn t get to taste the breakfast they had some pancakes and pain d epices
