the interior of this hotel is beautiful throughout who ever designed the hotel has a keen eye for detail free breakfast bag delivered to your room every morning free wifi in the hotel and free international calls from your room the staff are really friendly and helpful the bar restaurant is always busy and seems to be really popular with the locals as well but you will need to make a reservation for the restaurant at the weekend if i return to amsterdam i will definitely stay in the hoxton hotel again
