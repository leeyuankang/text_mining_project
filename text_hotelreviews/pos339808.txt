the hotel is lovely and in an ideal location for sightseers our room was beautifully and thoughtfully decorated and the bed was very comfortable we were awoken after midnight one night by guests in the room above us making a lot of noise and the hotel management dealt with that problem very quickly and effectively all of the staff members we dealt with were helpful and professional
