the staff and the atmosphere that greeted you when you walked into the hotel or down from your room were the best bits the downside was that it was quite difficult to find somewhere to sit as a resident but you just had to look hard the location was absolutely perfect too within walking distance from centraal seconds from the treats of streets and a very quick cycle ride from all the sights brilliant
