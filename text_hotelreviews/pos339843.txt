loved the quirky and uber cool interior of the hox the bed was super comfy and had one of the best nights sleep snuggled up within it breakfast was a healthy bonus and the opportunity to spend a lazy sunday afternoon relaxing drinking and eating along with family in the sumptuous bar lounge area was most enjoyable
