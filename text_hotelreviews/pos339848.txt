the front desk staff were super helpful and friendly fantastic location the hoxton has a great vibe the rooms are comfortable with a great modern flare the breakfast bag with a banana yoghurt granola and orange juice was a great touch there is also a wine bottle opener in the room along with beautiful glassware complimentary bottled water and milk in the mini fridge upon arrival we would recommend the hoxton for sure and will return without a doubt
