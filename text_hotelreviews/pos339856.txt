the location of the hotel is excellent just a short walk away from dam sq and anne frank s house the hotel is lively relaxed with great service throughout and our cosy room was perfect overlooking the canal with tea coffee water and milk in the fridge full size toiletries and great hairdryer in the bathroom we also loved the breakfast in a bag hung outside our door every morning the herengracht canal area is lovely with some trendy shops and cafes
