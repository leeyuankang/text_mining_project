i really can t fault this hotel even a couple of really trivial things i asked to be done were sorted out perfectly and straight away the room was a good size double with everything you would need for a few days stay i was there for only two nights but would happily have stayed longer if could have and i wish i had booked this instead of the hotel opposite gare du nord where i spent my first night in paris i will definitely book this hotel in future if i can
