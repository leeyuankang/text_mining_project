incredible location on the nicest canal in amsterdam beautiful spacious unit just one important thing to know the rooms are in story old homes so be sure you check with the property if you have any physical limitations that would make it difficult to climb few or many steps breakfast is not included in the room rate but very good value lots of healthy choices fresh breads and omelets to order
