the rooms were beautifully appointed and clean and the flowers that were provided stayed fresh the entire week we were there the staff was extremely accommodating and helpful their restaurant recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed each meal we enjoyed having a drink or cappuccino in the library every evening and talking to each of the bartenders each one was so personable and attentive my friend had misplaced her sweater and by chance asked if anyone had turned it in to the front desk and the next morning the sweater was returned to her she thought she d lost it in on a visit to den haag i would highly recommend the ambassaade for a carefree destination in amsterdam
