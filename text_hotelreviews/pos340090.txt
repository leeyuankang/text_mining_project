i must say i ve stayed in several hotels of different styles and stars around the world and this is one of the best hoteles i ve ever stayed at not only the rooms must say that one thing i always notice is the quality of the bathroom towels nothing worst than getting dry with a rough towel in this case they felt like cotton location grab breakfast at spingel if you can great breakfast but above all the service is absolutely fantastic they go far and beyond any request from early checkin late checkout room service bike rentals etc oh plus they left us a box of chocolates in the room and they were outstanding absolutely recommended
