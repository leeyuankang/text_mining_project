the beds are very comfortable and the cover is a down comforter very cozy the cleaning staff takes excellent care of the hotel and the rooms it would help if the hotel staff explained or provided instructions on how to use the shower it is different from the ones used in america which is great but i had trouble figuring it out the location is perfect close enough to walk to many of the sites in the area anne frank house rijksmuseum nemo museum amsterdam centraal van gogh museum and many many wonderful cafes
