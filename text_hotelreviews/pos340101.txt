omg we love this hotel i think it s the best hotel we ve stayed during our weeks around europe this is a stars hotel but deserve the stars rating the room we ve got was amazingly unique an attic room top floor so unusual so cozy with a view of the canal itself i traveled w my mom sister and she has her own small room separate from our bed area the reception staff will help you to find a perfect tour packages for you and they are very helpful friendly too outside the hotel is a beautiful street a typical street in amsterdam very safe and it s not at a crowded dodgy area lots of quaint small restaurants shops tips use uber if you need to go anywhere if you don t want to walk love this hotel will definitely come back if we go to amsterdam again
