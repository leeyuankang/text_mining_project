location was excellent for our planned activities champs elysee tour eiffel louvre montmartre we could reach by foot it s central but quiet location so good sleep at nights we booked the hotel as late deal and got a really good discount i would not suggest to book it for a full price because then it s overpriced for sure although it s a star hotel the best think about it was location all the rest is totally ordinary but ok for me as i was not hoping for luxury
