the staff in the hotel were some of the nicest staff we have ever dealt with as a family of they made us feel very welcome and they accommodated our every request i emailed times prior to arrival and they answered all of my queries the hotel was clean stylish comfortable and close to all amenities the rooms are gorgeous the room service was delicious and affordable the breakfast was an array of buffet treats as well as personal hot food choices and the hotel brasserie served us fine french food and lovely wine and very reasonably priced too i cannot speak highly enough about this hotel and by far the staff made our experience fantastic one of the best hotels we have stayed in and we will return
