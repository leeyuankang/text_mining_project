the location of the hotel was great as it was easy to walk to many of the different sights and neighborhoods across amsterdam the area was architecturally beautiful and quiet i did like the canal view that we had the rainfall shower head heated floors and towel rack were pleasant treats the staff was very helpful and friendly i had a couple cappuccinos from the bar in library which was really unique and a great place to relax or mingle
