very happy i chose hotel ambassade for my trip to amsterdam very friendly welcome my room was below street level and it was perfect plenty of room massive bed which was very comfy nice modern feel to the bathroom which again was a good size room was cleaned spotlessly everyday two free bottles of water which was replaced each day overall excellent hotel and i will definitely return when i m back in amsterdam
