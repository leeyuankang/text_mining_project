the hotel was located on a beautiful canal it was a classic with a real tradition and beautiful lobby with books signed by authors if you re looking for a swanky hipster place this is not it but if you want to very special hotel with soul and a beautiful setting choose hotel ambassade also i have to say the staff was very professional i had read some reviews before coming and was half expecting not to like the place quite the contrary we loved it
