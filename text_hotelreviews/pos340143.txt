i loved this hotel the staff were helpful and kind the rooms were beautiful and clean and cozy the location is terrific you can walk everywhere but it is quiet and tranquil also right around the corner are great places to eat i thought that this was the best possible value for my money that i could have had it is one of the most enjoyable hotel stays i have ever had
