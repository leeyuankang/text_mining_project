beautiful rooms comfortable beds and most of all adjustable heating in the form of a normal radiator that can be turned up or down instead of the usual thermostat that never works superb breakfasts with proper buttery croissants fresh orange juice and real coffee the hotel has not been at all spoilt or lost any of its charm or cosiness by its extensive renovation just made even more comfortable the bar is a welcome addition as is the underfloor heating in the bathrooms the staff are lovely kind and helpful as always and the guest umbrellas are still there i would never stay anywhere else in amsterdam
