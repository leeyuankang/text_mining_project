the location of this hotel is perfect you can walk everywhere easily and is in a nice laid back neighbourhood the brasserie is well worth a visit the food is amazing and if you are lucky you can get a table looking out over the canal the brasserie staff were wonderful we also hit the bar where the barman makes cocktails to perfection
