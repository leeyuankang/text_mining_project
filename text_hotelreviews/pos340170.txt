had read that reception not very friendly however we found everyone there very helpful and friendly no matter what time for example we arrived after midnight due to a delayed flight and it was no problem we had a fabulous room bed extremely comfortable room was quiet as requested and staff always discreet ie no room cleaners banging along the hallways or in neighboring rooms i had noted that it was my husband s birthday when booking the room and we were greeted with lovely fresh flowers and chocolates in the room loved ending the evening in the library bar the bartender was willing to make us something even if we were there almost at closing the art everywhere in the hotel is just fabulous location unbeatable
