the rooms were very nice and in a very good condition the selection of granolas cereals and nuts at breakfast was very good however we would have appreciated a little more fresh fruit the staff was remarkably helpful and nice always in a good mood and eager to assist us we travelled with both young and older children and in comparison to other places we ve been to ambassade really is a place of its own
