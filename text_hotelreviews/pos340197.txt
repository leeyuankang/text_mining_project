we stayed in the ambassade for three nights the location is outstanding on one of the prettiest parts of the inner canals with a short walk to the museums shopping district or markets the quality of service was exceptional reception room and restaurant nothing was too much effort and all their recommendations were good the breakfast was extra not cheap but really great our room was clean comfortable and with a really nice bathroom i would fully recommend this hotel
