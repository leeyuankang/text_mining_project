this is a very nice hotel with extremely attentive and helpful staff very comfortable beds and extremely well located in the heart of amsterdam my room had a nice view of the canal which was very pleasant although i could hear traffic quite distinctively and suspect it might be a bit loud in the week ends if staying there over the week end i would ask for a room with a garden view instead i would definitely stay there again
