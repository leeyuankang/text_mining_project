excellent location able to walk everywhere the art on the walls was in extremely good taste and very interesting the decor was lovely and the high ceilings in our room added to the elegance of the room now having stayed in this hotel we wouldn t stay anywhere else in amsterdam the staff of course makes a difference and all of them were helpful
