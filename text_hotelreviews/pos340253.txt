i can t remember her name but the woman who checked us in was lovely so helpful and welcoming the hotel is beautifully decorated and well thought out the library bar was awesome our room overlooked the canal and was very comfortable i have stayed in amsterdam many times in many hotels but this was easily the best hotel experience i have had so far i will come back and recommend to friends i liked everything about it
