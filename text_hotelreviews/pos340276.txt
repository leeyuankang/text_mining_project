hotel was in a perfect location we loved the room decor and ambience of hotel it is physically unique hotel layout off of a canal we had a room overlooking the canal staff was very helpful and accommodating we would definitely stay here again we did not eat in the hotel restaurant though it looked very nice we wanted a bit more casual setting
