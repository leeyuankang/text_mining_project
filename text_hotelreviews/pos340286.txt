we stayed at the hotel at the end of october and had a family room as we had our year old daughter with us the hotel is in an excellent location on the heren gracht canal and is ideally placed for walking to all the attractions and has an abundance of local smart bars and cafes the hotel staff were very warm and welcoming from the minute we arrived we stayed in room which was on the floor and had stunning views over the canal the room was a good size but obviously made smaller by the fact we had another bed in the room however it was well decorated and had a superb modern bathroom the room had a mini bar but sadly no coffee or tea making facilities in the room although the hotel does have hour room service the free wi fi had excellent speed we can t recommend this hotel enough and would gladly stay again
