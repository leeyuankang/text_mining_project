the location is great nice and quiet but still within walking distance to main sites the room i had was so beautiful it was pink too and being a girl it made me feel special have a great view of the canal i would recommend this location and hotel to anyone jordaan is best area to stay in away from the crazy centre but close enough to train station to walk
