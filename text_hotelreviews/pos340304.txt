the staff was extremely helpful and i was able to get museum tickets through them as well as directions and any other information i needed i only had the breakfast one day but it was delicious the room was clean and comfortable and even though i didn t have a canal view it was still very nice the location was perfect and i was able to walk everywhere i went it was also very easy to find my way back no matter where i ended up i thoroughly enjoyed my stay there
