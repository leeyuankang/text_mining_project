i can honestly not say anything negative about our stay perhaps that it was just way too short stairs outside the front door appeared daunting but the ladies from the hotel immediately saw us and came to help with our heavy luggage lovely room with tea and coffee making facilities a small minibar with free water soft drinks and beer and a tray with decanters filled with cognac gin and whisky free the room had a tiny balcony and overlooked the gracht extremely central location the beds were excellent and the breakfast absolutely delicious with eggs to order tea and coffee with cake was available in the foyer area when we arrived nuts sweets and crisps and between and pm there is the most wonderful cheese and wine etc for free lots of alcohol that people could just help themselves too water and soft drinks excellent bread and lots of different snacks with the cheese and wine lots of people enjoyed this and it was fun meeting other people there we arrived very early so our luggage was safely locked away until we returned and were able to get to our room we had reservations for many attactions so time was of the essence we walked to the anne frank museum and later also to the rijksmuseum and van goch museum we are very glad we ended our day in amsterdam with a canal cruise and dinner as that showed us to much more of amsterdam that we would not have had the time to do another plus point is that the public transport trams run just in the street outside the hotel staff members were very friendly and helpful i would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there if in amsterdam ever again i plan to add photos once i ve had time to download them
