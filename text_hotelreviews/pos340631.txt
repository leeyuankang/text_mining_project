one of the best hotels i ve been so far their approach of all inclusive and their logo a home away from home live up to the expectations loved the art deco building walking distance to restaurants shopping strips and about minutes from the museum square staff was very nice approachable and professional i loved the afternoon free drinks for all coffee and nibbles breakfast was varied with freshly cooked eggs and pancakes i will certainly return
