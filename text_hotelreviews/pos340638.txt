a great experience the room service was fantastic and the bed and pillows were so comfortable the hotel offers complimentary drinks and snacks every afternoon and the full breakfast is included in the price the staff went out of their way to assist us in planning our outings every day only one small glitch the television had a mind of it s own the staff did send a repairman the next morning this is a charming older hotel with character and personality not your run of the mill chain hotel with hundreds of rooms we would definitely return again we were in room it had a great canal view and street view as it was a corner room so be sure to ask for or or for a lovely large comfortable room
