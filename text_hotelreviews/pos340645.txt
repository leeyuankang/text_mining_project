the staff were exceptional very friendly and helpful british airways lost our main suitcase which carried critical medicine and all our clothing we tried and tried to communicate with the airline but could only get robots the concierge was wonderful in helping to locate our case even after the wrong one was delivered the free mini bar and free drinks snacks and cheeses in the lounge where we could mingle with other guests is a fabulous bonus at banks mansion our room was very comfortable and clean and they served a great breakfast one of our best stays during travelling ever
