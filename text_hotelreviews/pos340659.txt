the hotel was perfect from the time we checked in until our departure we requested an early check in and we were extremely pleased that we were able to check in when we arrived around am the room was very comfortable not big but not too small all of the staff were very friendly and helpful providing valuable information about things to do and places to eat the breakfast was great with many options you could get eggs made to order including omelets and they also had made to order pancakes fresh squeezed orange juice plenty selection of bread cheese and meats yogurt fruit or cereal having the ability to get drinks and snakes whenever you wanted was great the evening wine and cheese event was a fantastic way to relax and enjoy the cozy living lounge and fire the hotel arranged for a private shuttle to the airport that cost less than our taxi ride we took to the hotel
