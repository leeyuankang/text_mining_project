we thoroughly enjoyed our stay from arrival to departure the staff were absolutely fabulous everyone was extremely friendly and helpful ranging from the staff at the reception area the people cleaning the rooms and the really happy breakfast team although our room was small it was really cosy and had everything we needed a view of the canal a comfy bed and a shower room that provided us with lots of boiling hot water whenever we needed it the open bar and cheese selection during the late afternoon period was always a welcome delight to return to if planning another trip to amsterdam we would without hesitation book this hotel again its proximity to the galleries the shopping areas and excellent restaurants was a huge bonus and we were able to walk everywhere
