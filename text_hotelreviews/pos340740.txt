we had an amazing time at the banks mansion hotel the staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful they gave us restaurant recommendations and talked us through a map of the city advising us on where we should visit the bedroom was lovely with the most comfortable bed and pillows the breakfast was delicious such a great selection to choose from it really did feel like you were at home when you got in the door and could help yourself to a drink and snacks in the lobby it was a lovely treat and i would highly recommend this hotel i can t wait to go back
