the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful breakfast was highly entertaining thanks to the jovial chef the lounge bar was fabulous the kids loved the games on the lounge ipads it was great to come back any time of the day to a free access bar and snacks we really spent no time in the room despite no restaurant the room service for the kids provided great food from local restaurants at reasonable prices so many restaurants are so close to the hotel we didn t need and in hotel option we checked out early am staff brought croissants to the lounge for us before we left the rooms and bathrooms were very clean beds very comfortable the hotel is locked at night with someone on staff to let you in so great security if you re staying alone it s a very small hotel do very much a hone away from home atmosphere
