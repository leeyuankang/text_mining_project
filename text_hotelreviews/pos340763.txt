staff were very friendly and always willing to help beds were super comfortable and the double room we booked was a very good size location is perfect set on the side of of a lovely canal close to everything nearby but still chilled and peaceful the all inclusive thing is all well and good but it s hard to spend much time in the hotel when you re in amsterdam so never really made the most of it although it s nice to be able to arrive back to the hotel and have a few nightcap drinks for free rather than pay each great hotel would love to go back
