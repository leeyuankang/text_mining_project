a wonderful hotel in a fantastic central canal side position the staff from reception to housekeeping to bar and catering were quite honestly superb nothing was too much trouble and they did everything to make our stay a memorable one despite all this the hotel was remarkably relaxed and without the stuffiness you can get with some hotels of this standard and quality it s not cheap but in the case of the amsterdam waldorf astoria you definitely do get what you pay for
