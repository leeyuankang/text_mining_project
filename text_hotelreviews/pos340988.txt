we have every mix feelings about this hotel as we just arrived for one night the cleaner was interrupting as times trying to clean our room as we arrived maybe hours before times she knock to the door and next time she entered our room without checking if we are in she also knock the room at before we were leaving for breakfast finally before we left the hotel and i was paying the bill i notice that the new note received last day in the shop disappear from my wallet i address the problem to the supervisor but we have not received any respond as we travelling a lot so far this one is biggest disappointment from this class of hotels
