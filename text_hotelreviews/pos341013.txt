i loved every single thing about my stay here having previously stayed in different waldorf astoria s around the world including new york i genuinely feel this is by far my favourite my room was absolutely divine staying in the deluxe room right on the river with my partner i was only sheduled to stay here for nights but i fell so in love with the room city and staff that i extended my stay an extra nights absolutely obsessed with the shower in my room so perfect and actually heart broken that i have to leave it room is sooo spacious bed is amazing giving you a perfect sleep and they even have their own pillow menu for that extra comfort as if you need it staff i cannot applaud them enough genuinely care and go the extra mile for you i would like to make special compliments to the reception concierge lizanne not sure on the spelling exceptional customer service skills and really really cared about mine and my partners upmost comfort during our stay and ran all over the building at all hours of the night for us one last thing the building and the architecture of this building is incredible an amazing historic building with a beautiful characteristic luxury interior design cannot reccomend this hotel enough
