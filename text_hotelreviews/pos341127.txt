the hotel is in a good location with the tram to the city centre just outside it is a minute tram ride the rooms are just what you need as you don t spend time in them except for sleeping and they are quiet having a kettle in the room would have been a plus but not to be you can buy breakfast at the hotel but there are eating places nearby we chose the latter option and had breakfast at the bakery across the road there is also a small bar in the foyer for drinks after a busy day of sightseeing staff were very helpful with directions where to buy transport pass etc there were tour buses using this hotel but you didn t notice the extra people only when the busload arrived for check in would recommend
