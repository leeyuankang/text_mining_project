very good low cost hotel not really central location but very close to the tram and the public transport tram u bahn just works at a reasonalble price you could however easily walk the distance as well if you go to vienna the primary purpose of the hotel is to have a place to stay because you are gonna spend the whoile day exploring the city and this hotel fits the purpose perfectly
