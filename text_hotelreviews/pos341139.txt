we stayed a single night only but would anytime return for a longer stay everything went smoothly personal was polite room equipment very nice i especially appreciated the possiblity of checking in anytime the entire day and night and the check out till the neighbourhood might raise slight doubts on the actual quality of the accomodation but there is definitely no reason for that
