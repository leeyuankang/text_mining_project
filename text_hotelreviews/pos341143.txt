i liked airy commodious room and freindly staff lovely bar in the lobby and the price is very favorable but i think the price for breakfast is too high euros but you can choose not to have it it is near stadthalle and i chose it because i went to a show there i liked that taxi came in two minutes after the lady called it from reception desk
