hotel jager was a fab find located on a busy street it is a small and quiet idyll with a nice green garden where we had our breakfasts and held work meetings ppl all staff are very friendly responsive and helpful it was very hot in vienna on the days of our stay so we had some nice fresh water with mint and lemon offered in the hallway as a complement very appreciated the rooms were comfortable light and very clean the single bed was quite big actually a very welcome surprise our team of three which stayed in the hotel for a business meeting really enjoyed our stay and recommends it to others
