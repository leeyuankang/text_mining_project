we had an odd arrival situation which was accommodated very graciously the breakfast buffet is awesome foamed milk for the coffee homemade jams plus a table of savories including smoked salmon the front desk had tram tickets available it takes about minutes to get into the city center the front desk also provided excellent local restaurant recommendations
