we arrived earlier than the check in time but were given a room at once which was a help the room was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed the breakfast was excellent with everything you could want everything regularly replenished so no hanging around for foods that had run out and the cakes bread and pastries were very fresh excellent scrambled eggs the waiting staff were helpful and attentive we found all the hotel staff restaurant bar and reception to be very friendly and helpful a special mention to andreas on reception who was utterly charming friendly and efficient the hotel had a very pleasant atmosphere which was down to the staff and probably because the guests didn t have anything to complain about
