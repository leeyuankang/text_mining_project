as vienna touristic center is small the hotel is in the dead center with a u bahn station seconds away to get to the farther attractions or the city airport train was one of the most comfortable beds we slept on and the room was super clean we also received complementary use of the mini bar which was refreshing after a longs day walk the staff was always willing to help and took their time to assist and answer all the questions all in all the stay was one of our best i would have gladly stayed a few more nights
