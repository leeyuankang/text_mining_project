staff were unfailingly knowledgeable helpful professional and just cheery wonderful location just steps from the underground metro and in easy walking distance to main sights this hotel has a good mix of business and leisure travelers and they are thus fully equipped to handle the needs of both smart comfortable appointments in the room with a number of little touches that made us feel appreciated and welcome including fresh bottled water and chocolates each day
