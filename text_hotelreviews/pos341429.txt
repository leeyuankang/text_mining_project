mainstream star hotel perfectly situated in the very heart of vienna a few minutes walk from the hofburg palace the graben shopping street and st stephen s cathedral it is in an old good looking building but at some point in the past or so years was the subject of an aesthetically questionable refurbishment it is however truly impeccably clean and maintained to an as new level that is not easy to come by in lesser hotels the deluxe room was of fair size also impeccably cleaned and maintained and fairly well equipped for a business class hotel we paid a little extra for a corner room with more windows and i felt like it was also a little bigger than other rooms on our floor it was one of the very few to have a balcony which was a nice touch no space to sit but pleasangt to walk out in the morning the minibar was adequate water coke and beer and free throughout the stay nespresso is provided but oddly not a kettle we did not try the breakfast but did use the spa gym sauna steam bath and relaxation area which is nice and very clean if often a little crowded
