a great location with friendly and helpful staff who seemed to really care that we enjoyed our visit we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room which was a pleasant surprise and enjoyed both the restaurant and bar it is a more expensive hotel than we usually stay in but worth paying the extra for the comfort and service this trip was a special birthday celebration for me and made all the better for a great hotel
