after staying in two remarkable boutique hotels the steigenberger hotel herrenhof was our only traditional hotel on a recent visit to germany and austria we were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade the staff was good but defiantly very busy the breakfast included in our booking was nicely done the hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to many of vienna s highlights
