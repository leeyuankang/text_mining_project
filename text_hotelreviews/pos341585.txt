i am a frequent overseas traveler and this was by far my best hotel experience in all of my years of european stays i had to quickly pull together a suite based meeting but did not want to do an overload on beverages and food and everyone from the front desk to the folks in the bar helped get items quickly to the room to the wait staff were simply outstanding
