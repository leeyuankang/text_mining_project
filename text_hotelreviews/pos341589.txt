location is excellent in the center of the old town about minutes from the old palace and st michaels church meters from the historic cafe central which serves good food at reasonable price breakfast at the hotel has excellent variety and quality if your room rate does not include the breakfast i suggest that you reserve for breakfast when check in to get the discount euro per person without reservation vs euro per person without reservation i didn t book the breakfast but we ended up having breakfast there for three days just because it was so good and so convenient
