the hotel is very well located one street from the station is just off the main street that runs from the station to the sea you can easily walk from the hotel to the promenade or catch the tram the staff was very helpful one staff member got us a good taxi rate as we had to leave for the airport before there was also a very nice coffee machine in the room the beds are very comfortable
