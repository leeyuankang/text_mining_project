very friendly staff great location as it was close to loads of shops and round the corner from hard rock cafe and plenty of metro stations nearby which made travelling around much easier the bed was incredibly comfortable and showers are amazing i would highly recommend this hotel as it s got all the essentials and is incredibly clean and well maintained
