we opted for one of the suites and the room was fabulous and very spacious beds were extremely comfortable and facilities were good i am unaware if there is a spa area or not as we didn t ask breakfast was the usual you would expect from a european hotel perfectly adequate all staff we found to be very pleasant and helpful even booking the city bus trip for us as a special treat head over the road to cafe central for an amazing dessert
