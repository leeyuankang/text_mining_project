the hotel has been transfrormed since we stayed there about years ago it is beautifully appointed the room we stayed in was very large the toilet was separate from the bathroom a distinct advantage the staff were polite and helpful although the hotel is not centrally located it is very easy to travel to the centre by the nearby underground train service in just a few minutes the entrance to the grounds of schonbrunn palace is diametrically facing the hotel i would not stay anywhere else if i were to visit vienna again
