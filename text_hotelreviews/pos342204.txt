this is a great hotel at a fair fee if you want to stay away from or don t need to be in the busy vienna city centre yet it is only a couple of kilometers from the centre of vienna which is not a large city by any standard the hotel is virtually next door to the schoenbrunn palace but if you need night entertainment well i only strayed for one night and the biergarten nearby served me perfectly
