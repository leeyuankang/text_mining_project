i really like almost everything in this hotel the staffs were great the room was spacious and comfortable have mini balcony really close to the train station and schonbrunn palace the hotel has nice neighbourhood and views the wifi connection was so so in the room but so fast in the lobby so i can just casually rest at the lobby and use the wifi not to mention the austrian people that we ve met there are really nice and helpful such a great experience we have there
