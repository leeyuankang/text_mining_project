we loved this hotel an excellent location very close to the railway station which was only a minute walk away very handy for reaching the centre of the city in approx minutes the surrounding area is very nice with some good restaurants and shops we particularly liked the japanese restaurant which is just along the street from the hotel the hotel s restaurant serves beautiful food and we enjoyed a very relaxing evening there the hotel bar is also very good a super place to unwind and relax with very attentive staff and good music our room was beautiful spotlessly clean and the bed was superb everything about the bathroom was great and there was constant hot water the reception staff were all very helpful and friendly we would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly return excellent value for money
