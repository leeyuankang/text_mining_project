we got an upgrade so were particularly pleased with the room how big and how warm it was we went for the rainbow ball held at the same hotel and were impressed about how quiet it was in the room despite such a big event taking place just there all very convenient for us also just in front of the park leading to the palace so great to have that to visit the following day
