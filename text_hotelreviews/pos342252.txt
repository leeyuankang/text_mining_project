location our target was schoenbrunn so from this point of view the choice of this hotel was just great as schoenbrunn is located around the corner verbatim it is also very easy to go to the center of vienna as the metro station is located very close to the hotel the area called hitzing around the hotel ias also very nice to walk and very green i suppose in spring and summer as we stayed in january we had the spacious room big enough for the family breakfast was good good choice of dishes the hotel is located in the beatuful historical building
