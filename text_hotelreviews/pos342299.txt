hotel is located in very pleasant suburb but with quick and easy access to city centre schonbrunn has some sights as well hotel located close to and trams room had its own outdoor seating area overlooking courtyard which was very pleasant we had problems with the first room but the second was ok impressions were that the rooms were fairly standard hotel rooms but nothing too remarkable rooms were very quiet good fast wi fi hotel ballroom was a good entertainment space and catering was good some of the portering staff went out of their way to help find us an ironing board due to lack of pressing service over weekends
