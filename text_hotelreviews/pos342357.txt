the hotel itself our room executive room and its history were incredible it was probably one of the nicest rooms i ve stayed in very large clean and quiet rooms except for the church bell across the street which gave a nice atmosphere it is across the street and a ten minute walk through the gardens from sch nbrunn palace while it s very convenient for that it s about minutes on the u bahn from the city center i would go back to this hotel
