the hotel itself is super charming i love the hardwood floors chandeliers and high ceilings it felt like staying at the schloss schonbrunn itself i also really enjoyed the little details the free drink vouchers access to the minibar we received free softdrinks and robes slippers these small touches made the hotel stand out
