the bed was so comfy and the decor in our room was very stylish the hotel bar was cheap so good for pre drinks and we were pointed in the direction of a lovely traditional austrian restaurant top of the road then round the corner also minutes walk to the underground so not long from centre of vienna at all we didn t bother with breakfast because at euro a head we could get it cheaper elsewhere but overall this hotel was great value for money
