helpful staff really quiet and relaxing location perfect for a walk in the evening there were plenty of free parking spots if you didn t want to pay for the garage it is close to the bus stop and to some supermarkets the apartment was spacious and also had a large balcony terrace a big plus were the extra comfy beds with fluffy pillows and soft mattresses
