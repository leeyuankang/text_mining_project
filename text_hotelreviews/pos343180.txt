i liked the room very much it had a good design a great view with beautiful windows using agreeable materials i liked the temperature controls which were easy to operate and effective i loved the location it gave us so much flexibility for getting around walking around the canals and visiting the rijksmusuem the staff were also very friendly and of a very high quality
