we were delighted with hotel le marcel the street entrance does not look like much but when you get up to the first floor reception and into the rooms it is very attractively and thoughtfully designed in modern style to maximize the space the room was small but attractive and had everything needed and the bed was good very nice bathroom the breakfast buffet was terrific and we liked it that they had the ny times international edition to read with breakfast location is great across from the gare de l est but we did not hear street noise when we closed the window
