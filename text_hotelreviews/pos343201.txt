the staff were welcoming on arrival and the lounge area was comfortable and there were stands with information about the various attractions in the city the room was huge and one side of it was a wall of windows looking out to the top of the rijksmuseum straight ahead and down on the garden with glass pyramids which were lit up at night we would recommend the higher floors for the best views we were on the the room was spacious and the bed large and very comfortable the bathroom had a full sized bath with a shower attached the tv was large and there was the usual tea coffee making facilities as well as a small fridge mini bar there was plenty of space in the wardrobes cupboards and there was an iron and ironing board not that we used it but it was a thoughtful addition to the facilities there was a fitness suite downstairs and ice making facilities down the corridor the reception staff were cheerful friendly and very helpful even going online to book our return seats on the plane for us the day before we left fortunately their english was very good as neither of us spoke any dutch we found a number of restaurants locally over the other side of the canal and the rijksmuseum and van gogh museum were both within a very short walk from the hotel in the other direction there were busses and trams not far away and apparently the bus usually stops even closer but there are some works going on to build a carpark under the canal so the bus stops a bit further away at the moment the works didn t disturb us at all we would definitely return to the nh museum quarter again
