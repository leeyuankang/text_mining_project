great hotel newly renovated large room big bed big bathroom as with a lot of hotels in paris there is not a lobby on the ground floor there is security and a small entrance and the entrance can be hard to find the room is air conditioned and worked well it is walking distance from the gare d nord train station and the underground train station gare d lest is just over the road also many taxis in front of the station for your trip to the airport expect to pay about to euros if they are honest
