the hotel is conveniently positioned just outside of city centre but still close to any attractions and just next door to a large shopping mall the facilities are little bit old but they are kept in perfect shape the bed was really comfortable and breakfast had a good variety of choice and healthy options though it might get a little monotonous after few days it is a good compromise between location value and good transport connection the underground station is just m from the property and there is a bus stop just opposite of hotel entrance which will take you to notting hill hyde park or hammersmith directly the rooms are solidly equipped though one fights for a space a little the choice of tv programs is english only but with a good variety
