friendly staff great location and close to tourist attractions checking in was so easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful parking is secure but be careful as it is a steep slope going into and out of the car park and tight turns but apart from that it was excellent to know your car is safe and secure and reasonably priced will definitely be using this hotel again
