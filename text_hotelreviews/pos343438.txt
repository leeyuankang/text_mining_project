arriving after a long haul flight from australia i found the check in staff most helpful i chose to stay at this hotel because my friend and i were joining a trafalgar tour which left from there we found it easy to get around london public transport was very close the hotel itself was very clean and welcoming after a long day tripping around london it was really nice to sit in the bar downstairs before dinner and enjoy the ambiance
