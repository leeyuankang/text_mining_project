the meal we had was very nice for hotel food prices were a bit high but it was well prepared the beds were very comfortable great pillows love the shampoo etc location near the mall provided a wide variety of restaurants and there were even more down the road in the opposite direction very close to the tube station the a c worked extremely well and the room was quite comfortable
