breakfast was very good good variety of options and staff in there were very attentive bed could have been comfier staff very polite and helpful rooms could do with updating a bit bit dated location of hotel was great close to westfields and within walking distance on the olympia exhibition centre which was why we were staying the weekend car park far too pricey so parked in westfields and walked over a lot cheaper
