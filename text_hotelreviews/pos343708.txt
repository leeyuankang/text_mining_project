location was a key factor as we stayed due to going to the theatre on the saturday also liked the closeness to westfield which i didn t realise until there a great concierge service at the hotel that let me leave my case at the hotel as i arrived really early due to the theatre and room wasn t ready not that i was expecting it to be and then the next morning let me leave my case there while i went shopping i didn t use any of the hotel facilities apart from concierge or any of the food outlets
