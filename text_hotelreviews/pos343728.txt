location is excellent quick access to underground nearby shopping and eating clean quiet neighbourhood minute walk to kensington gardens staff was helpful and full of information rooms cleaned and well put out every day juice and pastries in the morning were a fantastic extra price was more than decent for london recommend this to anyone visiting london
