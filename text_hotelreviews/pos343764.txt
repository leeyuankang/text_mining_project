the location was very convenient i wanted to stay walking distance to portobello rd but away from crowds as at nottinghill gate to arrive from gatwick is quick and much less expensive than using the gatwick express you go diretly thryu southern lines change at clapham junction and go strait to sheperd s bush where the hilton is the other side of the road breakfast is good and service is also good despite hilton being a huge hotel where personal attendance is almost impossible
