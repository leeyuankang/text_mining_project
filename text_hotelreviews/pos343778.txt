i loved staying at this hotel beautiful comfortable amazing breakfast and super friendly staff asked for a quiet room and got just that it was completely quiet at night which was perfect great location by the shepherds bush underground and overground station near westfield shopping center where there are many lovely restaurants loved our stay at hilton kensington
