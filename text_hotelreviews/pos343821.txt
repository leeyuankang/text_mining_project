beds were really comfortable good variety of fresh food at breakfast and liked having bottled water position of hotel great for public transport links bus stops picks up right outside the hotel takes you to all the main attractions tip buy your all day travel card day before so you can hop straight on the bus in the morning when you start your day of sightseeing
