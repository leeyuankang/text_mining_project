hilton generally has good sized rooms compared to most london hotels and large very comfortable beds room service options were tasty albeit a bit limited especially for breakfast staff were very friendly and personable and the location was excellent for me as i was staying there for notting hill carnival i liked that tea coffee are available in the room and the minibar is now available for use by guests as a mini fridge i wish i knew that ahead of time as i intended to walk with some meal items and thought i wouldn t have had access to a fridge though the bathroom was small there was a decent amount of counter space to place my toiletries etc something you don t often get i liked the blackout curtains as well as that allowed me to sleep in a bit it was easy to travel from this location as it s between two main tube stations and there were ample black cabs available out front i used uber a lot as well and it was always easy for them to find the hotel
