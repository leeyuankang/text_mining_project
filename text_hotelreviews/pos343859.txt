well upon arrival was greeted and felt really welcome looked lovely inside and seemed tho we would have a lovely weekend paid the fee upfront aswel as a deposit incase i wanted to use any other facilities had a lovely weekend however upon arrival asked to pay again but told i would only be charged the first time i paid and the second was just as a security measure days later arriving home i have now been put overdrawn in my bank after being charged the full amount deposit amount can you get your breath twice when i phoned the hilton to confront them was shouted at down the phone spoken to innapropriatly and then cut off the phone to which i obviously phoned back and they did not answer my call twice i then used a different phone and would you believe it they answered when i spoke cut me off again finally got through and was just repeatedly shouted at and spoken to like what i can only describe as a piece of muck on someone s shoe and that was lying when i had proof absolutely disgusting how do they suppose everybody has enough money to be charged twice and put into their overdraft and then called a liar when confronted i have since phoned my bank who refunded me one amount of money which will take days to clear so i am now skint until days time such a shame because the stay and hotel was lovely shame about the money situation and more importantly the attitude of the customer service staff at the hilton kensington
