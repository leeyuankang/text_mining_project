a pleasant hotel almost half way between shepherds bush and holland park tube stations everything in london is only a short ride away which makes a good trade off against location and price breakfast is an all you can eat buffet with veggie and continental options we didn t eat in the restaurant choosing instead the local food places within walking distance towards holland park tube stop
