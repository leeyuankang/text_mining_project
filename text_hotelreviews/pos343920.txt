we hated everything about the hotel your breakfast staff member on sat morning was the only best staff you had on your team your night porter was a nice man but it wasnt fair that he was working on the night on his own hence delays on us getting basic essentials your consiair staff was kind but overall your management team didnt run that hotel well that weekend it was one of my worst stays ever at the hilton we liked nothing
