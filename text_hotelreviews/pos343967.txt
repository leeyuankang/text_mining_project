the staff were the friendliest i have ever come across nothing was too much trouble for them always smiling the nearby shopping centre was very useful and gave a wide choice of restaurants which meant that you could have lots of different dining experiences within a few minutes walk and access to the tube and overground trains was really easy making travel throughout london very simple
