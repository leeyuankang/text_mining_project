the bathroom was cleaned every single day and well decent linen room a bit small perhaps but there was a storage area where our suitcases could be kept the only fly in the ointment was an attendant in the exexcutive dining room who was consistently rude to me not to all guests and that our safe seemed to be tampered with when an error message came up and we could not open it we had used it successfully up to then the on duty engineer had to sort it out later on when we checked out we discovered that an envelope with was missing we did not report it as we did not think that there was anything which could be done at that point but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and the big favor they did by having my hat delivered to me which i had forgotten in my haste to leave for our son s wedding on saturday may
