on my second stay in the last two years my husband and i celebrate our anniversary here we love the trendy chic style and luxury feel of this small hotel that still has it s old world features like original staircase and winding hallways its location is ideal for a minute stroll to notre dame or lover s walk along the river the room is well appointed with usb ports electronic door locks small stocked refrigerator lots of closet space large bathroom with plush towels very comfortable bed great pillows and fine linens no view from this particular room but blackout curtains made for a great late wake up
