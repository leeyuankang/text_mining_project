this is the second year we have stayed here to do the london marathon the staff are great and can t do enough and the room was brilliant and very quiet and clean with a large tv and very comfortable queen size bed it s located minutes away from the subway and a large shopping centre we were allowed to come back and use the gym for a shower after the marathon despite having checked out which was a nice touch we will definitely return
