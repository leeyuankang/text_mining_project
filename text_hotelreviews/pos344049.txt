the staff was amazing whenever we had a request or a need for assistance the staff member would stop whatever he or she was doing and solve the problem no matter how long it took even if it was outside their job description the young lady in charge of the executive lounge was particularly helpful the breakfast was delicious also our stay was very pleasant
