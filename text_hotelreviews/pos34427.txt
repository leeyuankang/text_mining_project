everything was absolutely perfect the location is unbelievable everything is walking distance including min walk to metro staff was so helpful and kind they gave us the room early and let us do a late checkout for free even though they were fully booked they also changed our original room witch was close to the elevators and a bit too noisy for us to a bigger and quieter room again for free loved our stay here very much
