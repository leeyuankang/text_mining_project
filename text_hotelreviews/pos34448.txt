the location of hotel duo is perfect i arrived by train and metro and it was very easy even with lots of luggage for a first timer in paris the staff were overly helpful one of the reception staff i feel terrible forgetting his name is a complete foodie and had the best advice on where to eat for each specific dish you might like to taste in paris from local knowledge of the area to assisting with airlines the staff were outstanding
