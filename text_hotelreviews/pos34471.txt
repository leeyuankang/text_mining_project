what s not to like i had a single room which had a double bed but it was so well designed that even though the size was small i barely noticed i loved having an in room safe and the bed was really comfortable the shower was small but the bathroom was a great size overall the staff were really helpful friendly and efficient the hotel is really easy to find being right behind the hotel de ville and close to the hotel de ville metro and a short walk to the rer for cdg connections at chatelet les halles i could walk to most things and exploring the marais was fun there s a strip of patisseries just around the corner that i highly recommend i actually left a bag with the hotel for a few days before my check in and i greatly appreciated them doing that i d love to stay at hotel duo again
