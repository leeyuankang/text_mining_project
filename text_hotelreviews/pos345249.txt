the hotel is very conveniently located it took us mins to get to the centre of the old town and st stephen s church staff at the des was very helpful upon arrival we were offered a free of charge old city tour with eng guide to be held the next day morning which was absolutely great and make our day in vienna a great experience the building is quite old obviously it is located in historic part of the city and you can tell it by design of the rooms bathroom etc but everything is clean and neat and the service very good in the bathroom i prefer a shower cabin rather than a bath with a glass screen that we received but it was ok overall worth recommending and certainly a very good choice when travelling to or through vienna with day visiting capacity the service is very good and the location gives an advantage of getting to top vienna spots by foot in to mins both to the old town as well as to prater
