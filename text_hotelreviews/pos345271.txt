i really enjoyed the stay in this hotel the price was a little bit expensive comparing with the sizes of the room and facilities but the hotel is very conveniently located staff is very friendly breakfasts were good enough there was a kettle in the room the room was very clean it was not noisy in the room i mean that i was not disturbed by the noise from the other rooms it was cozy inside the bed was very comfortable i had a good rest there wi fi also was available
