the breakfast was wonderful and so were the staff they were very friendly and engaging with my yr old son they even had a little play area in outside the restaurant for the kids to play with the rooms were very clean and comfortable it was close the the train station about a min walk there is a small convenience store by the station if you need snacks it was a bit outside of town but for the price it was perfect
