amazing the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was really nice we were on our honeymoon and they gave us a card to congratulate us and a nice little tray with macaroons etc right across the road from a train station so easy to get to central and lots of shops around the arena would definitly stay here again if we come back to amsterdam
