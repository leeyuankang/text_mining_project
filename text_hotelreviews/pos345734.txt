chose this hotel as near to ziggo dome where i came from the uk for one day and night purely to attend a pop concert was easy to get to hotel from airport via metro and easy to walk to and back from at night very safe and convenient had trouble finding the hotel initially but on asking anyone could help with directions staff were very helpful and friendly
