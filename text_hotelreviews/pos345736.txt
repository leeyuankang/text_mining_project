the staff were so brilliant at the hotel particularly the manager christel every question and room adjustment we asked for was met with friendly smiley people who were always happy to help we got extra duvets tea and coffee in the room there was always fresh lemon water at reception just overall welcoming and comfortable location was great less than minutes from centraal station by metro last metro back is about midnight and it costs for a day pass to go all around the city by tram bus and metro lots of food options near the hotel as well as their own lovely cafe restaurant which has great internet access and places to sit and plug in your phone or laptop wifi in the room was pretty poor only complaint from me but could always connect in other parts of the hotel i would definitely recommend if you want comfort away from the craziness of the centre of amsterdam but want easy and quick access to the centre
