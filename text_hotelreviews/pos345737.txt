i was worried about the location as the hotel is not in amsterdam city centre however travelling by train is very easy to and from the hotel the day pass was excellent and meant that we could use the trams in the city centre too the hotel was extremely comfortable with very friendly and helpful staff even when we arrived at nine o clock on our first night the restaurant prepared a lovely meal for us
