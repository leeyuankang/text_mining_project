room and en suit were spotlessly clean and spacious bar was lovely and open till excellent for a quick nightcap good value for money and a short walk to the metro train to central was a quick ride and we never had to wait long for one to arrive in either direction euro s each for unlimited hour travel was very reasonable would happily stay again and definitely recommend
