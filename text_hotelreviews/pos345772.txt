the rooms were very clean and the location excellent it is close enough to the airport and the center of amsterdam we only had a a short time in amsterdam and the location allowed some time to sleep and see the city i would recommend taking the train the hotel is super close to the train station just ask around at the airport about what train to take the hotel staff is very helpful in telling you which train to take to get the city center would stay here again for sure
