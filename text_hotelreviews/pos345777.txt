the hotel is new and very clean the staff was very helpful and kind it is not close to the city center but the metro station is just minutes far away and it connects directly to the most important attractions also the connection to schiphol airport is very good as the bus station is very close and bus no connects directly to there breakfast is very good and has a lot of choices
