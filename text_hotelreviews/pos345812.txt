we stayed in this hotel for the first time nights there were almost no guests during the first days of our stay which meant that the very good breakfast buffet was not completely on display but you only needed to ask very friendly personnel clean room best bed i ever slept in ample and easily accessible parking space we also ate in the restaurant no complaints there hand cut fries but a little bit too expensive minute walk to metro and from there direct tram to city center shops cinema restaurants within walking distance
