the onsite restaurant was very convenient and provided good value for meals when you just don t feel like going out anymore there weren t very many other choices in the vicinity so the option of having a good meal in a clean and contemporary setting was nice to have each table had an outlet so can plug in with usb outlets as well charge your phones and stay connected free wifi was great the bijlmer arena train station which is one of the major hubs in amsterdam is an easy min walk from the hotel and an esprit outlet was right outside the station
