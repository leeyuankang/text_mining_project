everything was great yes this hotel is not directly in the touristic city center but it s only about minutes away from centraal station via tram also the tram stop is about minutes away from hotel by walking since hotel rooms are on the upper floors of the building the view is amazing and neighborhood is very quiet at nights so hotel has a very good value comparing with prices
