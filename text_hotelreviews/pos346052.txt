very convenient location to cruise terminal especially if you would prefer to be out of the congestion and noise of downtown amsterdam only minutes by tram to central station an unusual hotel as the top floors of a mixed use building but views were fantastic we enjoyed seeing a contemporary urban neighborhood with local sidewalk restaurants waterfront walkways and new residential complexes
