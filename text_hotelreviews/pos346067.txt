excelent hotel nice view good breakfast very clean and modern mini bar included perfect if you visit amsterdam with a car near the highway only euros per day for parking tram station by the hotel and only min drive to centraal station but still as whole netherlands a bit expensive but everywhere else is amsterdam is even more expensive and without breakfast and mini bar
