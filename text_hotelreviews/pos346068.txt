surprisingly good we were not expecting much of the hotel when we saw it was a tall building in the edge of a residential area the hotel has three floors the top floors of the building room was very big and offered some drinks in the minibar at recepetion you could have tea coffee and water for free any time breakfast was very nice all you can ask for i totally recommend you have breakfast here because of the quality and secondly in the area there is not much around tram into centre of amsterdam is direct and takes around min that is brilliant
