the room in this charming and efficient boutique hotel was sparkling clean with a comfortable bed and lovely bathroom the storage space was smart and ample and i loved the in room espresso machine the room was also very quiet not a sound from the outside the staff couldn t have been more friendly and accommodating i highly recommend it s a few blocks off the champs elyssee a two block walk min and it s nice that it s in a mixed residential and commercial area i was a woman traveling alone and felt very safe and secure in the surroundings
