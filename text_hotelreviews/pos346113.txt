the bed was comfortable and we slept well it seemed a little far from the centre of amsterdam but using the tram that was not an issue i think we had a nicer hotel being further out the staff was helpful and understanding when i asked for a room with a different view they gave it to us facilities were good wifi worked well free coffee and beer in the room
