the bed was comfortable the stuff friendly and informed wi fi connection ok you have a night bus station very close of hotel useful if u have a very early morning flight the lobby is nice decorated sort of like a boutique hotel you have an intimate feeling as the hotel is only on floors plus u have a lovely view to the sea
