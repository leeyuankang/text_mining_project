the hotel is peaceful and my room had a view on the water by the reception the hotel offers complimentary tea coffee water still or sparkling all day to guests with a choice of teas it s a small touch but makes the hotel stand out from some others although no restaurant the hotel orders helps you order food from local places the bar seating area is ambient and has a nice atmosphere during sunset the bed was very comfortable you literally sink into it
