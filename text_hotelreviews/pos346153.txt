despite of being a bit off the main city the tram no line provided a quick and reliable connection to the main train station travel time around mins with the rail connection to the airport around mins my single bed was cosy with a functional bathroom there was a small problem with the shower in the room that was quickly resolved the staff was very helpful it was very nice to have complimentary drinks and a fast and reliable internet connection there are small shops incl a supermarket and restaurants nearby offering an alternative for breakfast lunch dinner or when looking for a gift prices are somewhat higher in amsterdam in general though but you get a good value for it
