hotel staff and location were perfect we had issues prior to arrival the staff were very patient and understanding it is around a minute tram ride from the amsterdam centraal train station tram line is just outside the hotel and the trams are very regular i would suggest getting the travel pass for days which will get you the train from the airport amsterdam centraal and then the tram toward iburg lovely bakery vinny s up the road if you do not get breakfast included and lovely italian restaraunt also hotel is above apartments very modern quiet free coffee etc in both rooms and in the reception area most comfy bed i ve ever been in
