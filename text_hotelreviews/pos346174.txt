the building and rooms are new silent facilities are good not too far away from the city centre neighborhood environment is nice just a residential area especially like the free mini bar with coke and heineken and also the girl at the front desk who lead me to the room explain everything clearly which make me feel a very warm welcome other responses say it is hard to find the entrance but i think it is very easy just need to note the reception is not on the ground floor and need to press the button to ask for opening the door to go to f s reception the last train from the central station is which is good enough for me and it just take me mins back to the station nearby the area looks very safe even i walk alone at on the street
