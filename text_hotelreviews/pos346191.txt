the entrance to the hotel is strange as you enter via a typical private apartment entrance enter the lift to the floor and then you are in the hotel in every sense of the word the very professional and welcoming reception staff welcome you and explain everything to be honest they could not have been more helpful explaining the city and also about a hour unlimited tram access card for euros available to buy from reception very good value and made getting around the city very easy and cheap the furniture and style of the hotel is stunning great attention to detail nice clean lines and the room was beautifully presented and had everything you could want or wish for not the largest of rooms but not small very clean and large comfy bed we had a problem with fusing the lights and it was attended to immediately and someone came up from reception to make sure we were ok the breakfast was good nicely laid out and they would cook eggs omelet etc for you on demand and with anything you wanted to go with it its a long time since i have been to a hotel where everything was so clean and welcoming i was unsure if the hotel was too far out of the city when booking but because we were driving and the hotel have parking close by at euros per day rather than per day in the center i decided to try there is a tram stop outside the hotel and armed with our cards we hopped on and off the trams during our two day stay never having a problem finding out where we wanted to go the min tram ride into the city was easy quick clean and efficient on saturday night we were later that when the trams stop running and it was euros for four of us to get back to the hotel the savings on the parking more than made up for that i would recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i am booking the hotel for myself and four friends in july which is the highest recommendation
