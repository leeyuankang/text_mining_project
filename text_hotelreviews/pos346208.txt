very nice hotel the room was very nice and we even got an upgrade when we arrived at the hotel the view over the city is amazing the staff was very friendly and helpful the next tram station is a few minutes by feet and the tram takes you in just about minutes to the main station or back from there all day tickets are parking in the hotel nearby shopping mall is day
