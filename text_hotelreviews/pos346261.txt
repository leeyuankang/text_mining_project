a bit further out of town but tram right out front so central station minutes ride in a new built area on floor but nice views across the water fantastic staff very helpful and welcoming it worked perfectly for me to rest up from the inner city but be close by and walk the waterfront good facilities post office supermarket chemist all next door but not if you want bars and night life a affordable option i would certainly stay again
