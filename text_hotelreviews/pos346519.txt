they upgraded me to a suite which was gorgeous the hotel and facilities are beautiful i was very surprised as it was at a much higher standard than hotels in the area which are not much cheaper the location is very nice and in a good place for the station or danzigerkade where i was working i didn t get a chance to go but there is a bagel and beans across the road and i love that place
