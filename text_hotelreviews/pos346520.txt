the hotel was beautiful and the location was perfect to where we wanted to be the staff were brilliant we had a problem with the door in our first room and when they couldn t fix it they moved us to another room which was one floor below the first room the views from both rooms were lovely we faced the north of amsterdam and had some beautiful water views
