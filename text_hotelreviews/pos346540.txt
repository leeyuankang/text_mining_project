this hotel was lovely and modern and while it was a short walk from everything going on in the jordaan section of amsterdam it was pleasantly quiet in the evenings the bed was extremely comfortable and our room wonderfully spacious my husband found it s facilities very easy to have meetings as there were lots of places available to sit and talk the breakfasts were very good and the hotel faced west so it received plenty of afternoon sun really a great place to stay with very pleasant and accommodating staff
