excellent location for a hotel in the river which is reflected in the price its always high here but somehow got a reasonable mid week deal a pleasant walk in the sunshine from central station and a relaxing beer sitting under a parasol surrounded by boats in the marina large room by amsterdam standard all window so lots of light no balcony view of the marina and city looking onto the river costs more super shower and shampoos fast internet excellent bars cafes a short walk along the westerdok quiet and peaceful on the river at night mints on the bar
