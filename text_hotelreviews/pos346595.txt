staff are amazing beds are so comfy views fantastic the cocktails in the bar are exceptional and we had a really lovely time in the restaurant looking out on the water drinking wine i was a bit dubious about booking this hotel as the price was so reasonable i thought there must be a catch and expected us to be disappointed with tired d cor etc i could not have been more wrong the hotel is so luxurious and is lit up so beautifully on a night for the price you really cannot get better
