room and toilet size is really big very clean too we got the water view but couldn t go out to the balcony though so that s a bit weird good value for money given how big the room is and we got offered welcome drinks the staff are also really helpful we ve had a dreadful arrival from paris wallet got stolen and our baggage got left behind in paris never ever fly with klm again even though we were flying home the next day staff helped to call klm service number to ask for us the whereabouts of our baggage when the klm airport staff themselves refuse to call for us and organise to have it delivered on the next flight
