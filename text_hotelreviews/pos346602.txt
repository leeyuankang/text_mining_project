excellent hotel with a very good trade off between price and quality we liked that the breakfast was served until that was great we also loved the fact that the hotel has baby sitter service great that we we had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of nights in ams we loved so much that we cam back at the same hotel and room at the end of our vacations in europe
