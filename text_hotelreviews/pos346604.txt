the staff were fantastically helpful there were always plenty of people at the front desk to help at many fancier hotels sheraton hilton they are perpetually understaffed and have short waiting lines only for executive club members here there was no need they really went out of their way to help and provide information etc outstanding service the room was large and comfortable with plenty of nice towels and shampoo the wifi was fine on my last morning they opened the breakfast minutes early to accommodate me since i had to leave for my flight that was really excellent service bike rental place and a nice cafe right across the street made it very convenient i didn t rent a bike but the idea of it was nice
