we liked almost everything the hotel in general the rooms breakfast is served until noon which is perfect for the party animals we used the babysitting services nights and it was perfect for us that travelled with our years old son it is very closed to the trains station and to the tours in the canal or with the red bus we never took a taxi and always walked everywhere even though is not the best located hotel we spent weeks in europe and ams was our first stop we liked it so much that we decided to come back and we booked on the same hotel i believe that is a good reference per se
