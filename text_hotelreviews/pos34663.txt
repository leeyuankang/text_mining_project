i paid for a club room on booking com and when i got my room room the photos did not match the ones on booking com i was told to complain to booking com about it but the photos are still up on the site and i feel if the rembrandt are going to be available on booking com they should make sure it is correct i was moved begrudgingly to a better room but it had soft decaying apples on the table and the bathroom was small the rooms seriously need a renovation if someone is paying more than au per night i chose the rembrandt imagining i would get an elite hotel and found it old and tired i tried to print out a book contract on the computers in the lobby and the printer had run out of ink i assume this is supposed to be the business centre a table with two computers and a printer in the lobby i had to organise to get someone from the front desk to print it and they weren t overly impressed none of this suggests a hotel with as many stars or costs as much as it does the breakfast was pretty bad the eggs overcooked not runny the tomatoes waterlogged and the juice containers appeared dirty and had drip tray saucers underneath again i would not expect this from a hotel like the rembrandt the bar lounge was ok but i wouldn t expect to have televisions playing in there and it was largely empty with very old carpet and furnishings i m afraid i was really disappointed in the experience and will stay somewhere else next time just as a note a club room should only be called a club room if you have a club lounge i booked this room also believing i would have access to a club room for the extra money i paid it is deceptive and i was told many other people had mistaken the same thing call it something else
