the hotel is fantastic great location minutes walk from the centraal station and about minutes on foot to the dam square across the street from the hotel is a bagels and beans and a small fresh foods store we booked a junior suite and it was clean comfortable spacious and there were complimentary nespresso capsules the staff were very friendly and helpful i would definitely stay there again
