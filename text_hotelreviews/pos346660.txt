the staff members at the front desk and the concierge s desk were very helpful especially when they helped me not only successfully navigate my way to amsterdam s centraal station but also to confirm the transfer from the hotel to the cruise ship terminal the rooms are very nice but if you want a nice room that overlooks the river ij ask for one that does so because the room i got looked over an office building and an apartment building rather than river views i chose the hotel because the movenpick wasn t available and the other hotel available by the cruise line screamed business traveler note trams are a great way to explore the city if you re not a bicycle rider ditto for walking and canal boats i d like a better explanation of how to ride those water taxis using the i amsterdam transport cards do not trust tram operators to tell you how to get to centraal station the main station for boarding trams and trains you will get lost if you rely on them to give you accurate directions i did just that got lost and had to flag down a taxi to take me to my hotel this was especially the case w the operator of tram regarding the food and beverage service at room mate aitana i found the bar service to be very attentive especially if you ask for munchies to go w your beverages they also have a great selection of belgian beers regarding food i only experienced the breakfast service at the hotel which was provided free of change to hotel guests as a buffet chefs please try to make your scrambled eggs taste less yolky than what i had the water and oj glasses were held on a high shelf and should be taken down to a lower shelf for better accessibility the fruits and pastries were terrific ditto for the bacon
