this is a great place to stay when in amsterdam it is not smack in the center which i like but only ten minutes walk from the rail station all the staff are pleasant and nothing is to much trouble the beds are super comfy and i have the best nights sleep away when i stop here this was our third stay in months so says everything this is the only hotel we will stop at in amsterdam thank you room mate aitana
