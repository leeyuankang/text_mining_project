very very nice hotel fresh new building all things function well of course clean located in a quiet clean area we always prefer this in the waterfront minutes for walking to the central station any city site is easily reachable by tram from this point and the same for arriving at prinsengracht sufficiently large say sqm room btw all rooms are daylightful a pretty comfortable space supplying bar guest friendly reception staff they provided to us three rooms one after the other keeping the same price from our booking com reservation euros per night in the july beginning with taking into account our requirements when asked by us a bit unsatisfied by the first two rooms for another room you don t feel that the hotel is not a luxury one warmly recommend it
