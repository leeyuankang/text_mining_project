short walk from the central station the room was great and really comfortable excellent facilities and the minibar was spot on with lots of choice very helpful staff lounge bar area good with decent choice of drinks didn t have breakfast at the hotel as found it overpriced there s bagel beans literally across the street so you can eat there for the price area safe and great for a morning evening jog you need to remember this is not in the center of amsterdam so if you re out and about sightseeing for the whole day there is still a bit of walking to do to get back to the hotel
