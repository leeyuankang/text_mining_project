all of the staff went above and beyond to give excellent customer service from the front desk to the chamber maids nothing was too much trouble excellent breakfasts with everything you could possibly want bright modern rooms just fabulous and our two friends who we had booked for as well loved it too the provision of computers and printer for guest use complimentary was an unexpected bonus and the checkout and breakfast times were nice and long so you really could relax from the first moment til the last one of the best hotel stays we have ever had thank you
