room mate aitana is a new and funky hotel the design of the hotel gives it the feel of a smaller hotel than it actually is the rooms are bright clean and comfortable the rooms were also quiet i couldn t hear anyone in either adjoining rooms or in the corridors the staff were without exception pleasant and helpful when i checked in i was given a map and an offer of assistance with advice or booking of tours i know the location has been raised by some reviewers there is a cycle hire shop immediately opposite the hotel reception the hotel recommended the company i completely agree with the recommendation nice people and very reasonable price i hired a bike for four days and ended up enjoying the ride to and from the hotel to all the places in amsterdam that i visited aitana is a good option i d absolutely stay here again and recommend it to travellers to lovely amsterdam
