was lovely hotel staff were amazing the bath was so deep and the bed was so comfy i wanted to take them both home with me locations abit out there but it s worth it for the view it only takes about to walk into town though the breakfast was lovely with a good choice pretty much anything you want would defo recommend the hotel and would stay there again
