the hotel was very stylish the staff were very helpfull we showed up hours before our check in time but room mate still had a room ready for us you can also check in your suit case so you don t have to drag it around amsterdam the location is good about minute walk away from central station and about a minute walk away from amsterdam square this is a very nice hotel to stay in i would recomend
