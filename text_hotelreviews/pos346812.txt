location is very nice away from the crowds but you can still walk to dam square and many attractions the front desk employees are very helpful they gave us many recommendations on where to go and what to do during our stay breakfast is expensive but there is a bagel restaurant facing the hotel that has amazing view and yummy cheap breakfast rooms are big in size compared to europe hotels
