the location of the hotel was perfect for us not right in the centre and only less than mins walk from the station there was a bike rental place across the road from the hotel with an underground bike park which was ideal and also a lovely healthy bagel shop if you didn t want to spend the extra and go with the b b option we will definitely be returning and using this hotel as our base next time we visit oh yes the dinner in the hotel was really good too
