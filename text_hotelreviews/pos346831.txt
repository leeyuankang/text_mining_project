we stayed five nights over christmas week the staff esp daniel on the front desk ensured that we were comfortable and he made time to check we got any advice we wanted it is a very stylish hotel indeed we upgraded to a corner suite well designed and large we had one meal in the hotel it was excellent the position is about minutes walk through the back of the railway station so handy for the sights the wifi was efficient and worked all over the hotel not just in the room
