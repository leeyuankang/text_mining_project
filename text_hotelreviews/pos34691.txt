we loved the location of this hotel right opsite the victoria albert museum and the older style and character we had a very quiet room that was clean and comfortable we did appreciate the complimentary bottle of wine delivered to our room for our anniversary breakfast was great often very busy and overflowed into the lounge but we were always looked after and the service was excellent we will certainly return here when next in london
