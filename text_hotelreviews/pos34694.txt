we have stayed here once before perfect location less than minutes from tube station bars restaurants shops and museums our rooms were not ready for us at the relevant time but we were upgraded one room after a short delay the only downside was that there was a pack of old cheese left in the mini bar from a previous guest we did not report this at the time as we had better things to spend our time doing my young niece reported that she had lost her mobile phone once reported the staff sprung into action to sort this out extremely attentive all in all great service
