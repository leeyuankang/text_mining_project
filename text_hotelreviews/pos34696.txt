staff were super friendly and helpful and i m not saying that only because i got an upgrade the style of the property is probably not the most modern however the standard of the equipment and amenities was top very nice and wide range of breakfast buffet selection too it s conveniently located right across the street from the victoria and albert museum and the htb church
