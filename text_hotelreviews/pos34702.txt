have stayed in the rembrandt a number of times over the years it s my favourite hotel in london we were upgraded to a club room the bed was the softest i ve ever slept in in any hotel the fruit and salad bar at breakfast had been expanded since my last visit there in september now there was even more choice and the eggs at breakfast were lovely
