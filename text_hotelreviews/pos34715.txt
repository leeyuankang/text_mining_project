the fantastic location of the hotel makes this a perfect choice for visiting london easy walking distance to the natural history museum science museum and literally on the doorstep of the v a also very close to tube station and harrods etc what s not to like the hotel room although very traditional and perhaps slightly dated was extremely spacious clean comfortable and quiet all the usual luxuries you expect were included in addition to a fruit bowl bottled water coffee maker bathrobe slippers etc breakfast which was included in the room rate was fantastic everything was provided and there was nothing i could fault here the foyer bar area and restaurant very comfortable another added bonus was the quality of the room service menu we were so tired our first night we opted for this choice and were not disappointed with the speed of service quality of food and value for money
