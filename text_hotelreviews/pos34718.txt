the staff were very friendly and approachable the whirlpool bath was amazing i am a very fussy breakfast eater and found this hotel had a great choice and tasted delicious it s an excellent location for visiting the royal albert hall and the natural history museum science museum and a lot more besides with underground stations close by will definitely stay here again
