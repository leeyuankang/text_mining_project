amazing london location walking distance to fulham road and and it s eateries pubs etc plus the area is not too busy easy to drive to we came from hampshire and pretty much missed all the london traffic on the way in very comfy hotel we had double beds in our room and quite a nice view from the room welcome cookie upon arrival nice touch
