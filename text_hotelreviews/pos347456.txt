the property was lovely very clean the rooms were light and airy the bathroom facilities were great too the bath was low to floor i suffer with m e and sometimes have difficulties stepping up and the shower was invigorating too the staff are very professional and they made me feel at ease i was welcomed at the property after a very difficult morning by a friendly smile and a nice warm chocolate cookie
