there was an issue on arrival as we had booked adults and child but at the hotel they only had information about the adults i had taken the paperwork confirming the numbers so there was no dispute they did not have a pull out bed so we ended up sharing this was fine in the end but the duty manager and all her staff were lovely and couldn t have been more helpful we even were given complementary breakfast the booking system between booking com and the hotel needs reviewing to avoid this in the future
