the warm cookie upon arrival after hours of train connections and a minute walk was lovely our room was tidy comfortable and much larger than other rooms i ve had in london the location was a bit out of the way not on the tube line but right next to the overland and once the construction barriers are removed the walk along the thames will be lovely
