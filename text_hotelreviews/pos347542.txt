big disappointment was the room temperature air was shut off in the middle of the night both nights and i was awakened to awful heat when i told front desk all they said was it s an automatic system and if i ever visit again request that it be over ridden to remain on for the price i would expect a comfortable night s sleep very disappointing room was fine other than that one thing be sure to ask them to leave on the air they are close to railway and underground and tesco shopping market
