the staff were very helpful and quick assisted us straight away every time we asked for room service we asked for something to put flowers into and they came straight away with a tall glass and scissors to cut the stems as we checked in they recognised us from a previous stay and that just shows how much attention they pay towards their guests and to top it off we got minutes late when checking out and when we came to pay they told us not to worry about it as they would give it complimentary we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others
