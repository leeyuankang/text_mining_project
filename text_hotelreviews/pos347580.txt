great location beside the overground rail easy access to gatwick airport thru clapham junction so no need to go to victoria station going into town it was one stop to the district line tube station two bus stops close by and we used them several times to get to places like sloane square and victoria bus terminal very short walk to the thames and water side restaurants had all our breakfasts at the hotel full range from continental to full english breakfast had a dinner in the lounge and very pleased with service and food finally there is a tesco express right across the street
