the reception staff were very friendly and competent the room was comfortable and clean though a little too hot but that s so subjective the location was perfect i was visiting london design week at chelsea harbour and everything one would expect of a business hotel was provided so for the purpose this hotel was ideal i would certainly go back if visiting this particular part of london on business
