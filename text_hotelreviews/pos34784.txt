i was upgraded to a superior double which was well appointed and comfortable having to use the key card to access the lift made me feel very safe the staff were helpful friendly and efficient the full english breakfast was very tasty and set me up for a day s sightseeing the location was excellent though the roadworks made travelling by bus very slow not the hotel s fault
