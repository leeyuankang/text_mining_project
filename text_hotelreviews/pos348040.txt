excellent and friendly staff were the first experience but my personal favorite value for the hotel is the location it s both extremely close to two world class museums i didn t visit the modern art museum this trip so possibly and in a very quiet and safe area amsterdam is amazing but the tourists can be a bit much after awhile so it was absolutely wonderful to walk back to the hotel on a quiet and peaceful street with gorgeous architecture on both sides absolutely lovely
