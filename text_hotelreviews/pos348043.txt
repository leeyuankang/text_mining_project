this was a surprise trip for my boyfriend s birthday and also celebrating years together i had requested for a bottle of cava and cake to be in the room upon arrival and as we checked in they upgraded us to a nice room and when we got to the room they had decorated it with balloons as well as made sure the cava was cold and the brownie cake with ice cream was ready to eat they gave us great recommendations on restaurants and must see places during out day visit the staff was great so friendly and service minded the room was decent size with plenty of space and the bathroom had a bubble bath jacuzzi style bathtub the bed was really comfy i mean really comfy wished we could have taken the bed with us home lol there was robe slippers and toiletries and a nespresso machine the breakfast was good too small buffet but you find pretty much everything you want on it and the also have a small a la carte menu which is included in the buffet as well the location is really good super close to museums the iamsterdam sign and there s trams and buses just one block away from the hotel very convenient if you don t want to walk pretty much everything about the hotel and our stay was great
