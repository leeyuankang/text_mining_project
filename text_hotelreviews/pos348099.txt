we would recommend this property to any of our friends and we would certainly re book this hotel ourselves the location is perfect seconds from the wonderful museum quarter and the facilities are impeccable but it s the staff that make this hotel a winner the staff definitely go the extra mile to make sure amsterdam feels like home they provide you with any assistance you may need from restaurant recommendations to wonderful dutch treats thanks to all but a special thanks to thomas for making amsterdam so memorable
