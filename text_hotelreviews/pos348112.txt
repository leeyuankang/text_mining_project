the reception staff were very welcoming and informative i booked a twin room for myself and grown up daughter it was very spacious with a fabulous bathroom the jacuzzi bath being the star the hand basin was actually in the main room unusual but it was ok everywhere was very clean and decorated in a contemporary style excellent choice for breakfast hot and cold buffet on offer with delicious local bread too the hotel is in a very quiet street right by the main museums yet very easy to access all of the city either by walking or by tram i would stay here again without hesitation
