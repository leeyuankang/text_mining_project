the hotel is very well located within the museum area much more pleasant and quiet than the very central one one can get there however by foot or tram very fast rooms are pleasant but nothing special they have nespresso and tea machines in every room breakfast is good so are the dishes you can order during the day evening in the lobby they have coffee and lemonade all day long
