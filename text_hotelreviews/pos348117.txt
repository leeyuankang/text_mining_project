this hotel is a real gem in a great location for getting to everything you need in amsterdam a short walk to the main museums and a walk to the main city centre you could also jump on a tram which is very close to the hotel too but why when you can soak up the beautiful city of amsterdam the hotel is a bus ride from the hotel the bus drops you literally outside the hotel very easy to find and removes the stress of getting to the airport i imagine a taxi would be pretty cheap too but the bus was like euros its also a walk to the lovely area of pjip where you can find some really good brunch and eat out places we upgraded to the bigger room which was definitely worth doing the room was one of the best rooms that we ve stayed in with everything that we needed the bed was really comfortable and it was double bed not singles put together like many other hotels we did t watch the tv much but it was nice that there were channels in english the staff were brilliant too very attentive and quick to respond when we had a minor issue with our safe not working i would definitely stay in this hotel again because of the location and the sheer quality of the rooms
