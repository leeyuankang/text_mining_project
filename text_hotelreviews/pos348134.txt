the staff all of them spoke good english and helpful all the receptionists gave us a good impression always going the extra mile to ensure we were assisted to our satisfaction the breakfast was good although it was the same everyday which can be boring in a way maybe they can change the menu once in a while there is a nice sitting area where coffee is available on the ground floor the hotel depends on the honesty of the guests to pay for the drinks which is a cool thing it is close to all the sights rijksmuseum van gough food etc and if you take uberx from the central station but you can easily take the tram to get there for euro with uber it only cost you euro or less location is fantastic as the airport express bus is within minutes walk from the hotel it is the rijksmuseum stop for both the tram and the airport express
