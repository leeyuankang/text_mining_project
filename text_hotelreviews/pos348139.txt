the location in the museum quarter matched our concertgebauw booking precisely and enabled us to take in the rijksmuseum on the same day yes open on a monday breakfast was good quality and service efficient we had an executive room and the bed and the spa bath met our expectations via trip advisor we found the seafood bar which is close by and the meal before the concert was superb
