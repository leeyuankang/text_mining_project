the hotel is very central without being in the noisy hub of the city we walked everywhere but if a tram was needed it is only minutes away from the tram connection the hotel is very pretty and has more space in the bedroom than boutique hotels usually would and the large king size bed was really comfortable the bath was a real treat too
