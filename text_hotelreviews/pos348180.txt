from the minute we were greeted at reception until the minute we left the hotel the staff was kind and helpful the location is excellent easy stroll to museums restaurants trams a very quiet street in the center of the museum area the front desk staff had tickets for museums so that one didn t need to stay in lines during busy times there was flavored water available when returning to the hotel and a nice honor bar with coffee wine beer and drinks the elevator is a treat all is all a wonderful stay and we would return
