the rembrandt has the perfect location for us right in front of the victoria albert museum a block from the history and science museums mins walking to the kensington palace and in the opposite direction the great shops and restaurants on brompton rd knightsbridge in the mornings we eat the best full english breakfast the room is comfortable great bed and pillows and it has everything we could wish for fridge coffee tea and biscuits iron and iron board safe and the tv channels has other channels than the news ones in the evenings we always stop at the bar for a nice licorice and mint tea to finish our day in a great style excellent atmosphere people in the hotel and restaurant are polite and make us feel like royalty these are some of the reasons we always come back to rembrandt and have the greatest time ever
