location is about minutes away from the bus from the ams airport and the trams to centraal station it s also close to vondelpark the major museums and lots of bars and restraurants we joined a river cruise after our stay and took the tram to centraal and walked about minutes to the gct ship at dock very nice and quiet room with a large bed and good wifi we didn t do breakfast so we don t know about that our flights were delayed so we arrived a full day late so they charged us for the first night minus taxes and fees per their policy all in all it was an excellent choice for most travellers
