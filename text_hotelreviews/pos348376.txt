location a couple of minute walk to van gogh museum stedelijk museum and rijksmuseum i didn t do stedelijk but if you want to do one of each of these museums a day this is the perfect location to stay in my opinion as an added bonus there s albert heijn grocery store chain right next to stedelijk van gogh museum so i could just grab some food and other necessities on my walk back to the hotel and i loved it the street on the other side of the hotel is lined up with high end stores louis vuitton gucci hermes etc and well lit so it s nice and safe to stroll around at night also it s a short walk to the canal and a tour boat office blue boat during my stay they had this christmas illumination canal tour going at night watercolors so i booked a tour the tour started from the office location so it was very convenient bath tub very nice size bath tub i m and i could stretch all out in the bath tub if you like taking a bath after a long day of museum visiting like i do don t forget to bring your favorite bath salts or bath bomb was hard to find in stores while staying amenities the room was equipped with little luxuries like an espresso machine hot water pot different glasses for different types of drinks a fridge a big mirror behind it there s an iron and ironing board stuff that s nice to have but not always available at the same time at other places i ve stayed much appreciated staff every staff member i interacted with was courteous and professional and it made my stay a pleasant one when i checked in i arrived around and a twin room two beds not double was ready at first i mentioned i d just leave my luggage and wait for the double room to become available but then i changed my mind while putting my luggage down really wanted to take a bath and a nap after my flight
