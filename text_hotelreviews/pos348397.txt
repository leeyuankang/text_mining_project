very nice hotel in an excellent location the service on the front desk was very helpful and courteous this is a traditional and quite smart hotel with a calm atmosphere perfect for a relaxed break my room was unexpectedly huge and had a balcony overlooking a very picturesque street scene the bed was very comfortable with good quality linen the bathroom well equipped and spotless recommended
