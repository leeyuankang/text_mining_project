of all the hotels near museumplein this hotel takes the prize we have stayed at piet hein several times and enjoyed it but when you get older being less than blocks from van gogh museum and not much further to rijksmuseum and stedeljik is a good thing the building is old world with modern comforts room front desk were great wonderful restaurants nearby
