fantastic location just down the road from museum square and bus tram stop direct connections to schiphol airport and amsterdam centraal take a walk from amsterdam centraal to the hotel and you ll pass by most of the city s sights lots of eateries and shops all around although most close by staff were friendly and helpful as a solo female traveler i felt completely safe walking around the area even at night
