we had a split stay at jan luyken nights first and then nights after a trip to brugges the staff was nothing more than pleasant and responsive to every request we had rooms at the back of the hotel with a pleasant view of neighboring gardens the hotel is located within easy walking distance to the museumplein and trolley stop that gives you access to all of amsterdam
