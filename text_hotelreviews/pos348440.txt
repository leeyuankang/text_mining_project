the location was excellent for our trip on a quiet street near the museums lots of shopping around the corner restaurants and cafes nearby the hotel staff was wonderful they made you feel welcome and at home we had a couple of special requests and they followed through exactly as we requested overall it was our favorite place we stayed during our trip
