we were looked after from before we arrived until we left because of a mistake i made we needed to change the date the hotel could not have been more helpful on arrival the room was not really to our liking but we were offered another room immediately the hotel has everything you would expect from hotel and is in an excellent location for exploring london i would recommend it highly
