the most positive hotel experience i ve ever had in a hotel perfect location room a bit small but very clean calm and confortable and above all absolutely nicest staff they really make you feel special and welcome our dog even got treats and a drinking bowl we arrived early so the room wasn t ready we left the lugguage and when we came back later the room was ready and the lugguage already in the room which doesn t happen all the time in hotels will be back soon
