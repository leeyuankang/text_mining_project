very nice mid level hotel nicely situated in knightbridge good for museum seekers as it s right across the road from the v a and a short walk from the museum of natural history also a block walk to harrod s the surrounding area is quite nice for walking around and it s just a minute walk to south kensington tube stop the rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable we also had a small balcony and could open the windows which we loved there s free wifi and the elevators worked and were fast we had no complaints at all and would stay there again
