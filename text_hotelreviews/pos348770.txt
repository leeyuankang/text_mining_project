the hotel apartment was a big quite lofty space with a table that we could eat and sit at a good air condition with changeable temperature it had a little cooking space just when we got inside with a door to the rest of the space there we found not all that we needed but most of the missing things we could ask for in the reception or the hotel restaurant the hotel was overall fresh relatively clean friendly and not to far away from the city metro the hotel was also close to numerous food stores and restaurants and also just behind a shoppingcenter with a supermarket inside
