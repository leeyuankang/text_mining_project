very well located hotel just minutes from metro station which takes you to the city center few supermarkets close to the hotel so you can cook or prepare some snacks as there is a small kitchen in the room there was also street market with fresh fruit vegetable bread etc few minutes from hotel room was spacious and quiet breakfast was excellent great and wide choice it is also possible to have a breakfast in one of the cafe s next to hotel and dinner in local restaurants which are cheaper comparing to those in the city center
