the location is great as it is close to les corts where you can catch a metro or a bus to anywhere in the city or beach for euro no need to pay higher prices to stay in the city centre we didn t use the restaurant so cannot comment on that the rooms are big and bright with big windows and good views there are free daily newspapers in the lobby every morning for guests to read
