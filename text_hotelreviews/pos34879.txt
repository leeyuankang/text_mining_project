all the staff we met were friendly helpful polite and attentive the bedroom was well appointed as was the bathroom for once there was somewhere to place sponge bags etc and a magnifying mirror which is now essential alas the location was perfect for our needs close to the tube museums and knightsbridge there were plenty of places to eat nearby we will definitely stay again
