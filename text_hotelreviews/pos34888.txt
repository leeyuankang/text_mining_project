this trip was all about location for us a little christmas shopping up the road and we had tickets to a candlelight christmas concert at the rah and this was close enough to walk this was a lovely treat our christmas present to each other we asked for a room near stairs lift on the first floor as my husband is claustrophobic they honored this request when booking which was lovely of them
