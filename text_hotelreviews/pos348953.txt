staff we helpfull and pleasant rooms were comfortable and clean and the air conditioning worked well there is a sauna and steam room but we didnt use these if you enjoy cycling there is a lovely track in a rural part of amsterdam close to the hotel you can hire the bicycles the hotel is located in a quiet and less built up part of the city which we found nice as it wasnt noisy at night it is a minute walk to the overamstel metro station which makes it very easy to access any part of the city it is also stops from the zuid station where you can get the train to schipol airport
