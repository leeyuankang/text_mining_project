the hotel was really good considering the price it was perfect the personnel was very helpful and welcoming they were always there and did their best to assist us for example print something out or show us the easiest route to get somewhere each morning we had a nice long breakfast what was very convenient as we could come at or have a late breakfast at and even after it was over we could remain their as long as we liked concerning the room service i would like to say that they most time managed to clean the room while we were out or having breakfast this way they did not bother us at all despite the industrial surrounding the hotel was minute walk from the metro station and had a nice sunny terrase overlooking the canal
