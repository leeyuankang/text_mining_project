after reading other reviews i was a bit sceptical i was worried about the distance to the city as that s what most people seem to complain about however i believe they re talking a load of rubbish it was so close a minute walk at the most if you re walking slowly to the metro station whereas other reviews stated it a minute walk then a short journey on the metro to the city it did not take long at all i found it very convenient i had a room on the floor lovely rooms and very comfortable twin beds also went to a concert at the ziggo dome the hotel was in good proximity to there as well easy public transport
