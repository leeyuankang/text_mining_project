the hotel staff were extremely helpful and polite i had reserved a standard double room but was upgraded to a superior room at no additional expense which was greatly appreciated the room was very spacious with lots of extra trimmings and a great view of the city the loung area is lovely to sit and chat in and the food served there is good and well presented
