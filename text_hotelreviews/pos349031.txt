the hotel was utterly excellent perfect location with a very short walk to the train station and then a short hope on the train into the centre of amsterdam the hotel staff could not have been more information and helpful from the reception staff to the bar and restaurant staff and also the cleaners our room was cleaned and immaculate each day nico on reception was a real star on information of where to go in and around amsterdam and organising our bike hire the hotel has bike hire on site and the bike were brand new and very good price for rate we managed to cycle for around amsterdam and so easy to start and finish at the hotel the food was excellent and breakfast you could not have wanted any more all freshly prepared and refreshed when empty and a huge variety on offer there is nothing at all wrong with this hotel its staff food or location utterly perfect on all fronts the only thing wrong is the utterly idiotic comments guest have made on previous reviews about having to walk the very short distance to the train station unless you have disabilities issues for goodness sake you are staying at a city hotel where you are visiting a city that you will walk around it took us no longer than a slow stroll at worst to reach the station then hop onto a train and later you are smack bang in the centre of amsterdam jeez you may as well stay at home if you can t walk that short distance get a grip people this is a cracking hotel and a great value could not ask for more
