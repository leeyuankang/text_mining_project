the staff were very polite and helpful we didn t eat in the restaurant but it looked pleasant we enjoyed having welcome drinks on the terrace due to our room not being ready the beds were comfy and the room was clean it was only a minute walk to the metro and the links to amsterdam cental and other areas were good
