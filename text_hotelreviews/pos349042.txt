our check in was very pleasant the gentleman who checked us in was very informative he provided a map and made sure that we were well informed regarding local metro sites to see and places to eat he offered to book any tours which we would like to experience he also gave us a leaflet with general information his name and no on arriving in our room we found that it had an unpleasant smell i am guessing the previous occupant had been sick however with one phone call we received an apology and we were immediately moved to a second room exactly the same very clean and comfortable but without the unpleasant sent the hotel offered an incentive which i had not come across before they offered to be redeemed in the bar if you did not want to avail of staff tiding the room as we had arrived in the evening there was no real need also some people prefer to just leave there belongs out and know that staff will not be entering the room the hotel also had a small shop to where you could pick up drinks and snacks or a sandwich
