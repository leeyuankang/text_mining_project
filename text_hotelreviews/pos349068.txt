hotel was beautiful the staff were friendly and the bed was super comfy perfect size for me and my partner as he likes to sprawl out also we recieved a voucher for the bar which was good the metro stop was minutes down the road and although we had to get the tram into the centre it was worth it i couldn t imagine us staying any where else i will definitely be staying here again if i go back
