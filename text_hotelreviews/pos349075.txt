it was a great hotel beautiful inside staff are really friendly and helpful staff on the canal the hotel offers some lovely views of amsterdam offered free use of the spa and sauna facilities for a mercure hotel i expected more of a price tag but very good value for money well worth a stay although a walk from a metro station it s very easy to get to and lots of them that go into the city centre
