when the receptionist found out that we had stayed twice before and it was my husbands birthday the day we checked in she kindly found us an upgrade and wished my husband a very happy birthday i booked consecutive nights but booked each night a few weeks apart i emailed the hotel to ask if we could stay in the same room for the nights when we arrived this was arranged and we was really pleased not to have to move all staff were very welcoming and i will certainly stay again the next time we are in london thank you
