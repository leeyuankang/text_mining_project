staff were lovely room was adequate good towels were far from fluffy could do with some life in them but they were functional closeness to the airport and the metro line good that you could buy a metro card at the hotel at a better price of euro rather than euro at he airport good that they offer to hold your baggage on your last day i would stay again affordable stay
