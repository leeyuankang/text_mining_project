terrible place we missed the flight so we couldn t check in at the promised time then mercure gave our room to another guest while still charging us this means the same room charged two different guests at the same time when we arrived the hotel the staff told us to wait until next day to check in while we still have to pay for previous day s hotel terrible service and terrible value
