friendly staff with great advice and allowed me a late check out modern rooms with super comfy beds and blackout curtains always a bonus although the location is a little out of town i paid the same price for this luxury treat as i would ve paid to stay in a dorm in the town center so glad i did this instead seems to be located near an industrial park business area so not many tourists to annoy you with smoking herbs on every corner
