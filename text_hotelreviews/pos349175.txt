a wonderful hotel with friendly staff always willing to go the extra mile for our comfort we informed the staff on arrival that we where in amsterdam for our first year anniversary we where upgraded to a privlidge room at no extra cost got into our hotel room after a day in the city to find a note congratulating on our anniversary and a small gift of dutch sweets from the front desk staff what a kind gesture ideally located to the metro only a minute walk away and minutes on the metro to central station honestly we could not have stayed at a better place
