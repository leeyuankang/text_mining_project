amazing room really modern clean and spacious the bed was comfortable and the bathroom functional with good lighting really easy to get to and a minute walk from the nearest metro station which is about a minute ride from the city centre there was a great little shop in the hotel open with lovely stroop waffles overall a fantastic stay with brilliantly helpful staff would completely recommend and definitely stay again
