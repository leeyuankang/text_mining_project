the bed was really comfy and it was nice to have our bathroom goodies topped up fault as we needed them the nespresso machine was also a really nice touch the hotel was really close to the metro line so very easy to get into the main part of the city when you wanted but also nice to be away from the hustle and bustle the restaurant food was also really really good
