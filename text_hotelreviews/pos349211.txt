located just outside of city center but easy to access transport very modern looking hotel friendly and helpful service even the cleaning staff make the effort to talk to you rooms have appropriate amount of space beds are super comfortable and the bathroom and rooms are extremely clean i would highly recommend this hotel value for money fyi you will need to pay a city tax either upon arrival or before you check out
