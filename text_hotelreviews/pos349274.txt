the sauna and steam room were great to have in the hotel the staff at the bar were really nice and helpful also some of the staff at the check in area were really helpful also we arrived on an early flight and the staff let us check into the room earlier than the usual pm which was great the one good thing about the room was the view we had of our room was spectacular at night looking out towards the city
