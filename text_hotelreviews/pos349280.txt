i thought the hotel was beautiful the bar and seating area is lovely they ve really made use of all the space first impressions were really good when we were greeted with a lovely member of staff to check us in it is a business hotel but they have floors of rooms which are out to the public privileged rooms as they call it the room was lovely was a little small but there was only of us so wasn t a problem cleanliness was good we stayed for nights and they tidied our room every day we had a really good shower it gave us an option to have the water head as normal and we also had a shower that was on the ceiling too which wasn t ideal for a woman when they don t want to wash their hair hehe but was still good because i could just swap the option and use the other shower we didn t go for the break fast but i m sure we wouldn t have been dissappointed over all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone business or couples definitely live the life of luxury in this hotel
