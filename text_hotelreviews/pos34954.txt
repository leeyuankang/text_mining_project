travelled with my old son upon arrival after a busy day in the natural history museum which is only a five minute walk away the young lady on the check in desk referred to him as a vip and took a genuine interest as to what he had seen at the museum this made his trip the place was really clean all the staff were very child friendly and the room was very nice topped of with a jacuzzi bath room service was quick and really tasty the breakfast buffet style catered for every nationality the full english was brilliant
