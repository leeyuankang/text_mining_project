i liked the hotel as it was nice and quiet i loved the huge bed and the heated bathroom floor there is plenty of storage and an iron ironing board and tea making facilities i had no problems with the wifi which is also free the hotel is on the outskirts of amsterdam but can easily be reached on the tram which stops at a lot of the main attractions so this made it easy to get around it takes about minutes to get to the stop for the hotel and then a minute walk through the housing estate the hotel is very clean and has some nice modern quirky pieces in it the staff are helpful and answer any queries you may have you can download a map off their webpage which tells you what trams buses or metro you need to catch you can also buy and hour gvb bus tickets from them which covers their transport
