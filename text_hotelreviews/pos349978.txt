i liked design of room and facilities shame that heated floor in bathroom did not operate on first night as well only on next day maintenance have sorted that because we have reported comfy beds with memory mattress fresh linen bikes are too expensive double priced at hotel better to rent in city centre fair time spent to get to town centre on tram very quiet location very convenient to have a good night sleep
