hotel was amazing and staff were really helpful and friendly location was really good as well only around a minute walk to the tram station and then an extra minutes on the tram into the centre if you go to rijksmuseum and walk from there which is what we did we didn t have any food at the hotel but menu looked pretty good a bit pricey for us but nice if you want a treat would definitely recommend this hotel
