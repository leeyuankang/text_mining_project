the room was lovely and the staff was very friendly and helpful it s about a minute tram journey to city centre but it was in a quiet area that offered all the necessary transports needed the food there was lovely and all organic and fresh but was a little bit expensive but still delicious loved the whole experience and would definitely stay again
