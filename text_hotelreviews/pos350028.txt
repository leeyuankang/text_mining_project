really comfy and clean room we spent little time in it due to having a fairly full schedule but ticked all the boxes special thanks to the lady who checked us in she was absolutely lovely i got a really good deal as it was obviously one of their quieter periods which was really nice as the hotel seemed very chilled compared to the more bustley centre again we were very busy so it was a nice oasis to return to staff were very helpful in getting us to the early return flight we had also
