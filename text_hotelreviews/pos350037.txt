the room was lovely and the bed chairs were very comfortable the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming while the hotel is further out from the centre of amsterdam it did mean it stayed and peaceful i liked the fact there was a safe in the room meaning i didn t worry about our money or passports if you don t mind travelling into the city everyday it s a great place to stay
