good size room nicely decorated and furnished with super comfy beds helpful staff waterside terrace quiet neighbourhood and quite safe not to mention wild life friendly with ducks and rabbits we came back late from the center almost each day of our stay good value for money ice making machine in the corridor for those worried about the walk to the tram min if you choose the main street min if you go through the park the hotel provides a shuttle to the city center and back against a fee and you have to book it one hour in advance the tram connection was very good and available longer than the shuttle the shuttle was available until if i remember correctly therefore we did not tried the shuttle
