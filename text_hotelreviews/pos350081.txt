very modern hotel with all the comforts you could ask for rooms were slick and stylish and comfy little extras like a water cooler and a shoe shine machine on each floor were a thoughtful bonus bikes are available to hire from reception at euros for half a day and as the hotel is so near to the nieuwe meer oeverlanden and the amsterdam bos i d reccomend you make the most of this we did not eat at the hotel but the restaurant look good the staff were all very helpful and friendly
