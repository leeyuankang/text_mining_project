the location was great staff very friendly and helpful lovely old building and rooms were comfortable and large with nice traditional furnishings breakfast was excellent with a huge choice lots of different cheeses and meat fresh fruit salad and yoghurts bread and pastries we loved the area as just on the outskirts of the inner city so not too touristy or crowded minute walk to museums and minutes to the centre
