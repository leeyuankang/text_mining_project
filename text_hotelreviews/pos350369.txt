had a wonderful stay david at reception was so very helpful and friendly a great asset to the hotel we stayed in one of the privilege rooms which was very nice and comfortable loved the coffee machine in the room which was spotlessly clean the hotel is on a small side street so is nice and quiet but it is within walking distance of everything close to public transport also which we used to get to and from the airport the breakfast was great lots to choose from to set you up for the day would definitely stay here again if we are back in this beautiful city
