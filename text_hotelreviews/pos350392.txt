the area was quite pleasant and once we got the hang of the transport system i felt it was well enough placed but that was not my immediate thought hence my rating the room was quiet and spacious and had a separate seating area with a desk handy for writing post cards and the daily diary the bed was comfortable and we slept well the bathroom was large and well stocked the breakfast room had a very good choice though i never did find the english breakfast tea bags the receptionists were helpful and spoke enough english to order a taxi suggest restaurants etc
