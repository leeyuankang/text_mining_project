the location is good for transport links especially if you are a tram lover the number stops two minutes away easy walk to the centre past the rathaus and as a bonus there is an excellent non smoking cafe opposite the tram stop we had a superior privilege room which was a strange shape with sloping roof even though we weren t on the top floor very bling gold decor i liked the klimpt bathroom door but comfortable clean and with a good walk in shower the street above the hotel has a supermarket some nice niche shops and good restaurants at both ends
