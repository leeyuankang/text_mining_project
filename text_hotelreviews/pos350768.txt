i was in barcelona to celebrate the birth on my first granddaughter who was born in a local hospital and is now living in the area eva enjoyed her first dinner at days old in the hotel roof top restaurant where the staff made her very welcome the graffiti style decoration gives the atmosphere of a boutique hotel which is very appropriate to such a beautiful city the hotel had clearly read the comments i made when i booked which i appreciated the discreet manner in which the roof top restaurant staff dealt with a guest who had clearly had too much too drink
