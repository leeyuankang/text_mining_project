great stuff no request was ever an issue for them helpful reception great service at the pool and during the breakfast good food reasonably priced location was close to the nice beach but further from the city centre which could be not for everyone although it is well communicated through buses metro and tram on the plus side there was also very comfortable bed and we could check in to the room in the morning straight after arrival and enjoy pool and food already
