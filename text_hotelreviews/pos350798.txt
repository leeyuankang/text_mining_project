the location is quite good in case you not prefer to sleep next to the very noisy and crowded citycenter we rented a scooter and it was very easy to moove to everywhere the metro is minutes by walk and minutes you find a very big shoping center with many restaurant the beach is also minutes by walk breakfast is expensive but you find enough food to eat and they cook quite good it was easier to take a breakfast and start our day in the surrounding you find many other opportunity to get food coffe is horrible but all other thing are ok
