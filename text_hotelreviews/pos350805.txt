oh my god the breakfast was a m a z i n g also appreciate the little outdoors space for breakfast and the coziness of the inside restaurant bar the rooms although a bit too artificial in style and quality were very cozy and functional the location is nice if you like taking very long walks along the beaches to reach downtown barcelona and if you like modern lifeless neighbourhoods close to beach close to diagonal mar shopping mall
