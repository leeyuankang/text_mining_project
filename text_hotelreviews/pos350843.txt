nice and modern hotel with friendly and polite service pretty interiors have everything you need during stay i reccomend to check the library in coffee bar and a lovely balcony at last floor where you can rest the location isn t the best if you are first time in town not too close to all attractions but the area is calm with nice buildings around and close to the beach big shopping centre and museum blau there is also a metro station nearby the price was also really attractive comparing to other hotels
