i made a mistake on my reservation dates unfortunately hotel was on high demand and prices where four times what i had paid for just one week later but the manager of reservations mrs eva was kind enough to accept our pre payment for two nights as part of payment for one single night not sure yet this was good or bad at least she showed some flexibility unlike anna at the reception
