we happened upon this hotel as our car rental drop off was across the street we really loved it nice design comfortable and price in relation to the rest of the city was very good it is minutes from a big mall if thats what you re looking for and min from the beach otherwise you would need the metro to most other places of interest worked perfectly for our quick night stay
