the bed was the best i ve ever tried excellent the hotel breakfast was also incredibly good and the staff was lovely and helpful the rooms were bright and clean and the whole property has a wonderful high design feel the location at first seemed far but then you realize how close you are to the beach and the promenade that made for wonderful morning walks
