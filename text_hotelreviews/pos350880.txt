the hotel is really good with nice and wellcoming personnel the rooms are big and clean and the bed very comfortable the hotel is close to the metro and tram and also to the beach aprox min walking without being in a hurry we have stayed here for a week and we would definately come back anytime the price is a bit high but if you search for some offers and promotions then its really worth every cent
