not quite in the city center but the quality of the hotel was worth it we loved doing a trip on foot to visit we could walk to sagrada familia casa milla casa batllo agbar tower all in one day by relaxed walking about round trip very nice and modern interior very comfortable beds very friendly staff very cheap minibar in the room secured underground parking it is very close to a shopping mall and the forum building it is away by car to sagrada familia or away by foot walking but we really enjoyed exploring the city on foot
