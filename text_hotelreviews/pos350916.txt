we liked everything about this hotel from its unique d cor to the wonderful staff it is out of the centre of barcelona but only metres from a metro station tram stop and in a quiet area the staff were most helpful and booked tours for us the breakfast offered an amazing choice of foods the metro to the city centre was swift and the stations in fact the whole city are very clean we loved the hotel and the city of barcelona
