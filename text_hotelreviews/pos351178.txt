the staff certainly contribute to the success of this hotel they were all very friendly efficient couldn t do enough to help you would agree that the entrance to the hotel does not attract but once at reception that all changes we booked the suite it was more like having our own apartment located one floor up in a different part of the building it was quiet clean very spacious kitchen area lounge dining room large bedroom modern bathroom shower relaxation area separate wc tasteful combination of modern fittings with original older building pointed out to the maid that the bath water did not seem to drain away properly technician was there to sort it within minutes wish other hotels were as efficient breakfast dishes were freshly cooked to order hotel restaurant recommendations were very good
