a lovely suitable location in the middle of historical vienna and lots of shops and restaurant the building is an antiquity the suite is designed in a rustic yet modern way we loved it it is private and quite and feels at home the breakfast area is an open kitchen stations the variety is well studied healthy and simple as if your own chef is cooking at home the staff are kind happy and helpful we loved it
