room was spacious and well designed this was especially important given that we were traveling with an infant which required a pack n play in the room our son enjoyed playing with the rubber duckies and the antique telephones the breakfast was probably our favorite part of each day in vienna staff was welcoming and professional location cannot be beat plenty of great restaurants and sites within a very short walk
