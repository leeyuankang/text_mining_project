this place is a gem beautifully designed rooms super comfortable beds thought through concept and beautiful decor if you are looking for friendly comfortable quirky and a tad different then this is the place to go when wandering through the different areas of the hotel you will find little special details everywhere to put a smile on your face the breakfast was lovely the only downside of our stay was that we could only stay for one night
