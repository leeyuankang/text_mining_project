this is the coolest kookiest quirkiest absolute most fantastic boutique hotel we ve been to we usually stay at larger chain hotels but this was the first time traveling to vienna and i figured i don t want to spend the big bucks on chain hotels we won t be spending that much time in the room and the reviews have been great here so let s give it a shot oh boy was i glad i listened to the reviews the hollman is a true gem upon arrival you think you re in the wrong location the entrance is in the most non descript un assuming low key location all you see is a small orange awning with the hotel name walking in it feels like you re going to a speak easy my wife was so far not pleased go though another door to the main elevator where things begin to make sense at reception we re greeted by two extremely gracious and friendly hosts they were so great during our stay happily answering all my annoying tourist questions we re given the low down on the facilities and shown to our room a giant hand written greeting is waiting for us at the front door to our room wow completely unexpected fun and unique the room is gigantic high ceilings hardwood floors mini fridge tv and spacious bathroom free wifi too we were completely thrown aback by the size of the room it was ultra modern and very clean and quiet located in the center of the busy city we could barely hear a horn honk in the evening excellent job on the sound proofing the hotel is perfectly located in the inner stadt it s in the ultimate tourist location you can walk anywhere in the ringstrasse go back to the room to freshen up and leave again to continue exploring other than the opera and train station we didn t need a cab once while we were there breakfast is included in the room fee and what a breakfast it is it s a literal feast from the moment you sit down
