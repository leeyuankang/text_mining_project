the place is very cleverly designed and has interesting features everywhere the common rooms are fun to sit in and have a sip of brandy or iced tea the air conditioning in the room was excellent and much needed in a heat wave the location is very central they located a great guide for us who gave us a very entertaining day full of information and fun they directed me to the riverside running path and in general were very helpful
