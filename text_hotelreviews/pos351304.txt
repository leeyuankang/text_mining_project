the location was fantastic very central to most of the museums and sights we wanted to see for further afield such as the schonbrunn palace there is a metro stop just adjacent to the hotel the facilities at the hotel are of a very high standard and the breakfast options provided something to suit everyone the staff are very helpful and friendly
