we had an awesome room with lots of space and luxury furnishings the common parts of the hotel are very nicely decorated if a tad corporate vienna is sensational and the location was perfect for exploring all of the staff were lovely apart from the slightly stressed concierge guys who although they did well had to think about the next person in line oh and the lift was very quick despite having to service lots of people not sure how but it worked for us
