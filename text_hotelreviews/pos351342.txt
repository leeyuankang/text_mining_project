the room was spacious and comfortable we had a newly refurbished room staff were of high calibre lunch and dinner were excellent but breakfast was very poor we went out for breakfast as the location of the hotel readily permits this the location of the hotel is very good for taking advantage of the superb things that vienna has to offer for example across the street is the greatest concert hall and away is the state opera house fine restaurants are within a short walk the concierge service was also excellent
