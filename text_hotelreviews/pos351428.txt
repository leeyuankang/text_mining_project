the ring hotel is in an ideal location for visiting all the main attractions many of which are within walking distance those which are a bit further out the ferris wheel schonbrunn palace are only a few stops on the u bahn underground and there is a station karlsplatz very close to the hotel the stop for the trams which circle the ringstrasse routes and is close to the hotel too as is the starting point for the hop on hop off sightseeing tours the hotel staff were very helpful and kept us right our room was quite large with a huge comfy bed and was visited by the housekeeping staff twice a day there is a coffee maker in each room but being brits we like a cup of tea and the hotel were happy to provide a kettle etc all in all the ring hotel is a very good choice for a short visit to vienna because it is so conveniently placed and the staff are really pleasant and helpful
