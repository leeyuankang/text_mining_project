everything was spot on but what i really loved is that it felt cosy for a start hotel usually there is a stiffness that comes with the territory as far as relaxing goes even though our room was facing the front boulevard where a lot of cars and trams are passing by there was absolutely no noise whatsoever in the room we traveled with a new born baby and our stay couldn t have been more care free also the fact that breakfast is served up to or on weekends was amazing
