when trying to cancel my reservation because of my bad first night experiences the hotel staff was very friendly and offered me a free upgrade to a more spacious confortable room with also a well functioning air conditioning overlooking the challenges of regular room category in this hotel the x ordinary rooms are good the hotel location is great and the beds are quite soft and above average when compared across similar hotels the staff is also friendly and attentive to the customers needs
