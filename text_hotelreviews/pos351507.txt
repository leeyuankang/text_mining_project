the hotel is great and so is the location which is near the opera theatre the rooms are great especially when we had a one night at the huge rooms with street view felt like a celebrity one of the best things in this hotel is the at eight restaurant with their delicious breakfast highly recommended also there is a trains ticket office beside the hotel so you won t be looking so far to leave vienna
