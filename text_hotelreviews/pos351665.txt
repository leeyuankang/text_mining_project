the hotel is great with pleasant and relaxing atmosphere it is not absolutely perfect it had small downsides but they are doing all their best to satisfy guests and to make their staying comfortable carefree we have to admit very professional and helpful staff don t believe to german guests who write stupidities about staff they are always unhappy unsatisfied by everything in the world
