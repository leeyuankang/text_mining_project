good location walking distance to the opera house in one direction the famous cafe schwarzenberg in the other and basically in the center of things helpful staff they were very cooperative when we requested a room change my companion had a massage at the spa and gives it a good review concierge staff were excellent this property was a premiere hotel in turn of the century vienna and there are still traces of its glamorous past it was interesting to imagine what life was like back then breakfast included an interesting variety of asian arabic and western dishes
