this hotel is fantastic the rooms are huge and luxurious the staff are polite friendly and very helpful the breakfast was really good being right in the centre the hotel s location is perfect for shopping the opera mozart museum and most of the other attractions this was my first trip to vienna and i stayed nights which wasn t really long enough to do all that the city has to offer so i am planning a return trip in the spring i will definitely be staying at the ambassador again
