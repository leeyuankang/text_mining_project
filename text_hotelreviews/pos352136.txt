the hotel was old style but a beautiful building the staff were excellent and extremely courteous at all times i was amazed that one of the receptionist remembered my name the bedroom was beautifully laid out with all that was necessary for our night stay with a well stocked mini bar bathroom was very big and had a lovely design with very cooling floor breakfast wasn t included in our room rate but we did have breakfast at the hotel on a morning we were taking a early tour the breakfast was a typical buffet breakfast that is mostly available in mainland europe location could not be better in terms of being right on the doorstep of the main shopping street and next to the palace were plenty of transportation and tours were available
