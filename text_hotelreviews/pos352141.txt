hate to give the hotel a poor rating the rooms are spacious and overall decor of the hotel is very nice in classic vienna style the location is fantastic but no air cinditioning which is essential during the hot summer tourist season the staff however was very pleasant and accommodating when i decided to check out after only one night of my original night s stay o find an air conditioned hotel
