this hotel is a grand old lady well kept and somewhat majestic my room was well appointed with lovely fittings which suited the setting and the plumbing was modern the building itself is impressive and suits the architecture of vienna but the location is absolutely unbeatable all of vienna s top attractions were close by walking distance and there are lots of restaurants coffee shops and so on right there hotel staff were all very attentive friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was excellent this is a top hotel and i will be staying there again when next in vienna
