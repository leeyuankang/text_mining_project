brilliant location a hotel with a sense of history and pleasing art deco touches everywhere we had a couple of comfort rooms on the third floor overlooking pedestrianised kartnerstrasse and it was clear that everything had been thought about for the comfort of the guests the staff were unfailingly helpful and charming and all in all we loved our stay there
