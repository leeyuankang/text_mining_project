the location in the centre of town is great we walked almost everywhere but the transport network is easily accessible nearby too very warm welcome and super helpful formal but friendly staff throughout the whole hotel the hotel is beautifully decorated in a new but old style to be sympathetic to the age and history of the building surprisingly free of street noise despite the location a room on the side rather than the main pedestrian area helped with this
