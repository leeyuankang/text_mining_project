ideal for a central vienna one night stay at reasonable cost street noise here is unavoidable and was quite tolerable even on the f richgasse side early morning garbage collection noise is unfortunately something one has to live with in built up areas and the problem will exist for all viennese district hotels we breakfasted elsewhere so no comment on that useful proximity to the underground garage next to the staatsoper which is available to guests at a substantial discount no reservation possible but i have never found it completely full even during weekdays
