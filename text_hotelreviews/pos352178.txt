the position of the hotel couldn t have been better just off the main street a lot of the must see s were within minutes of the hotel the reception staff were very helpful and informative the breakfast was very good with a very wide choice of foods the room itself was very comfortable except we thought it could have been a little warmer bearing in mind the temperature outside was we would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wanted to be very central
