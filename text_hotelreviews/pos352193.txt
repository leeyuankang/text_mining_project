if you want to feel like you are in vienna then this is a great hotel it is classy old fashion excellent location great breakfast and great front desk attention everything you want to see is in a block radious opera house is one block away all i can say is i recommend it especially after staying in a bad hotel on my first night intercity hotel in vienna it was like day and night
