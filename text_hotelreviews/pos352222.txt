this is a great place to stay we stayed in the classic room for nights and then stayed in an executive room for a night at the other end of our trip to austria would highly recommend both rooms although the executive was really nice both rooms were clean staff were helpful and the hotel itself was very grand hotel is situated on the main shopping streer a short walk to the cathedral would highly recommend this hotel to anyone
