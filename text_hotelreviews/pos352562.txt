the executive room on the top floor was quite comfortable after we figured out how to work the a c the buffet breakfast was excellent with omelettes made to order and a nice assortment of choices the hotel is situated in a great location next to the pedestrian shopping area leading to the stephansdom and near the hofburg and museums we made little use of the executive lounge but it was convenient
