perfect location arrived in vienna via train and then easily transferred to the public transit system from the stephansplatz station it was an easy minute walk down a pedestrian street to the hotel we had a great home base to easily get all over the city on our days there kids were on a pull out sofa in a separate area of the room not entirely closed off but it felt like rooms the included hotel breakfast was fantastic huge selection and the food was delicious
