the location was ideal the purpose of my visit was to shop and this hotel is right in the middle of the shopping district in addition i loved that you could open the window and that it was so quiet at night even though my room faced neuermarkt platz where cars came through friendly staff great breakfast good room are just a few things that were appreciated i will come back to this hotel next time
