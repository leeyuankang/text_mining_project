location is the best thing about this hotel right in the middle of the center metro just around the corner and few minutes to other transportation means bus hop on hop off bus horse and carriage right next to stephanplatz square and minutes to the opera many shopping stores and restaurants facing the hotel the free mini bar and access to the executive lounge for the executive rooms were a good extra the staff in the breakfast room are very friendly and helpful
