excellent location but very very hard to find as the address given is not for the street where the doors open onto you must walk behind to find the entry very strange great staff overlooking the main street so easy shopping supermarket at the end of the street turn right out of the entry doors walk in the middle of the road and straight into supermarket which serves breakfast atm machines everywhere hop on bus the best option as a large distance to walk to all attractions we didn t take and missed some sights guess we will have to return hehe great truffles shop carefully wrapped them for us and we posted them home with fantastic help from the post shop about min walk from hotel they arrived in new zealand in days in excellent condition we classed them as a letter even though they were in a post cardboard box as the weight of the box was still in the letter class
