we stayed during a snowy january the room was warm and nice the hotel is clean the staff were very kind and helpful the location is great a few minutes walk from all attractions and subway minutes to st stephen s cathedral minutes to hofburg palace minutes to wiener staatsoper we would definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit vienna
