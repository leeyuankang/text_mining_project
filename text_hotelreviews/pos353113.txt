very convenient hotel you can do a pre checking online open the door with your mobile phone and the check out is automatic so basically no time lost if you re on a short trip but at the same time the staff is very helpful and nice the comfort and design of the room very pleasant the location is very convenient next the the station but in a nice street and not far from the centre i already recommended it to several friends colleagues
