the hotel schani wien is in an excellent location just a five minute walk from the central train station with a tram to the city centre right outside the front door the interior is modern and funky with an eclectic selection of seating options in the foyer a library and computing facilities a major plus was being able to leave our luggage securely in the basement lockers prior to check in and after we checked out freeing us up to really make use of all our time in the city the bed was extremely comfortable and the room brilliantly designed with ample storage for clothes suitcases etc personally we really liked the shower in the room concept you can always pull the curtain across for privacy if needed we had no issue with the lack of tea and coffee making facilities as you can buy them in the cafe downstairs and bring them up to your room likewise the lack of safe was not a problem as we knew about this in advance and had bought a padlock for our suitcase it was especially appreciated that we had clean towels every day and the overall cleanliness was superb the free wi fi was also a major plus helping us to keep our roaming data usage to a minimum
