as mentioned by other reviewers room design nice for one person or couple but not for friends sharing open shower area does have curtain for privacy while in shower but that blocks access to the toilet tram stop d outside door which is extremely handy for getting to the sites in town very close to main train station hauptbanhof and the shops therein didn t try the breakfast as it was euros which seemed pricey to me
