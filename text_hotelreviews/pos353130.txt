the first day we had an air conditioned problem the manager was contacted and he was very grateful to meet with us explained the cause and assigned another room we are glad that this problem happened in this hotel because the management was very responsive and concerned about the problem i appreciate this gesture by the manager reason i strongly recommend this hotel the location is excellent since it is located near the train station and the tram starts the run in front of the hotel in ten minutes you can be in the historic part of town that is about miles from the hotel the same tram will take you to wine gardens which are at the end of the tram run the rooms are very efficient comfortable and well designed a bonus is the breakfast after a month in europe we found this hotel has one of the best breakfasts
