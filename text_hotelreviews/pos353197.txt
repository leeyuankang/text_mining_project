i loved that the atmosphere of the hotel is open and welcoming it is inviting and one can easily talk to others on their travels the room is very well designed the bed is so comfortable breakfast is very varied and so are the meals available at the bar also the main reason i stayed at this hotel was due to the close proximity to the train station
