as we were travelling with our teenage son we thought a maisonette type room at hotel schani would be ideal for us we liked the look of the hotels quirky features on the web site and were not let down on arrival we arrived early so our room was not ready but the left luggage facility allowed us to store our bags and head straight into town the transport options are great bus and trams from the hotel entrance and hauptbahnhof station and sudtiroler underground a minute walk away there is a lot of construction taking place in the area but even with that and with trains trams and buses running past the hotel we had no problems with noise which is great for light sleepers like me the rooms are well equipped and include an nespresso coffee machine one word of warning about the maisonette room we thought the upper half would house the single bed for our son but it is the double that is up there so mum and i had to brave the steps every night and morning while the boy enjoyed the main living space but i must say i have never slept so well we enjoyed our stay at the hotel schani and would stay there again
