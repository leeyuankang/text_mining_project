really great place clean modern friendly even has usb chargers in the wall you don t even need a keycard since you can unlock you room with their mobile app the bed was great i m a very tall guy and they had very comfortable long beds a big plus the caf in the lobby is a great place for relaxation after a day of sight seeing location is very good right next to hauptbanhof there was a construction next door but the sound isolation is great we couldn t hear a thing but they offered that they can give us another room is the noise is too much the had a really nice map on one of the walls drawn in the hotels style it helped us to plan our tour
