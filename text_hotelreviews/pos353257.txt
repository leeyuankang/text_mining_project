excellent hotel just two minutes from central railway station and seconds from a tram that can get you to the center and the museums in minutes arsenal and belvedere are in a walking distance there is a supermarket with long hours nearby at the station if you need something the rooms are very comfortable and design is just beautiful it s like living in a piece of modern art there are bathrobes a hairdryer and good air conditioning in the room rather important thing for me
