the room was specious and well furnished with many electric plugs including usb the bed was amazing very comfortable breakfast was also very good with variety of fresh products location was great aside the tram and the railway station i like the fact that through the app you could book and select your room and use your telephone as door key although online check in needs an update another thing that hotel provides for free is water so simple and precious but so expensive in some countries of europe i defenetly stay again it became my favorite hotel
