i did like the location take the subway to amsterdam and the modern looking hotel room the breakfast was excellent they served cold cuts too bacon and beans coffee juices and more they had vending machine on the first floor some of the staff was very friendly and some were rude but over roll good i ask for a beer and wine when i arrived and one staff gave us that she was super friendly and helpful one staff came to assist us on the air conditioning situation he came quickly to help with air conditioning awesome the lowest temp that you can set is c in the day time you can t control the temp it does get warm in the summer and the room gets little uncomfortable the parking is tight and no parking spaces in the front when we arrived but more spaces in the back i was annoyed that they tour buses park on the side of the hotel really hard to drive and park in the back of the hotel
