the hotel is quite a distance from the centre of amsterdam however everyone speaks very good english and the trains are really easy and go straight to the centre of amsterdam it cost us for a three day ticket and we could use that anywhere in amsterdam it also included the trams so we felt it was really good value the hotel is clean and well equipped it is very modern
