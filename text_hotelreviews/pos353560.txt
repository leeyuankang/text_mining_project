very sterile sort of hotel would be good if you were staying only for business the rooms are clean however the double bed was two beds pushed together which i don t think is acceptable when you are paying for a night location is in the middle of nowhere however is only a minute walk to a metro getting into central amsterdam will take around minutes half an hour in a taxi from the airport
