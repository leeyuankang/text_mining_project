staying at ozo was good and we almost didn t find any faults the hotel interior is modern and clean and our stay generally was spot on service checked breakfast checked staffs were hospitable helpful and serviceable and above all smiling it was a pleasurable stay that we wouldn t imagine staying at any other hotel in amsterdam than hotel ozo
