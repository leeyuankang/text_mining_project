awesome receptionist we arrived a couple hours earlier than our supposed check in time thinking we would have to hang around the bar for a while however as our rooms were ready she gave us the keys which was a massive help rooms were really nice and also spotless free easy wifi i d stay here again at first i thought the location was an absolute mission from the centre but it s just a short walk to the metro or you can walk down a bit further mins and go to the next station bijlmer arena it s minutes to from airport from here
