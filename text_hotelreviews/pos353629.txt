ok first of alll this hotel is not city centre but a good min metro ride will get you to and from the city this was expected and totally fine as a veteran of amsterdam it is nice to get out of the city on checking in the receptionist was prompt and efficient getting us settled into our room the room itself was very nice with a good view of the office block opposite it s a business district folks but the stadium is a min walk the bed was a great size for the of us as were the pillows and comfy the room was quiet apart from some overexcited residents in the wee small hours enjoying themselves but it is the dam tea and coffee in the room and an awesome shower with hilarious frosted glass made for interesting fun also had a good size telly for the rainy afternoon and you ll pick up comedy central and the dinner and breakfast although slightly overpriced breakfast more than dinner was lovely with plenty to go round all in all brilliant would def stay again thanks to the staff at the hotel
