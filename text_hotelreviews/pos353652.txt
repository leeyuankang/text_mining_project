the hotel is close to the train station it s about min walk there s also a mc donald s nearby and costa there are bus stops within walking distance but i found it easier to walk to the train station the hotel was quiet i stayed there during term time so not many kids the rooms are of a decent size and they have enough lights plug sockets etc i love the bathroom it s very luxurious
