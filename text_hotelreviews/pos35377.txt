the staff at hotel eden were incredibly accommodating and friendly which is not always a given in paris and is a reason to return to hotel eden the room was clean modern comfortable and had everything we needed the decor is really welcoming and the hotel has a great relaxed atmosphere i would highly recommend it and will be staying here again on my next trip
