we booked a club room which while on its own wasn t particularly better than others was well worth the extra cost as it included breakfast which was excellent use of the club lounge which was a great benefit offering free drinks snacks afternoon tea etc all day and free enhanced wifi throughout our stay if wifi is important to you the normal cost of this was night so is well worth the club room cost the staff throughout the hotel were extremely helpful and pleasant making a huge effort to make the stay a good one the location of the hotel was perfect with central station canal cruises dam square all within minutes walk
