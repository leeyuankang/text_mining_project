the location was excellent and the concierge were helpful in pointing places that we could try visiting by asking all the right questions furthermore the porters were always ready to help when they can spot a lost guest also the hotel location was ideal to get to many of the places of interest which was great lastly around the hotel are many convenience stores and eateries if you need a quick fix for a meal or snack but mind the magic mushrooms though if you are not into it
