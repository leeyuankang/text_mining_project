was the best hotel out of our entire trip the room was so spacious and comfortable the breakfast was great just enough to get you started in the morning to go out all day an added bonus of the cocktail hour and the afternoon tea time int he lounge as well the staff themselves were simply wonderful there was one concierge that was so helpful to us while we were that it truly made the whole experience that much better since we didn t have to worry about getting tickets for tours or anything he even remembered the fact that we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday after just one mention of it they gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate that night plus a little note it was the little stuff that made us love this hotel we will not be staying anywhere else when we go back to amsterdam an added bonus is that they are right there next to everything we never had to walk too far to go somewhere
