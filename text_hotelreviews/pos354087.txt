the bed was comfortable but i asked and paid for a deluxe room but the room was extremeltly small seems a but steep for a room smaller than my bedroom the majority of the staff were lovely bar one very rude blonde guy who was on when i was checking out he shoudlnt work in a hotel if he hates his job so much apart from the noise of the surrouding streets all night and the size of the room everything else was ok
