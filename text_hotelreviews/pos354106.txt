family room was really comfortable in size they weren t able to give us adjoining rooms which was unfortunate as family next door were pretty loud beds and bathrooms also really clean and spacious location wise it was fantastic just a few minutes away from centraal station we were surprising one of the girls in our group so needed some assistance from the front desk team to co ordinate they did a fantastic job helping us execute our plan they were also incredibly kind and arranged for a bottle of champagne and card to be sent up overall i would return and recommend to a friend
