location in city centre just a short walk to dam square or if arriving leaving by train the hotel is mins away the lounge and bar area are fantastic restaurant dining was fabulous large spacious bedroom with large double comfortable bed the staff are outstanding i became ill in the late afternoon before leaving for the flight the concierge looked after me for several hours got me drinks and arranged for a car to pick me up at the appropriate time as i was not capable of doing this at the time i am so grateful to them for this as i was alone and their advise and care to me was outstanding i was really happy that i had chosen this hotel to stay in
