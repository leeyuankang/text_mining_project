i loved the location and clean spacious room even though we had to complain that we booked a club room and we got a broom cupboard to start with we were told it was our fault for booking when an international conference was on and the hotel was full they then moved us to a decent room staff very friendly except one misery a girl on reception with blondish hair and glasses
