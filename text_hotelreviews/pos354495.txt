from the moment we checked in we knew we had chosen the right hotel every single staff person made us feel welcome and the facilities were wonderful from the living room overlooking the canal to the lush and lovely garden to the comfortable and stylish room itself breakfasts were among the best we ve enjoyed in europe from fresh juices made to order coffees and pastries to generous assortments of cheese meats and granolas strongly recommend
