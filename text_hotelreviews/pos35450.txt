the hotel is in a great location only a few minutes walk from cole militaire metro and a short distance to the eiffel tower and les invalides there is a supermarket next door to the hotel which was great for buying water etc despite its location the hotel was peaceful and quiet the hotel is also in a good location for restaurants make you way to rue cler for a really enjoyable evening the hotel itself is pleasant we had two executive double rooms which were an adequate size one room was smaller than the other but had a very large bathroom the rooms were clean and comfortable breakfast was lovely everything was fresh and there was a good selection all the staff from the front desk to the cleaners were a credit to the hotel very pleasant and helpful overall we had a really lovely stay and i wouldn t hesitate in recommending this hotel or staying at it again
