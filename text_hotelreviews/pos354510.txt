we had a very nice stay at the canal house for two nights we booked the smallest room which was absolutely big enough for us very cosy and charming our bathtub and sink were part of the room as you can see on many pictures for us this was a nice little detail which we enjoyed maybe someone else would prefer more privacy though the stuff was very friendly and helpful und happy to fulfill any special request altogether for our needs and expectations the canal house was a perfect choice
