all of it if you book direct with canal house you get upgraded better room hot breakfast and a couple of other perks but we found the standard cold buffet excellent fresh juices salamis cheeses crudites and beautiful quality breads pastries and cereals of course our room had no view which was a slight disappointment but as we were out all day that didn t matter it was very well appointed and you are provided with slippers dressing gowns and very good quality bath gels lotions tip earplugs disposable razor cream toothbrush paste provided enough for a short stay lovely garden friendly and informative staff pleasant bar and pleasant eating area which looks out across the pretty garden
