i loved the location so close to so many things to see and do we took the pent house and wow was that wonderful with a grand view we loved the courtyard garden and the red cat that visited in the courtyard the lattes and included breakfast was great and everything we purchased for lunch or dinner was really tasty too they call them bites but there is a full meal in one of their bite dishes we were treated like royalty everyone was professional and personable and made you really feel welcome i can t say enough about the facility staff food and location
