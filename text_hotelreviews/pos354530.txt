a warm welcome from all the staff at this beautiful characterful property with a tranquil canal side location church bells rang out hourly throughout the night which we thought added to the character but could be irritating to some the garden at the back of the property was a lovely spot for an aperitif or a snack breakfast was excellent too the room included a coffee maker and complementary tea was delivered to your room pretty much instantly very convenient for great restaurants and the major attractions all within walking distance
