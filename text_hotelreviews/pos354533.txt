the location is perfect it is in walking distance to anne frank house dam square and central station we also walked to museums although this was a bit further there is a bus tram stop close by the staff was helpful and extremely friendly and luggage storage was very useful for before and after checkout the area was quiet and we enjoyed the garden area after a hard day touring
