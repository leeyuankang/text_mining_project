beautiful hotel in a beautiful location quite possibly the most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in staff members were wonderful so friendly and helpful we were e mailed a few days before we arrived and asked if they could arrange transfers or restaurant reservations which i was really impressed by i asked if we could be allocated a room at the back of the hotel which we were given and when we checked in we were told we had been upgraded how fabulous we will definitely be returning next year and recommending this hotel to all our friends
