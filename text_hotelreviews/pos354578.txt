the hotel is a beautiful mix of modern and old i particularly liked the use of color of blacks dark purple and light plum the main rooms are lovely with a nice small bar in the reception area and then a small lobby where you can sit and relax the garden is lovely and quite a nice aspect of the hotel incredibly friendly and helpful staff large well appointed rooms lovely breakfast served each day great location
