we stay at this hotel every time we come to paris as its location is excellent for both practical and tourist options it is close to a metro stop that is on a good line for taking you anywhere also can easily find cash machines two grocery stores next door plenty of shopping and restaurants and the eiffel tower is a minute walk the hotel has been very recently remodeled in a tasteful decor and the front desk staff is very helpful and friendly it is located on a busy street but the windows are extremely sound proof so it feels very quiet plenty of lounging space in the bar breakfast area we would get a bottle wine at the grocery store next door and relax in the lounge area and have some wine before dinner the staff was very nice to bring us wine glasses on request and even uncork it for us also recommend booking com for reservations best pricing and reservation options we have found
