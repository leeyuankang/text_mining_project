so far this is my favourite hotel in paris it well priced considering the location close to eiffel tower metro station around the corner street full of great restaurants cafe s and next to a supermarkets that closed late not mentioning room larg size hard to find in paris and wonderful stuff the most important things to me are the cleanness and safety even the bread crumbs under the chair got cleaned and the metro station and streets to the hotel at night was crowded lighted and alive
