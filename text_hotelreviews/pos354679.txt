we stayed here for our honeymoon and everything at the toren was amazing there was a bottle of moet and chandon champagne and strawberries waiting for us in our room i had also ordered flowers in our wedding colors to be placed in the room and the arrangement far surpassed any expectations i had it was gorgeous the room itself was absolutely beautiful we stayed in the garden cottage which is actually in the courtyard i loved being a little secluded and looking out the window to see the beautiful flowers in the courtyard the main building for the hotel is also stunning the bar was incredible the staff were extremely accommodating and kind one of the best hotel experiences i ve ever had
