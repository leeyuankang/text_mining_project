our first stop on our two week trip to the netherlands and it could not have been abetter place to start our explorations classic boutique hotel in a older building decked out in dark boudoir style lovely view out over the roof tops full jacuzzi in our room even always nice after a long flight comfortable furnishings but rooms are not huge which was fine special bonus the sounds of the westkirk bells on the quarter hour gentle on the summer breeze delightful
