our stay at the toren was quite possibly the best hotel experience we have ever had i travel internationally for business and pleasure often so i ve spent time in many hotels and the uniqueness of the toren stood out the staff was amazing friendly and quick to act if you needed anything the location is amazing beautiful and quiet with tons of a great restaurants in walking distance we walked everywhere nothing was longer than a minute walk if you are tired of typical chain hotels like waldorf astoria or hiltons and marriotts the toren is the perfect hotel i cannot wait to return
