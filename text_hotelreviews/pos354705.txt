the toren is in the beautiful jordaan area of amsterdam just a couple of minutes from anne frank s house making it an ideal base for exploring we stayed in the special deluxe room which was wonderful super comfy bed and the fabulous bath was just what we needed after a day traipsing around in the snow when i informed the staff that it was my partner s birthday the owners very kindly surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolates and strawberries the bar is stunning and the g and t s a must
