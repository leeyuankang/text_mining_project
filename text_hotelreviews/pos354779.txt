the staff at the hotel was super friendly and able to answer any questions we might have the location of the hotel is fantastic close to the anne frank house and the tram lines room service at night was very quick to deliver our orders given the opportunity to return to amsterdam i would stay here again or recommend it to a friend going to amsterdam
