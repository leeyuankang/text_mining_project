the staff where so very friendly interested and service minded room was tidy classy and the beds really comfortable i especially liked the option to completely turn off ventilation and instead open the window do not miss the bar i really liked the historic setting and how interesting the room has been handled with lighting and furniture i would recommend to try the many different gin tonics although you may regret that the morning after but then you may soothe yourself with the freshly pressed orange juice at the excellent breakfast also served in the lovely bar
