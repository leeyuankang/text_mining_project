the hotel is ideally located in the heart of amsterdam it provides an easy access to the main attractions in the city the anne frank museum is just steps away the city center is a min walk the rooms were appropriate for staying in the heart of amsterdam while the photos of the hotel on the web did deter us initially from making a booking in reality they do not reflect the warm coziness that we felt once we were there this was due to the truly great service we received at the hotel upon arrival the staff were very helpful in unloading the bags while our rooms were being prepared they ensured that we could enjoy your bar with the freshly brewed coffee the freshly brewed coffee was incidentally one of the best we have tasted during both days the staff at the hotel were always ready to help they never ever declined any of our requests the breakfast has just perfect our stay is characterized by superlatives and so our visit to amsterdam left us with wonderful memories
