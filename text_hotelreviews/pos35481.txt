one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at the staff during check in was professional polite and very welcoming i had booked a classic room but was given a junior suite due to hotel being fully booked you get coffee tea amenities plus coffee machine you find hermes in the bathroom and you are given a smartphone with mobile data which you can carry with you around the city this was pretty much handy when looking for public transport and points of interest the mattress was super firm i got to sleep very well here breakfast was delicous staff professional as well the elevator was super quick location is perfect ten minutes to the eiffel tower overall when you enter the hotel there is such a calm ambience spa like scent and you feel happy instantly
