the room we stayed in was absolutely exquisite and despite being so wonderfully spacious it was also extremely cosy and intimate a difficult combination to get just right each individual member of staff at the toren from reception and bar staff to housekeeping seemed to take personal pride and responsibility for ensuring our stay was absolutely perfect in every way the team spirit and quality of staff training was clearly visible the specialty gin cocktails in the opulent bar were quite simply to die for and the breakfast was outstanding the fabulous decor and attention to detail in this hotel is totally sumptuous overall we left feeling we had been truly and utterly spoilt we will certainly be returning
