the location is really great walk to pretty much anything the quaint bar is nice to have late night cocktails bartenders are awesome rooms are on the small side but everything you need is right there toiletries are great be careful walking up and down the stairs as they are narrow and wind around so if you are not paying attention or had too many cocktails cannot say anything about the breakfast as we would head out and grab something on the go but it looked good also we had rooms one with a canal view and one without we slept with the windows open curtains drawn but you can hear the street noise below just a factor of being in a good location the other room without the view was very quiet beds were very comfortable
