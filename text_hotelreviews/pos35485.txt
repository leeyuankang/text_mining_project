location close to eiffel tower very handy so many restaurants close by to choose from ecole militaire metro station is within a couple of minutes walk making getting around very easy very nice breakfast mainly continental but with a couple of nice hot dishes too the room itself is huge by paris standards and very nicely appointed and if your room faces the road you have a glimpse of the tower itself all staff reception breakfast housekeeping etc extremely friendly and welcoming
