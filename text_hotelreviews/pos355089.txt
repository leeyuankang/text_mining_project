the dylan is centrally located in the heart of the canal district which was a priority for us it is also an easy minute walk to the theater and museum districts which was also a plus our room was very well appointed and the staff stayed on top of restocking what ever we used throughout our stay in an expeditious manner the common areas reception living room bar and restrooms were always very clean and inviting we have enjoyed many properties in the city center of amsterdam during our stays and will definitely return to the dyan on our next visit to amsterdam
