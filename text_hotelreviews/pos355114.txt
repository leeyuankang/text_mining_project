the staff were all lovely well trained and friendly without overdoing it the location is good and allows easy access on foot to all that amsterdam has to offer the hotel itself is a beautiful building and its layout adds interest to the visitor as there always seems to be another room to discover we were upgraded upon arrival and our room was really very nice i thoroughly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again
