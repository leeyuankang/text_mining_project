spectacular hotel with excellent service the staff was attentive friendly not sure where to eat just ask their suggestions were spot on perfect location on a quieter street that is mainly residential but there are restaurants and shops within easy walking distance it s less than a minute walk to the center of town we stayed in room which overlooked the courtyard it was very spacious for a european hotel room we will definitely be back
