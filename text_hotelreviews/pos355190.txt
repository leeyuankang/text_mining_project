a perfect location for st pancras and king s cross station only about yards from the hotel doors to the eurostar check in and even closer to king s cross the fact that the hotel is not immediately next to the main road means that the rooms are nice and quiet with no noise at all heard from the lively bar on the ground floor and the quieter cocktail bar on the first floor we had a couchette room which although compact is fitted out to a very high standard and perfect for an overnight stay before onward travel by eurostar a particularly nice touch was a pantry at the end of each floor with a further selection of complementary drinks confectionery and cakes
