my stay at gnh was nothing short of fantastic beautiful and well appointed rooms extra sound proofing of the windows made for a quiet and restful sleep staff from the reception to the bar was friendly and accommodating star service and as a solo female traveler the security access to hallways where rooms are located required a key was much appreciated
