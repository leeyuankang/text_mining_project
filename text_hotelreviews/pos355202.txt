the bed was enormous and very comfortable the high tech desk was fun with charging points and switches for electric curtains and blinds i played for ages immaculately clean extremely friendly staff at reception and in the bars my luggage was whisked away and carried up for me as a matter of course the bathroom was stylish and well appointed with a powerful shower and rapid hot water if i d been staying longer i might have found the wardrobe space a bit sparse but there were the usual extras for a room at this price safe minibar etc a shared pantry with delicious complementary cake biscuits sweets and tea and coffee making facilities there were also two computer stations which i didn t need as free wifi was excellent the biggest advantage and my principal reason for staying here was of course that you can hop onto the eurostar in the morning with the minimum of fuss
