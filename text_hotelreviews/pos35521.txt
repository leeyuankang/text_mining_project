the shower was wonderful especially since it was so hot in paris when i was there the bed is completely comfortable though the room for one person is a bit small or it could have been organized slightly differently so as not to bump into the desk chair almost every time i walked past it the staff is wonderful helpful enthusiastic the air conditioning was a real treat this time with degree weather outside the location is great i walked pretty much everywhere i wanted to go except when i needed to get to the arrt
