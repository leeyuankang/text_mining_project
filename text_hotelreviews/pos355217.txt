this is our favourite hotel in london and we stay here whenever we come to this city it s location right next to st pancras station makes it the best place to stay if you are arriving or departing on the eurostar service kings cross underground also being on the doorstep is central for all locations in the city although can be a bit of a pain if traveling from heathrow on the heathrow express as you have to come from paddington the rooms are great and the added touch of the pantry on every floor makes it very special thoroughly recommended
