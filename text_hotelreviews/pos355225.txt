the great northern hotel is in a perfect location for people traveling in to london by train since st pancras and kings cross have undergone redevelopment over the past few years the area is now full with restaurants bars and some shopping making the area busy and popular the hotel has a great bar that has a wonderful atmosphere the hotel has also created galley style kitchens pantries at the end of each corridor of bedrooms providing facilities for tea coffee daily newspapers biscuits etc which is a lovely touch
