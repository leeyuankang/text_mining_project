we stayed for one night in this hotel just outside of kings cross station the room was lovely a little small but we find this is usual for central london great shower in the bathroom there was a pantry room with complimentary cakes and tea and nespresso coffee which was amazing we also had dinner and a cocktail in the hotel restaurant which was very nice although a tad expensive overall a lovely stay
