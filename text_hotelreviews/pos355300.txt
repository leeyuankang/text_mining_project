from first entering the gnh to leaving nothing was too much trouble this hotel and the staff are faultless i had worried that being adjacent to a main road and two stations that noise would be an issue however inside the soundproofing is superb the aircon also was silent the room was immaculate as was the bathroom and we wanted for nothing i do encourage you to make use of the pantry on the floor where you can help yourself to complimentary hot drinks cakes biscuits and sweets really can t recommend this place highly enough we will definitely be returning
