the staff went to a great deal of trouble to sort out problems and offer me a room i would be happier with it is certainly very convenient for st pancras station and the eurostar terminal which is why i booked it in the first place as it is literally across the road the helpfulness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel did offset some of the problems i faced however i am not sure i would stay there again
