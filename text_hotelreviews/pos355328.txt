i was impressed with the room designed to look like a luxurious sleeping accomodation on the orient express the staff were exceedingly helpful and that included help in connecting with the net my full english breakfast was done to perfection and i was thrilled to have it served to me at my table none of this floundering about when having to find one s way around self service even the milk for my coffee was hot the location is just perfect only across the street from st pancras international if one has to get the eurostar definitely worth a return
