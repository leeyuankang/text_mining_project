our room was beautifully clean stylish and oh so quiet the food at the plum and spilt milk wonderful and the pantry with complimentary goodies a nice touch all the staff were professional yet friendly and gave my wife a complimentary voucher for a birthday cocktail location made everything so easy a little pricier than other hotels but we saved on taxi fares so all in all a far more luxurious stay for less money definately will stay here again
