when i made the reservation i mentioned we were staying at the hotel as a treat for my partner s birthday even though i had booked the standard room the hotel upgraded us to a better room with a bath this was greatly appreciated the rooms are really nice and have a homely feel about them even though our room was situated at the side of the street with a very nice view on st pancras station we could hardly hear any noise from the street the bed was very comfortable we also appreciated the free selection of films to watch the bathroom was very nice indeed and the bath tub was amazing we also enjoyed the pastries and sweets in the pantry next door and last but not least the o clock check out was also appreciated i always hate to have to hurry in the morning to get ready for a o clock check out
