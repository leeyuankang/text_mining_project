this is a stylish hotel which has recently been considerably refurbished in an excellent location both for travellers arriving in london from the north and for access to the various attractions offered by the city it is between king s cross and st pancras stations the breakfast was excellent the room very comfortable we were offered a complementary upgrade but declined it the room we had was more than adequate for a one night stay
