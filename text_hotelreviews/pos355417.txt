the hotel is in a great location and despite being in a station it is surprisingly quiet very handy for the tube rail or taxi and right by lots of places for food or essential item shopping as kings cross and st pancras are lovely iconic stations now rooms are clean and the pantry on each floor is well stocked and a great idea the bar is good with great cocktails and nice atmosphere
