the absolute best part of this hotel was location it s located with one side attached to the king s cross station and across from st pancras with kings cross st pancras underground having as many tube lines going through it as it does we found ourselves able to get almost any where in london with usually one line and never more than additionally kings cross has plenty of places to grab a quick bite to eat before enjoying the sites although the room was not large by american standards it was spacious enough for two adults and two suitcases without us tripping over each other considering the busy location with constant traffic in the area the hotel was absolutely silent we opened the window once and were amazed at how much noise the walls and windows were able to filter out not a single siren penetrated the room of which there were plenty as i have experienced in many other city hotels our favorite feature of the hotel was the pantry on each floor this had a nespresso machine and tea kettle and was always kept clean and well stocked with coffee pods enough styles for everyone s tastes tea and a few tasty sweets pastry which was pleasant to start and end the day with the first floor also had a computing center with very easy to use wireless printers we sent something to print from our laptop in the floor room and were pleased to find it waiting for us as we left the hotel and on the laptop subject the wifi was very reliable and faster even than what we have at home
