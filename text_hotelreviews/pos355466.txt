room was extremely clean at all times and very well kept facilities overall location was perfect on all major tube lines close to train station slight mix up with rooms and the staff followed through on an upgrade at no additional cost for our second room to compensate from a customer service perspective nice touch with the complementary water in the room mini bar and the pantry goodies on every floor
