the location was perfect for us very close for our visit to the royal naval college for a concert really near to the thames and only about minutes from the dlr station too lots of places to go out and eat and the thames is nearby too for a nice walk the hotel itself was a really outstanding building from the outside and the room was a decent size too and had everything we needed for our stay the staff were friendly and the breakfast was well stocked with plenty of variety and good service
