location was very convenient for our night at the arena just a ten minute taxi ride away lovely staff very helpful and friendly even sorted us out some biscuits and hot chocolate when we returned late and just missed the complementary drinks snacks which were a nice touch they do put them away over night had a lovely walk around greenwich park the following morning which is just a stone s throw from the hotel
