beds where really comfy and enjoyed a good nights sleep hair dryer iron etc was all available the only down side was the bathroom which could use a serious update black mold everywhere which gave it a very unclean feeling the staff where lovely and very helpful despite the bathroom i would use this hotel again as the location is superb and you are so close to so many things plenty to do and visit
