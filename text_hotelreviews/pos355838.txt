the hotel is a beautiful historic building with many photographs and pictures explaining its original use the interior and the bathrooms are a little tired but the staff cleanliness and general ambience make up for that two fold couldn t have wished for a better location to stay in greenwich minutes from the park and observatory and minutes to the pier and shops highly recommended
