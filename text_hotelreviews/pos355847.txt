the room was an alcove room on the top floor meaning the window was a dormer type so when you went to the bathroom if you weren t careful you d bang you head on the edge of the alcove only other disappointment was the height of the bed my partner is only short and the bed was very high off the floor meaning that it was awkward getting in
