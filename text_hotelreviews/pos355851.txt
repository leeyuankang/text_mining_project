the hotel was easy to find and welcoming the room was clean and tidy but a little tired with the lampshades looking a bit worn but everything you needed was there and the beds were very comfortable breakfast was plentiful and pleasant and with an o clock check out breakfast didn t feel rushed we used the mbna clipper service from cutty sark to get in and out of the center of london and it worked really well as we had wonderful weather
