the sat nav said we were there before we were but once we found it it suited our needs very well the staff were extremely helpful food was good and the whole area is very pleasant with lots of greenery around relatively easy acces into london by the dlr or riverboat we have stayed in central london previously but this was convenient coming down by road from norfolk and out of the hustle and bustle of the city we ll definitely stay there again and a pub just down the road for a good meal
