central location in greenwich with car parking at per day which was good for london beautiful grounds and plenty of places to eat and drink in the area plenty of choice for breakfast and tasty sausages we were visiting excel and it was easy to get to would definitely stay here again used the river taxis to get to central london a more relaxed trip than the underground love greenwich
