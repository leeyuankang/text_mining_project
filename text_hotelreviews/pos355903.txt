loved the beautiful spotless room overlooking the grounds to the front really comfy bed it was an effort to get up for breakfast but having stayed there before we knew how good the breakfast is and didn t want to miss that always stay here when we are going to the and like to travel to the by the river boat which is a minute walk away relaxing clean hotel with really friendly staff
