great location in greenwich and short walk from cutty sark dlr station asked for a quiet twin on the top floor and got a large corner room on the top floor at end of several halls did not mind the distance from the lift as large rectangle building since room dimensions were generous ironically there were others in that hallway as one could hear voices through the room doors but luckily this old building has thick walls so once in the room it seemed ok also great that windows actually could be opened
