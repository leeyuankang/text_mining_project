i spoke to three or four different staff at the reception during our stay but all of them were really very friendly we asked some questions about a vip pass to versailles the hotel sells at the reception and the staff didn t know the answer but we weren t too disappointed about that because he really tried to help us also we lost hot water for few hours one night but we could see the staff again was really trying to help and it was fixed the next morning as he promised customer service was just excellent at this hotel
