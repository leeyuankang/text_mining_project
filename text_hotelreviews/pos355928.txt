we loved the location for us it was perfect the rooms were comfortable not massive but fine for our requirements the gardens are a bonus especially for the little one to run around safely there is a very useful business suite with computers and tea coffee available on tap the hotel is next door to the maritime museum and a few minutes from the cutty sark if you like history then this is the place to stay the underground is just a short walk not clearly signposted there are the ferry boats and river cruises a stones throw away you can use oyster cards on the trains busses and some ferries the is just miles up the road so a thumbs up
