what a lovely hotel it only took us about minutes to walk to the eiffel tower and was so centrally located the staff spoke perfect english and were so kind and courteous we were on the top floor with a beautiful view of the eiffel tower from our balcony our room was very clean comfortable and everything was up to date and modern i would absolutely love to stay at this hotel again when we return to paris a
