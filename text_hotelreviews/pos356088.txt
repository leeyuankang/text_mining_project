the bed was very comfortable the bar stayed open late so we were able to have a nightcap with other friends staying in the hotel after an evening out the floor bedroom was different as it had a bed area and then a separate space where there was a desk dressingtable almost like rooms but both quite small perfectly adequate for overnight stays absolutely stunning location and attractive building
