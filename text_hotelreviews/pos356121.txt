we were visiting for our second visit and last time travelled as a family with children this time we were there for the london marathon and were impressed that they had gone out of their way to accommodate the runners with extras in the room and a special menu laid on there are lots of pubs shops and restaurants within walking distance and very close to the tube station views from the park are amazing very happy with our stay and will be visiting again reasonably priced accommodation
