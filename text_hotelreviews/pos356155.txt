lovely grand building in central greenwich not beside a main road so not much noise at night rooms vary in size but generally bigger than you d find in central london with spacious bathrooms the breakfast buffet is extensive and the staff are very friendly and helpful prices can be really good when the hotel is quiet close to dlr and overground trains so a great alternative to staying in the centre of london
