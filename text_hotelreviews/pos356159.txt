location superb and my favourite in london so far and great to be near the market park waterside etc we had a reasonable view but not the best in the hotel access to transport excellent historic elegant buildings class architectural heritage all round lots to see for visitors hotel facilities we used were good rooms are good comfortable size and well appointed generally all rooms have en suite i guess staff pleasant friendly willing and accommodating breakfasts great car parking really good would recommend hotel
