amazing old building in the centre of greenwich gardens and courtyards around mean that external noise is minimal the rooms are large and comfortable the staff very helpful and the breakfast has a wide choice with london bridge station only minutes on the train and the dlr stop close to the hotel this is a great value alternative to staying in central london
