great hotel if you want a value for money greenwich was a park like area with lots of restaurants really liked taking the ferry on the thames into london pounds each way but quite lovely also a bus tube option is available best to take the outer beltway tort there as we encountered the congestion tax enjoyed cutty sark museum too
