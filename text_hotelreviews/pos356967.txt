very nice hotel the location was excellent for me as i was primarily interested in touring the museums it was quiet but very close to the museum quartier tour bus stops and the metro the bathroom was clean and spacious the bed and pillows were comfortable breakfast was served buffet style with a nice selection of items the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable
