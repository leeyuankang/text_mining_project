my stay at the hotel maria theresia was very pleasant the place provided everything i prefer neither big nor small no embarrassingly posh decoration very comfortable and clean two elevators special thanks to the personnel for their friendliness and the wonderful atmosphere my room on the first floor was spaceous and full of light which was really important as i had to work till late the breakfast was superb the metro the main shopping street and one of the few spar supermarkets open even on sundays are within an easy walking distance
