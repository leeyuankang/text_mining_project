the room was spacious with a low dividing wall between our bed and our young daughter s the separate toilet and luggage rooms were an unexpected bonus the free wifi was excellent and was actually free throughout the stay the included breakfast was generous and of good quality we were allowed a late checkout and as our flight out of vienna wasn t till late that night it was very generous of them to offer us the use of the showers in their wellness room gym facility at the end of a warm afternoon out
