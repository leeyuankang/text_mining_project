staff are very friendly and nice especially the lady at the breakfast reception welcoming us on tuesday friday and the cleaning lady of our room during our stay these persons are really excellent and i would like to thank them especially the cleaning lady of room i appreciate alot for her small gesture of thoughtful way of arranging things such as let the dishwashing sponge dry which i used to wash milk bottles everyday i put a small box of chocolate at the reception for her when we checked out hope she got it our room was big enough to put a baby cot next to our bed it was spacious overall we had an excellent stay there
