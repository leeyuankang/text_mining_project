perfect stay great breakfast well located attentive staff no problem was too big or too small for the hotel staff to resolve while other hotels are closer to the heart of vienna nothing beats the cost value and the quality of the service provided plus the hotel is right next to some of the biggest museums in the city plus the hofburg palace is just a short walk away i have stayed in many hotels in vienna in the last years and this one is my favorite by far
