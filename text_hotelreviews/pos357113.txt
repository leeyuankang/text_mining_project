i really liked the comfort of the bed and general conditions of the hotel the staff was very polite and attentive location although not in the very center of the city but gives you a chance of a very pleasant minutes walk to the main attractions the barman vladimir was very polite to serve me minutes past midnight although he was closed already breakfast was not bad either
