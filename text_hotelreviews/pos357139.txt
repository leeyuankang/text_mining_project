the room is a lovely boutique design we had a quiet room with a view over vienna s roof tops breakfast was great and the staff really helpful they went out of their way to assist the location is just perfect we had been to austria before but never to vienna this city is amazingly beautiful and clean and the viennese are incredibly helpful and generous with their time we will return both to the city and to this hotel
