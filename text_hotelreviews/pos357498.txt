the breakfast was amazing i looked forward to it each day also the location was outstanding close enough to major sites of interest to walk but in a neighborhood with a lot of artsy and interesting shops lively little restaurants a beautiful old church just around the corner with view from our window our room was very comfortable and also beautiful the hotel is in an historic building and the decor is in keeping with that yet it s completely up to date and somehow felt modern also loved the malin goetz products in the bathrooms we needed to make a change in our plans to add nights to our original booking of nights extended to and were really glad we did
