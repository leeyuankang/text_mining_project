every time i stay here i m quite impressed by friendly and personal touch of services offered it has not changed since my first stay for more than years ago and despite changes of personnel you can feel every staff does enjoy working for the hotel and guests truly amazing the breakfast rooms were temporarily located on the ground level until the end of march due to renovation having buffet breakfast at altstadt vienna is definitely one of many reasons why i keep coming back to this beautiful city its comfortable and relaxing atmosphere great variety of tea leaves i prefer tea to coffee for breakfast bread jams and cold cuts always made me late for setting out to the day s first destination this time i particularly enjoyed pear juice in the late afternoon you can enjoy delicious cake and tea at the same place at least i had five different homemade cakes during my stay and they were all really tasty speaking of the rooms i stayed at one of jr suite which is month old after renovation and one classic double room i loved its high ceiling warm colours of curtains and cushions contrasting bright blue sofa of the jr suite from the past experiences i was a bit skeptic about waterproof function of glass door of the separate shower booth but it was needless fear one might feel uncomfortable as the outside of closet and bathroom doors are all covered with mirrors you can look away though in a classic double room a large painting was hung on the wall it was a nice change from a colourful interior to a subdued one it is as comfortable as in your own room yet with much more sophistication that s what i really love about this hotel i d really love to get back there like yesterday
