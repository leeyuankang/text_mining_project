absolutely wonderful hotel we were there for our honeymoon but right from the moment we stepped into reception before they d even established who we were we were made to feel special the room was incredible and the breakfasts were excellent with different special dishes cooked to order every day and a huge array of breads meats cheeses and cereals to choose from the cake and tea available every afternoon was the icing on top if you ll forgive the pun
