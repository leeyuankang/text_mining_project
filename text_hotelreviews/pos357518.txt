really comfortable rooms immaculately kept the staff went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible as we were on our honeymoon we had complimentary drinks a polaroid taken for us to keep a congratulatory card in the room taxis restaurants anything we needed was booked for us the location was walking distance to all the main attractions yet had a really local non tourist feel to it everything was so relaxed and comfortable we felt like we were amongst friends the breakfast was amazing with carefully selected ingredients there was a choice of a different local menu each day as well as a continental breakfast and prosecco and of course tea coffee and juices in the afternoon there was free tea and cake in the salon by far the best hotel breakfast offered we will definitely be returning one day
