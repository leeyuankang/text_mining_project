we were friends in the xl suite a bed apartment style room with large lounge very comfortable and spacious staff were absolutely brilliant in every respect breakfasts were great and it is only a min stroll to the hofburg it s in a nice area with a variety of different and unusual shops and restaurants i cannot recommend the altstadt highly enough
