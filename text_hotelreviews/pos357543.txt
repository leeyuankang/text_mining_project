the location is close to the centre without being in the centre the five minute stroll to the museum quarter is very pleasant and the route can be varied each time external appearances are not impressive but wait until you go up to the reception on the first floor and then wow without exception all the staff are so friendly polite and helpful my room was listed as a business single so i was surprised by how spacious it was with a king size bed the unique design of the room was total luxury and comfort i could not fault it breakfast was everything that i had read in other reviews superb choice and beautiful surroundings with tables in three separate rooms all with original art on the walls if you return from sightseeing in time for free tea and cake it is a very civilised way to wind down after a day in the city there are several restaurants in easy walking distance from the hotel public transport in vienna is so easy to use as the trams buses and metro all run frequently and you never have long to wait i bought the weekly ticket which was bizarrely cheaper than the day ticket and could be used on all modes of transport except the sightseeing buses this was one of the best city breaks i have ever had
