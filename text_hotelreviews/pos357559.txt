included breakfast free afternoon tea was very good we stayed in a basic room which was fairly plain not as nice as the more expensive rooms pictured room size was good hotel location requires a min walk to main things like vienna state opera etc but our room was very quiet hotel restaurant recommendations were very good and a short walk away hotel staff very friendly helpful with good english
