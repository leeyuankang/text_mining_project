i loved my stay at the altstadt rarely do i feel impressed enough to write a review but the staff at the hotel altstaft deserve every bit of praise always smiling and cheerful knowledgable about anything and everything and ready to help the complimentary afternoon tea salons enhance the fin de si cle feel of the place originally apartment buildings the rooms are tastefully decorated with luxury amenities reliable wifi and welcoming breakfast it s hard to fault the hotel altstadt
