this is a lovely hotel in an old viennese building the room was very comfortable with an excellent bed the staff were very friendly in a genuine way and incredibly helpful the breakfast was the best i have had in a hotel it was well thought out so that you could have a very healthy breakfast if you wanted the manager of the hotel always came through to say hello and was not beyond removing a used dish from the table the afternoon tea was perfect with a wide variety of teas and home made cake
