i loved the quirky contemporary d cor but also the fact that the hotel was very comfortable the communal salon and adjoining rooms were a delight the service was excellent very helpful and friendly staff and the breakfasts were superb i also liked the fact you could always help yourself to a hot drink and fruit oh and the bathroom toiletries were an unexpected treat it was a clever idea to have them for sale too so you could relive the fine bathing experience at home
