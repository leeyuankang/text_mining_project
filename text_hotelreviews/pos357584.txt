this is a lovely hotel all the staff are very friendly we were warmly greeted and shown to our room which was delightful nothing was too much trouble for the staff the breakfast was superb with an added bonus of home made cake and tea available in the lounge from the decor and art works around the hotel really does add a touch of class and its only minutes walk from the museum quarter in a quiet side street i we go to vienna again we would not hesitate to stay at the altstadt
