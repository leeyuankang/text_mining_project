funky fun hotel with great art decorated rooms in a gentrifying area of the city mid way between the old city and the conference centre i had to get to most days but close to a major metro and train station so getting about was very easy great range of food for breakfast and really friendly and attentive staff in a less touristy part of the city so we saw a bit more of the gritty side of vienna no bad thing at all
