we had a lovely day stay at der wihelmshof check in was a little slow and they charged us euros for an early check in extra money for a few hours early check in is a strange concept for us but maybe that how things work in this part of the world the reception is small dark and could use a warmer facelift the staff are all very helpful and smart the room was a pleasant surprise spacious enough and clean immaculate linens and very comfortable beds the bathroom was big contemporary and extremely convenient stocked with generous portions of the shampoo body wash and lotion i am a cleanliness freak and couldn t find one thing i could fault having travelled mostly in asia and americas it always surprises me when not even one complimentary bottle of water is provided in the hotel but again that s just europe i suppose breakfast was average nothing great really eaten better breakfast buffets could use more variety and hot options walking distance from the main metro station easy access via metro to all attractions
