so the property was very nice from the breakfast bar which was extensive to the staff that could not be more helpful there was no bad at this hotel the location was nice near one of the main train stations taxi stands restaurants and was minutes to down town and minutes to the airport the beds were overwhelmingly comfortable and relaxing i particularly liked the funky art work and style and a top notch bar and patio that stays open late on site wasn t a bad thing either overall i thought the price of the hotel was an incredible deal for vienna and highly recommend it to anyone looking for comfortable accommodations
