nice hotel it is not fully renovated and you can see this from carpets in the rooms and old elevator nice lobby small one and nice breakfast but with short of staff some staff very friendly and some other specifically one lady in the breakfast almost rude in order to go to the city centre you need underground that it is not preferable in general i am satisfy if i go again i will book a hotel closer to the centre walking distance
