very comfortable big and quiet room for the three of us for a change the folding extra bed is huge not the usual tiny couch we are used to and even when it is open there is a large space in the room very nice own branded toiletries great breakfast the hotel s own branded jams are fascinating we especially liked the raspberry one yummy if you like them you can even buy some and take it home with you location is very convenient just around the corners you find u bahn stations and the prater is in a very comfortable walking distance extra nice staff feels like home
