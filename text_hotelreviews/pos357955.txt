the staff s quality of the english language was amazing they really went out of their way to help us with tourist information and spent minutes explaining lots of useful things even though there was a queue waiting to check in we thought this was really lovely everybody from the cleaning staff to the hotel desk staff were lovely to us and made our stay even more enjoyable
