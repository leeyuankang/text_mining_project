the location was excellent only a few stops with the tram number to the center of amsterdam the staff was very friendly the room comfortable and cosy we haven t enjoy the bathroom no personal space and we hadn t not a vue of any kind from our windows only cigarettes furthermore our rooms was in the basement and the absence of the elevetors or a bell boy was not a positive element especially with our baggages
