nice friendly hotel in a great location in the prosperous west side of the city tram route stops right outside the door and goes right into town and up to the central station tram travel is cheap into town esp if you buy rover style tickets by the day s the hotel also does reasonable bike hire too and the city centre is a min leisurely cycle through the park staff helpful rooms comfortable bar okay didn t choose to eat there so can t comment on the food we will definitely stay there again
