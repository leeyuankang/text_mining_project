we were a two minute walk left of the hotel front door from a side entrance into vondelpark right into the heart of it which was bustling full of people who were running roller blading out for walk and cycling of course it was the first morning we traveled into the park to have breakfast on the edge of the water the hotel itself had a stylish contemporary reception with hanging egg chairs that were very comfortable and relaxing just down to the right of the hotel entrance was a tram stop for two different trams to bring us toward the city centre
