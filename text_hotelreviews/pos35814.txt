the proximity to the gloucester road tube station was excellent we used the gatwick express to get from the airport to victoria station from the hotel we walked to harrods and then to kensington high street in the other direction there were lots of attractions restaurants bars within walking distance too even though the hotel was fully booked it was so quiet there were a few other people in the bar when we arrived back at teatime for our free prosecco but we really didn t see anyone until breakfast continental breakfast was really fresh with a great variety and good coffee you can order a hot breakfast if you want and pay a bit extra we requested a late check out and this was extended to pm which was fantastic as we had to get dressed to attend the queen s garden party i would absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to go back
