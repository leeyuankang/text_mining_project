the hotel was in a brilliant location only a few tram stops away from the centre however it felt like it was a million miles away it was so peaceful the park behind the hotel was beautiful would recommend a walk around it the room and hotel was very clean brilliant facilities very comfortable big bed bath was perfect size and very comfy close to a nice little italian and also close to a supermarket cannot stress how brilliant the hotel was and how welcomed we felt
