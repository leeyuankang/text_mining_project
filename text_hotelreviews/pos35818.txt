our third stay at this hotel appreciate the price compared to other london properties short walk from gloucester road tube station although refurnished in showing some signs of age continental breakfast good although those staying for any length of time will find it repetitive a c wifi tv all worked well moderate noise from subway line which is below ground but open across the street but window glass does good job of mitigating and we haven t found it to be an issue those who are noise sensitive should ask for a room away from cromwell road haven t noticed any room to room noise transmission on any of our stays good location for double decker bus to downtown if you re planning to use buses highly recommend downloading citymapper s summary of the most frequently used downtown bus lines very useful great array of highly ranked trip advisor restaurants within ten minute walking distance but note that reserving is becoming more necessary due to the popularity of the ta website we found this to be the case throughout europe
