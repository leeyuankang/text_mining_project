staff really friendly originally in the superior room but after going in and seeing that it was just beds pushed together we asked to upgrade to the whirlpool room which was amazing it was deffinatly worthing paying a little bit more for such a difference bed was amazingly comfy and so was the whirl pool perfect after going walking around and going in the coffee shops all day
