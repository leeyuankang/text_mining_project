while this hotel is showing its age even though it was refurbished in it s a reasonable choice for a stay in london close to the tube on direct line from heathrow close to several major museums with any number of restaurants within easy walking distance breakfast was more than adequate and although it s hardly necessary they do provide the option of a full english breakfast for a surcharge a c works fairly well wifi strong tv good staff helpful and friendly this was our second stay here and we ll be back again space available
