extremely nice staff very smart design of the room and the hotel spacious shower big fluffy towels and comfy slippers excellent pillows with an additional choice of pillows a la carte finally perfect night sleep conditions fantastic location our room window was facing a kind of church so no neighbors to peek into the room don t count much on the pool though it s very tiny but still the roof top terrace was a nice place to look at the city read a book and enjoy the sun overall we had a wonderful stay
