beautiful hotel in a fantastic location and the friendliest most helpful staff the beds were very comfortable with immaculate bedding the concierge was always smiling and ready to help we didn t eat in the hotel as there were so many restaurants we wanted to visit we were very pleased with our choice and would definitely stay again when back in barcelona
