i enjoyed how warm and helpful the staff was the building is perfect and the beds were the most comfortable beds i stayed in my entire trip the rooms are definitely soundproofed which helps when you are on las rambla i ve stayed at several other hotels over the years off las rambla and they have always been noisy i m hotel baques was so quiet and the blackening curtains helped us sleep in we even had a small balcony that we could look out on
