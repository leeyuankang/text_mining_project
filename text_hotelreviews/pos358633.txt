the rooms were lovely the staff were very nice and amanda on reception was amazing answered all my questions and booked everything for me on the spot the roof top terrace is a gem with a fantastic vibe and lovely views didn t have time to try out the pool but it looks inviting food not that great on the rooftop terrace but i still had a wonderful time up there on occasions in days i had a room overlooking las ramblas there aren t many it s not that noisy but there s also not much to see either because of the trees the hotel has plenty of other rooms looking over less noisier streets which may be cheaper if you want decadence there are penthouses with private pools for around nite and they are amazing
