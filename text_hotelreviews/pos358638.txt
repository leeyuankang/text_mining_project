wonderful three days we especially enjoyed the roof top terrace for drinks and tapas with the amazing views the hotel is right on la ramblas so within walking distance to all the shops and many museums the staff were very friendly and courteous and went out of their way to make our stay special the bed was so comfortable and the marbled bathroom well equipped for lovely long soak after walking for miles the breakfast had was good a large selection on the buffet although the small bowl for the scrambled eggs freshly cooked kept running out but saying that at least it wasn t the rubbery stuff kept warm for hours you see in most breakfast buffets excellent hotel a bit pricey but there again you do get what you pay for
