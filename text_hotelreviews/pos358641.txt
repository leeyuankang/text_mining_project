staff was excellent location was fabulous really enjoyed our stay hotel is one of the best hotels we ve ever stayed at they are at the top end of la ramblas you can walk down the pedestrian thoroughfare to the beach or go north to the beginning of the more modern areas in barcelona we had a wonderful visit to the city we didn t even have a chance to enjoy the rooftop area that overlooks the entire city we lingered there for a few minutes one morning really enjoyed the views
