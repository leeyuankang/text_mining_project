perfect location incredibly comfortable it felt like home staff was so friendly and were helpful in every way they actually talk to you like family instead of a tourist we celebrated my friends birthday they sent a bottle of bubbly she felt so special i can t wait to come back and stay here again we were here for days and it s not enough time to experience all that barcelona has to offer
