excellent location walking distance to the port and other attractions hotel was modern and contemporary the roof top terrace has excellent views of barcelona and was our place to go after a long day blankets were provided when it got colder along with heaters the spa was very relaxing and tranquil the gym was small but adequate for a quick workout would recommend this hotel to friends and family
