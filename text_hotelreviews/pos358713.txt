the lobby area was quite large the elevators were decent sized for people and luggage the bed was large and comfortable and many attractions are within walking distance the hotel itself is very nice our room was ready early which was fabulous after hours of flying they had already acknowledged that i requested early check in and advised they would be able to hold our bags if a room wasn t available there is a nice pool and bar on the roof top
