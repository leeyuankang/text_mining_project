the hotel is perfectly located at the top end of las ramblas within a few minues walk of both the gothic quarter and placa catalunya the hotel is very tastefully decorated throughout quite dark and atmospheric with lovely large sofas in the lounge areas we requested a room on the floor just to avoid any potential noise from las ramblas we were impressed with the cleanliness and hygiene standards throughout the hotel we particularly appreciated the huge bed and it was so nice to walk into a bedroom with a clean shiny solid floor no carpets or rugs gathering dirt our crisp white sheets and pillowcases were changed every day not an old bedspread in sight the hotel has a small heated pool on the roof and a large well run roof top bar which was a very peaceful place to relax with a nightcap or two at the end of the day brilliant we really couldn t fault the staff who were always extremely polite and professional would definitely recommend this hotel
