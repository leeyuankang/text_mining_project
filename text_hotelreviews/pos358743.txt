decor is very inviting and we loved the location while the staff was helpful we often got overly optimistic estimates of how long it might take to get somewhere air conditioning does not operate until may very warm in room at night but overall would definitely recommend this hotel lovely breakfast and afternoon tea time with snacks which are all included
