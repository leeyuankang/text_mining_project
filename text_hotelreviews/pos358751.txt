central location on la rambla easily accessed from placa catalunya la ramble can be a bit overpowering but our quiet and comfortable room was at the rear of the hotel meaning it was away from the noise and tat and had a good view over mont juic roof top pool looks great though cool weather precluded its use and the spa facilities were nice to have though the sauna steam room could have been hotter
