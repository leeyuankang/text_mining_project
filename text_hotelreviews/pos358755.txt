best part is the roof deck with heated pool and i mean heated it was like a bathtub in there so relaxing great to have drinks up on the roof relaxing in the sun after a morning of walking around and exploring the rest of the hotel is great also though rooms were very comfortable and the mini bar was well stocked front desk person gave us some nice recommendations on places to see and eat
