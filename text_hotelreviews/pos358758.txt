loved the terrace leading off from our room the bed was extra comfy a real bonus and the room was extremely clean at just the right temperature staff are always smiling and polite willing to help with literally anything the building was large and spacious with lots of room to spread out and relax around the foyer the roof top pool bar and seating relaxing area is very very nice if it is not nice weather the indoor pool and facilities are great
