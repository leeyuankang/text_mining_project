the hotel was very trendy and in a brilliant location we loved everything about our stay especially how friendly the staff were i wrote a small note on the booking form to tell them it was our honeymoon and they had a bottle of champagne ready for our arrival not to mention the free room upgrade fantastic hotel with amazing staff and facilities i m certainly going to come back
