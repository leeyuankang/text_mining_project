excellent location right on the rambla and a couple of blocks from plaza de catalunya street noise wasn t an issue but our room wasn t facing the rambla so ymmv nicely decorated room w hardwood floors and large plush towels the turn down service didn t just leave a mint on the pillow they replaced used towels and tidied up a bit nice rooftop lounge bar w an unobstructed view of the waterfront although spa access was included we were too busy to check it out
