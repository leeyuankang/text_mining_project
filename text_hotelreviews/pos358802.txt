i definitely liked this hotel and will recommend it to everyone who wants to combine a city break with relaxation and pampering although the treatments in the spa were not the best i have had in a hotel spa in was still relaxing as well as the pool and sundeck on the roof the staff was very helpful and friendly but the cleaning of the room was not always timely and they forgot to fill the minibar but all that was fixed immediately when i mentioned about it my overall view is that hotel is a good choice in barcelona
