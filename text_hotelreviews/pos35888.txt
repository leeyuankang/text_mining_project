very close to gloucester road tube minute walk from the hotel reception staff and concierge were very welcoming and helpful feels more like a guesthouse than a hotel which in itself is pleasant some nice touches in the room bottled water complimentary newspaper and a complimentary bath oil all in all great value for a london location
