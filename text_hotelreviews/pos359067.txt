was told that we were being given quiet area at back of hotel there was building work going on from early hours of the morning and into the evening which i know was not hotels fault but annoying still also one night we decided to dine in the restaurant waited for minutes and couldn t see anyone serving then went down to ask if restaurant was open went back to restaurant again still nobody came so left the hotel and eat somewhere else
