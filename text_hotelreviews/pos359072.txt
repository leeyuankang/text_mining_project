great location and lovely hotel we took staff members there on a surprise trip and all the staff from back end booking to check out were extremely helpful and accommodating with such a large group we all had different classes of room and even the smallest ones were well kept very clean and extremely comfortable sitting on the roof terrace in the sunshine was a definite highlight to waiting for the rest of the staff to arrive
