this is an excellent hotel we were lucky to get booked in at the last minute we had had a disappointing experience with the previous booking at another location our experience at this hotel thoroughly made up for the problems we had experienced although this hotel cost a little more than we are used to paying it was a revelation to see what could be done the size of the rooms the decor and the facilities were absolutely superb the staff were polite pleasant and helpful a really great experience
