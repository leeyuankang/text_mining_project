it was an ok hotel in a very good location if you want to stay somewhere in the middle of the action then this is the place to be at the beginning of la rambla just a short walk from the bus stops the hotel is not horrible i personally think the room we stayed in could do with a bit of updating compared to the price we paid in this case it seems that you pay for location
