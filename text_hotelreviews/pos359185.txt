i and my husband and my daughter stayed at the hotel from march to april when we arrived at night we have shocked when we see our room because it was very small and not suitable for us as a family with many luggage but the next day we talked to mr carlos nogueira who is very cooperative smart and friendly he has changed our room to another one that was more comfortable and overlooking the street the location of the hotel is more than perfect you are in the middle of ramblas street the most famous street in barcelona and all the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly the only disadvantages is the internet connection it was bad and disconnected a lot and the lift is very small
