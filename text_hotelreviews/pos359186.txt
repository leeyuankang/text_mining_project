location was right at las ramblas which was excellent many places to eat close by very close to placa catalunya reception staff were friendly and courteous after two nights in a room at the back with little light on request they transferred us to a room facing las ramblas for the remaining two nights this was good and there was not much noise from the street up on our fourth floor front room
