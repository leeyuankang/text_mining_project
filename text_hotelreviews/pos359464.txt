the breakfast was fantastic beautifully cooked pastries plenty of choice the room was spacious with everything you could need the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in and despite being on the main street it was so quiet and cool also the staff were alwsys on hand to help out i would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in barcelona
