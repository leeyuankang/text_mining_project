friendly staff very comfortable bed the location for the sse arena could not have been nearer the breakfast was cooked nicely and there was copious selection and the staff in the restaurant area were lovely and very attentive we did not want for anything good to see also that we were checked by security on entering the hotel after we had been to the concert therefore we felt safer that only hotel guests were able to enter
