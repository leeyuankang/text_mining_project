buffet breakfast is always exciting at any hilton i ve stayed at and it was no different here staff were very attentive at breakfast i was offered a coffee refil three times and orange juice brought to my table plates were promptly swept away just as i d finished using them food was excellent tasty and good quality think every member of staff i walked past greeted me with good morning couldn t ask for a better location to visit wembley stadium parking was as guest otherwise view from sky bar over wembley was brilliant a pint in the bar plus service so not cheap but ok as a one off treat
