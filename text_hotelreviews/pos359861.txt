excellent breakfast buffet very good service exceptionally robust security arrangements for getting into the hotel and returning also the internal hotel security was very visible in all areas i particularly liked the two bars within the icon bar one for residents one for public food was available and was served very promptly so good planning ahead as this was a very busy time just following the cup final would definitely stay again
