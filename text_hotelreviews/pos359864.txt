my wife and myself stayed nights at this hotel we travelled to the hotel in our private vehicle and parked in the gold car park situated metres from hotel which is discounted for hotel guests our vehicle was safe and secure the hotel is conveniently located metres away from wembley stadium restaurants bars shops and public transport the hotel was very clean comfortable our king size room was clean comfortable and quiet staff were very friendly and professional we dined in the restaurant both evenings food was good breakfast was very good with plenty of choice overall we enjoyed a very relaxing night stay i would certainly recommend this hotel we will definitely return in the future
