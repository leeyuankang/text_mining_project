the staff were super friendly and very informative i checked into the m by montcalm yesterday evening and even though the room was much more expensive the staff were atrocious in comparison to the service i received at the hilton i was very impressed and they gave me all the information i would require up front breakfast was very good fantastic choice of food and all available when you book breakfast a pet peeve is when hotels charge to different prices for continental and english breakfast so the set up at the hilton was superb
