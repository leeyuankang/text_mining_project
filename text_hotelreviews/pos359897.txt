the location of the hotel and parking was perfect when visiting london to watch the rugby game at wembley and the shopping outlet and restaurants next door was brilliant we loved the room and the entrance it s was beautiful the breakfast which was included within the price was amazing along with the amazing view of wembley stadium we would stay again whenever we visit london again
