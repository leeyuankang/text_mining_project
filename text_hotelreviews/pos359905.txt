the staff are excellent every single member were polite courteous and went that extra mile to improve our stay the security were great to talk too and not intimidating at all the bar staff were always happy to help and had good sense of humors particular recognition to angelo at the sky bar who was a real pleasure to engage with and a top chap i must stress how impressive the service is here as this is the only reason i am giving a review
