the welcoming once we got to the hotel was great my son loves this hotel the hotel was busy for check in but it was to be expected as it was around but we were dealt with pretty swiftly our room was a high floor and had a stadium view hotel was spotless the staff friendly and helpful cheerful the leisure facilities are always a pleasure to use without a doubt next time im off to an event at wembley arena or wembley stadium i will be staying here again a firm favourite and cant wait till the next time
