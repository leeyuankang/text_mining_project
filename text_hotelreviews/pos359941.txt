what made me book this hotel was the fact that it has a rooftop bar a swimming pool and it s close to great retail outlets the pictures online do not do the hotel enough justice the beds were extremely comfortable haven t slept so well in ages the bathroom looked very nice although the shower temperature kept rising on and off when showering which was slightly dangerous the breakfast was great they make fresh omelettes right in front of you the swimming pool was great although we saw a couple of plasters floating around should definitely be more monitored
