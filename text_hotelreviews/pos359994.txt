the hilton london wembley was fantastic an unexpected complimentary upgrade saw us in a beautiful modern spacious room with a great view of the arena staff were all very pleasant knowledgeable and accommodating which added to the overall experience subsidised parking was an absolute bonus and made the travel much easier overall really pleased with our stay and would highly recommend
