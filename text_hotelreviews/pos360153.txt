we had very little sleep as there was a continious banging noise coming from our bathroom it was every five minutes i asked my wife if she wanted to complain but she said she can sleep through it which i could not when the banging did recede at around am i finally got some sleep of which i slept through my am alarm and was late for a family celebration in southall the noise appeared to be from the water pipes i did report this to the staff of which she gave me a per cent discount on the booking which we did not feel was enough we loved the hotel and felt privelidged to be stopping there but sadly came out with a big negative against the many positives
