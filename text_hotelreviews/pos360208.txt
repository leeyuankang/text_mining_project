bed was super comfy view from room was lovely not a peep to be heard from outside or inside nice undisturbed sleep aircon is great there s a phone in the toilet for those tp emergencies i m guessing the breakfast options were brilliant everything from pancakes full english to continental plus some naughty nutella muffins delicious you re directly across from both wembley stadium and the hydro so convenient for events
