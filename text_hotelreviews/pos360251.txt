our overnight stay was excellent the staff were exceptional from reception to the excecutive lounge breakfast was a lovely surprise as the variety and amount on offer was amazing we also had afternoon tea and drinks throughout our stay my first thoughts on booking was that i may have paid a little to much for our overnight stay but when you added up the lovely breakfast afternoon tea and beverages throughout our stay we were quids in my only disappoint we did not have time to stay longer but we will be back
