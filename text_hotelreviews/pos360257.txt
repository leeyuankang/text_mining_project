location for visiting wembley area or shopping at designer outlet excellent across a pedestrian route from wembley stadium tube station five minute walk probably a bit far our for central london sightseeiing but we did it anyway we were attending a wedding so it was ideally suited for our venue didn t have reason to use hotel restaurant but many also available locally
