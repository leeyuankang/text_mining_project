the hotel was nice and clean most of the staff were very accommodating and welcoming the christmas dinner was nice but the year before we had lovely decorations on the table which we did not have this christmas the bell boy was a star we wanted to be near to our family and he arranged it when the front desk tried be very difficult in making the changes the bell boy persued on our behalf and we got upgraded to a suite this bellboy should be the manager he knows how to keep people happy especially at christmas i wanted to see him again to find out his name so i could commend him to his manager
