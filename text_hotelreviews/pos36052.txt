it s a shame there isn t a facility to have croissants or basic breakfast items nice to have a kitchen but you need to go out and get the items which you might not want to do before dressing etc perhaps a delivery could be arranged and people pre order in some hotels i go to rather than have a dining room they have a nice basket of goodies delivered to the room
