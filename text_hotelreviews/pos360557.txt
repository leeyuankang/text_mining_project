loved the check in oscar iglesias was simply wonderful at making us feel welcome he went out of his way to ensure we had a comfortable stay and has ensured that i remember the hilton brand from now on as i am a member of other hotel chains i usually tend to seek out those hotels his wonderful service and hospitality has made me a hilton honors member for life other than that our stay was very comfortable and the location is great right next to the london designer outlet and wembley stadium
