the hotel staff were amazingly helpful and friendly on the first morning of our stay a manager director was in reception asking customers if there was anyway in which he the hotel could help and was very happy to arrange for the hotel to chill our own bottle of fizz for when we returned that night when we got back to the room the bottle was in a bucket of ice with glasses and a couple of strawberries perfect service
