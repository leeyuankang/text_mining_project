we were amongst the hundreds of people who were left stranded in london when british airways cancelled all their flights out of heathrow due to power outage prices of hotels in london skyrocketed and were fully booked everywhere we were so lucky to be able to book marlin waterloo we arrived at the hotel at pm to find a snaking queue of similarly affected people waiting to check in the manager personally came out to greet all the tired guests and assured us that everyone who has a confirmed booking will have a room he also explained that that was only the second day that the hotel commenced operation and that they had not been expecting such an overwhelming number of guests to top off the excellent customer service the f b manager went round with chilled wine and orange juice for all the guests who were waiting to check in the room itself was extremely clean with comfortable beds room amenities were excellent we did not use the other facilities in the hotel but the gym looked pretty decent the hotel is located about mins from lambeth north subway station and a easy mins walk to waterloo station i would most definitely stay at marlin waterloo again and would highly recommend it despite being a new hotel the staff were very well trained warm and very genuine
