we liked the cost of the stay the location was near to the louvre and close to the river and the staff were extreamly helpful and friendly the room was small but very comfortable and there was no end of little cafe s our favourite was a small cafe about mins walk from the hotel which did a lovely rose wine and the chipping sausage and salmon tarte was just bursting with flavour the small park you pass on the left as you walk south towards the river has a stall selling fresh mangoes bananas and other fruits grab a mango here for breakfast for euros they were delicious
