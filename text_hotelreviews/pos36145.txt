the executive room has a hairdryer with cool setting which we ran all night to drown out the street noise and to use in place of the air conditioning that the hotel claims to have but does not permit you to use unless it s high summer the staff were friendly but few one receptionist who also acted as bartender one cook who also acted as waiter plus a cleaner who was quick and efficient but very noisy
