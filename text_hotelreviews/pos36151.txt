location was great and the soundproofing of the room was brill we were on the side of the building so maybe that helped but the moment you opened the french balcony doors youd have this mass of noise from the road which at night was sometimes nice for fresh air but shutting them blocked out most of the noise bar the odd horn our room was bijoux but we didn t care at all as we didn t care about floorspace the location and quality of the room was more important looking st the other best westerns this seems to be one of the better ones oh and it s next to a great tube stop that goes everywhere
