the staff were all very friendly and kindly greeted us each time we came back to the hotel services were beyond expectations chocolate covered strawberries were offered to us at our door not long after we came back one day location was very convenient the catalunya metro stop is located a minute walk away linking different metro lines making it very easy to get around the city the gothic quarter and a popular shopping hub are just a walk away a hotel that i highly recommend
