we really liked the location of the hotel it was easy to access the underground and paddington station being so close to hyde park was a treat we enjoyed a walk on both days we were visiting and would like to visit for longer in the future the style of the hotel is beautiful and the breakfast concierge was very friendly the breakfast was well stocked
