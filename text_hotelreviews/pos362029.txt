i am not convined that the hitel js a star hotel the entrance of the hotel and the lounge is nice and spacious area for sitting for the room we booked it was a twin bed room the room was too small and the furniture is old the bathroom is small too with curtains in the bath which was not enough to stop water from leaking on the floor
