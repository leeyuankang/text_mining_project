location was excellent right at gate to hyde park which was perfect paddington area just a short walk away so lots of restaurants and bars in that area there was a bar next door to the hotel lots on the doorstep staff friendliness was excellent access to the underground lancaster gate was about minutes walk excellent you could walk into oxford street if you wish it s a good walk but if you don t like the underground you could do it
