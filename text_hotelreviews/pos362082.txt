the location of he hotel was in a lovely area right next to hyde park and no to far from oxford street and bus stop was location just on the main road around the corner we did not receive the room that we was supposed to however we knew this when we checked in as we was early and the staff told us this from the start the room located on the lower ground floor which we didn t mind as we wasn t spending to much time in the room the room was quite small and he bathroom was tiny but the room was comfortable and cosy we liked it
