the staff was very obliging and friendly there was a wide range of breakfast varieties even the possibility to order freshly prepared food like porridge or omelette and it was well organized we never had to wait for a table the service at the bar in the evening was also very good we had a problem with noisy neighbors and thin walls but the the concierge was very sympathetic and found another room for us
