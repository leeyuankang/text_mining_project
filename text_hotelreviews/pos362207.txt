location is great right next to lancaster gate tube and around half an hours walk across the park to places like the natural history museum the room wasn t huge but still plenty big enough for the two of us and good value for location and the price we paid there probably would have been room to move the bed away from the wall so i m not really too sure why they have the rooms set up in this way choice of pillows with different firmness was a plus the staff we spoke to were all quite friendly
