a very professional and friendly reception when we arrived it s a sad reflection of today s world that this needs a comment but it does all of the staff we came in to contact with were the same staff in the restaurant cleaners concierge room is well appointed for the price and was clean and comfortable an excellent choice at breakfast to start the day location is superb for so much of london hyde park always being good for a few minutes chill time
