the location was good and the staff reception staff were friendly we paid for a standard double but it was my partner s birthday so the hotel upgraded us to an executive double with no extra charge the room was on the floor had two tiny windows but no view the air conditioning didn t work and there was no hot water we reported it to the reception who sent an engineer after about minutes we had luke warm water and not much hotter the next morning the cleaner knocked on our door at and said we had to be out of our room in an hour yet we had been told we had the room until the next day the lifts were not working properly and the galley ways to each room had poor carpetting if what we had was an executive sized room the standard rooms must be very small the breakfast was good with plenty of choices after paying and then speaking to the manager they did apologise and offered a discount on our next stay
