nice hotel in very good location very good for the price in london we had trouble with an extremely noisy family next door child screaming and laughing practically all night and got zero sleep the first night but the staff were very helpful and moved us to a new room for the next night the walls are quite thin though and the next room was right beside the lift so i could hear that but earplugs worked okay
