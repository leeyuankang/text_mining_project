there was insufficient information in the address on the booking com confirmation and it was difficult to find i called on an international ph standing on a street corner and was put on hold forever i called a second time and got no answer at all there are two entrances and no signage no assistance with bags so i struggled up a flight of stairs and then discovered another entrance with a ramp no one assisted me the hotel is very understaffed children playing in the corridor at night were very noisy room was ridiculously small
