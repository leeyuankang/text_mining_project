we have stayed in the single rooms before and found the executive twin to be the better room for my sister and i it faced onto the road and park but we were not bothered by noise i agree some rooms have been small and need updating but for a short stay they are adaquate we were happy with the staff and facilities the food and organisation had improved a great deal since last year when i did complain about a member of staff and the evening meal my complaint was treated sympathetically at that time our night stay in march was our visit and we choose to eat our evening meal in which was delicious and we will continue to use the hotel for future visits to london lovely location bus around the corner staff who are willing to help with directions we were more than happy thank you
