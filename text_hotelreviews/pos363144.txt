fantastic location out of so close by foot or by public transport to many london attractions across the road from hyde park min walk nice relaxed pace to oxford street or harrods min walk at a slightly faster pace to madame tussauds bus to london zoo right outside the door tube and bus station lancaster gate across the road rooms are in need of refurbishing for sure but the beds were comfortable and the bath towels were so big and fluffy i have had worse in some star hotels the outdoor terrace is beautiful really nice and sunny the bar is small but well set out big screen tv and a wide choice of drinks the staff were for the most part very polite and helpful it can get a bit manic around when load of people are trying to check out at the same time and also around with check ins we stayed for three nights so i witnessed this on arrival and on leaving but that is to be expected otherwise the staff were excellent providing help with directions maps tips and tricks and they are very accommodating for holding baggage for arriving before the room is ready guests and those who have checked out but want a last minute shopping spree without dragging large suitcases with them
