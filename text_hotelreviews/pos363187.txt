the hotel location is great near beautiful hyde park and only a few steps away from the next tube station besides that there are several bus stops right in front of the hotel the room was spacious and bright the beds very comfy not to soft and not to hard the bathroom was on the bigger side generally the rooms are clean though some soft renovation would make the whole package very nice the staff is very friendly and helpful
