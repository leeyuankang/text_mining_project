literally next door to tube station on central line a bit noisy as the building is old and sound insulation was retrofitted not everywhere hot and cold water run well but the shower is mounted to the wall and isn t removable breakfast is basic on a poor side extra eggs and bacon can be purchased separately overall i liked the place and will try to stay there again
