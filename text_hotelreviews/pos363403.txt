the location is excellent within easy walking distance of paddington hyde park the main shops of oxford street and within very comfortable walking distance of all the kensington museums and facilities for the location facilities and cleanliness the room price was very reasonable presumably as compensation for the renovation works the receptions staff were all lovely and very friendly the general ambiance of the hotel was pleasant subdued elegant and understated rather than brash and loud the room was clean and the bathroom spotless with lovely fresh towels and pleasant toiletries
