the reception bar door and cleaning staff are amazing super friendly and helpful the breakfast staff not quite so our room was very clean and comfortable and they decorated it with balloons and left for us complimentary champagne and cake for my husbands birthday which was such a lovely touch if you plan to eat or use the bar in the hotel sign up to the friends program before you go and save on your bar restaurant bills
