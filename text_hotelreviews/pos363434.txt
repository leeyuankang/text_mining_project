the location in front of hyde park around the corner from a central line tube station and just a stroll away from the shopping area at oxford street is perfect all the staff from the doorman to the reception ladies to the personnel at the restaurants and even housekeeping they all make you feel very welcome the food is delicious unfortunately the thai restaurant was fully booked but no doubt that it is wonderful as was our dinner at the island grill you should definitely have an afternoon tea in the lounge it was an experience to remember the rooms are very comfortable and the shower was very pleasant enough water and pressure and no loss of pressure when other rooms take a shower which normally happens in many hotels
