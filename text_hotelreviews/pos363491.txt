i was celebrating my retirement after years as a nurse in the nhs with tickets to a concert in hyde park with a good friend i was absolutely delighted when i checked in to be told by elena at reception that i had been chosen to be special guest of the day she handed me an envelope tied with a pink ribbon and inside a voucher for courses and a bottle of wine in the island grill restaurant for two people my friend and i really enjoyed our meal the food and wine were superb and the waiting staff were great treating us as though we were really special i even had a hand written card and fruit in my room when i returned apparently the hotel picks someone at random every day what a brilliant idea they definitely made my day very special thank you
