this hotel over looks hyde park and is pristine inside with the windows closed you can not hear the road outside which is brilliant the rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy i have no fault for this hotel as the staff were all friendly and eager to help they all said hello if you were walking through the hotel i would most definitely stay in this hotel again may i visit london
