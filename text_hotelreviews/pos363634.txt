location was excellent just round the corner from lancaster gate underground the staff were very helpful and friendly concierge were able to organise a bus tour for my daughter and i also room service was excellent delicious food and quick service beds were clean and comfortable and we had a great two nights sleep would definitely recommend this hotel and will use it again myself
