the room we were allocated to was on floor with a great view across the city landscape and popular features although the booking included the hyde park view and city to get the gardens view it would have to be on the other side of the building room was clean and well presented as travelled with my colleague room had two separate beds comfortably separated clean and well accessible bathroom with no hygienic issues i would agree with other comment that although it is next to the tube station it limits only to the central line the hotel staff was very helpful and check in check out went relatively smoothly we also were able to recover left in the item via mail with no additional costs the breakfast offers a very nice selection of morning food to fuel your day until evening and for those liking more variety a separate section of indian food is served as part of custom we cannot comment on dining and other meals all together i would book my stay again in lancaster london hotel
