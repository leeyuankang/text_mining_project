the hotel is a good one for me it was close to the level of ibis hotels chain i would rate it as a strong stars although it is a stars hotel optimal use of space in rooms simple small but comfortable they put slippers in the room i liked this towels and bath set was available was clean when we entered staff is very friendly accurate helpful breakfast was good they dont have a separate restaurant for breakfast bar and breakfast area is located just near the entrance and lobby which is not very usual the breakfast itself was ok usual cheese butter bread cakes plus eggs omlet and one hot dish location is not bad u bahn is min walk restaurants are close to the hotel you can also walk to the centers but it would take so i used u bahn
