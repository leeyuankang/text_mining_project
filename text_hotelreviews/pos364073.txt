the location was good there s a bus stop right in front of the hotel with approximately short stops until wien mitte there is also a subway station at minutes walk from the hotel kard nagl platz our room was quite big even if we had only a standard room probably because we had the room on the corner the room was very clean the heating worked very well we enjoyed the breakfast it was rich and the quality of the food was good
