i just loved everything about this hotel the location was perfect only a minute walk to the london eye the bar area was really nice and all the food was very good we had lunch there and i didn t think it was overpriced we frequented the bar and was too shocked by the prices there either the staff was super friendly and called for taxis whenever we needed
