it was a nice stay in this hotel although the hotel is not located near the vienna s ringstrasse it has a very easy access to the public transport nearby metro can take you to from city centre tram can take you to from the wien hauptbahnhof and bus can take you to from stadion for coaches directly and there are lots of large supermarket near the hotel which is convenient for us though they usually close at
