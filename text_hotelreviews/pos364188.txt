first of all the hotel is really good but the room is magnificent the bed was awesome and the pillows where great the bathroom was clean as well as the room and the internet connection was satisfying although we made our reservation before our appearance to the reception there was not problem at all the neighborhood is very nice to stay with lots of stores in just a few steps distance the distance of the metro station depends on the weather if it s cold and snowy you gonna think it s too far but in normal circumstances the distance is just fine
