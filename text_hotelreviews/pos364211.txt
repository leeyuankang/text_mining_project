the location of the hotel was great there was everything you needed right on the door step with supermarkets bakery boots superdrug type shop and pharmacy within minutes of the hotel although hotel was not right in the centre public transport was amazing easy to use and extremely cheap we had no issues getting around at all tip getting the bus if you can get your bearings is actually quicker than the train after arriving at the airport if going to this hotel do not get the fast city train as that s a waste of money ask at information for details of getting the local train to st marx for this hotel then once off hotel jump on the bus right outside and get off at the stop and hotel is literally right outside for th first time there it s easier to get the bus but its actually only walk from the station the rooms were nice and spacious and comfortable nice bathroom comfy bed if you have time definitely visit salzburg it was an amazing place
