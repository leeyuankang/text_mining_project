the hotel is nice and my room was big with a big bathroom which is a nice change since a lot of rooms in europe are small the hotel is clean and in an okay location not too much around but there s a grocery store next door and one a few blocks away there s a good little bakery also a block up and the bus to take you into the city center is also close i will say again i really liked my room the bed was so comfortable and i was pleasantly surprised
