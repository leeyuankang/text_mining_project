the beds including the sofa bed were so comfortable we had a rear facing room which did not have a view but when you closed the window all the sound of the city was shut out meaning sleeping at night was uninterrupted all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful couldn t fault them will stay here again if we come back to london perfect for central london
