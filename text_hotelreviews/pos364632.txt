excellent location on a tongue twisting landstrasser hauptstrasse a few minutes walk to wien mitte station with two subway lines and cat train to the airport it takes about mins to walk to st stephens the hotel is in a lovely historical building the room was equipped with all the necessities tea pot mini bar safe i didn t use the hotel restaurant opting instead for a traditional st martin s goose at weissgerber stube in front of the hotel
