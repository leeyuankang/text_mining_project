it is a super nice hotel in a very nice area of town i particularly recommend this hotel to international tourists because the building is very nicely decorated on the insight and the alleyway where it is located is amazing i liked to see the people sitting outside in the restaurant it was a very nice view bed was really comfortable i loved to hear the pigeons in the morning
