we have really enjoyed our four nights in the hotel as soon as we walked into reception we were greeted by cheerful and professional staff our room was even better than we expected the room was specious clean and bright the comfortable bed and quiet room enabled us to enjoy a restful night s sleep the hotel s location is ideal with a short walk to the main wien mitte transport hub with all the supermarkets eateries and services the centre of the shopping precinct and the famous vienna landmarks are only a minute walk away i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends
