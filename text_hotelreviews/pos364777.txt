we stayed at the hotel for two nights and the room is spacious comfortable and very clean the staff is helpful at check in and kindly helps us arrange a late check out on the day we are to leave as well as offer to book us a taxi to the airport the location of the hotel is also excellent it s a short walk from two underground stations there is a very nice playground near one of the stations as well as supermarkets so it s ideal for the family with small kids like ours moreover there are a few restaurants within the walking distance we tried two restaurants as per the suggestion of the hotel staff and found that both places serve very good food though not far from the city centre the neighbourhood of the hotel is quiet and safe what s most impressive at the hotel has to be the breakfast buffet the variety and quality of food provided is even better than some five star hotel we stayed the food is nicely cooked fresh and very delicious there s also a range of gluten free and dairy free food you can choose from which i think is very considerate of the hotel
