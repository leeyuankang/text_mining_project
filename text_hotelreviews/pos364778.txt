central location very close to the city center the room was modern with an elegant design and was very clean the building was renovated and most of the furnishings were new this is especially important since many other hotels in the area are old with outdated facilities the staff were warm professional and were also accomodating i had a request to check out a few hours late they were able to facilitate that request the hotel did not have many facilities like pool or fitness center that however that is to be expected from a city hotel who needs such facilities when you have the city on your doorstep very good value for money
