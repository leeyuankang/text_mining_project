small boutique hotel on the edge of the vienna ring very handy to the museum quarter and a short walk to the metro to travel to the centre of town we were given an extra large room as we stayed nights each room is wine themed and the staff are very knowledgable about the wines served in the bar good breakfast available in the morning
