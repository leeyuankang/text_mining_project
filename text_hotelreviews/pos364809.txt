can t give this place a good enough review a perfect little boutique hotel themed around wine with huge amounts of character and quirky rooms located just outside the central ring road meaning it s out of the tourist highways but close enough for a pleasant walk into town and close to a lot of great local restaurants with prices and quality much better than what s generally available in the city centre the staff were wonderfully helpful and even made sure we were given a top shelf room when i informed them by email that i d booked a special trip for my girlfriend and i highly recommended
