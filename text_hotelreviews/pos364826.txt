they offered to organise airport pick up once i got in after pm i still got a lovely glass of wine at the bar area the room double had all the amenities for a great stay breakfast is a highlight with an excellent choice of coffees and teas plus delicious cakes in addition to all the usual western breakfast foods in summary it is a relaxed perfect place to unwind after the stresses of the day
