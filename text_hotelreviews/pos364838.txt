the hotel is located near many attractions on the edge but a short walk or transit the staff were wonderful and helpful they helped book a tour for me helped with directions and even played nurse doctor when i cut myself the rooms were large and spacious the wine selection in your room is wonderful or you can try from their menu on the terrace courtyard the overhead shower was magnificent
