staff were excellent throughout our stay particular mention for martina terrific rooms clean spacious great shower firm bed and lots of storage the toilet without a wash basin is a bit odd but a minor quirk breakfast is good though a little expensive wine choice and staff knowledge of wines is excellent wi fi is excellent through the hotel
