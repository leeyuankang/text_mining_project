beautiful bedrooms each one individually dedicated to a viennese wine maker centrally located around a minute walk to the museum district and minute walk to rail station wonderful staff who were happy to help give us advise and tips and gave honest opinions on tourist traps v local delights on a quiet street which doesn t draw in hoards of tourists so if you like a lively bar at night this might not be best for you however just a minutes walk away is an amazing roof top bar which is buzzing for us this was the perfect combo the bar at the hotel is open so we often ended the night with a couple glasses of wine whilst chatting to the night staff
