i adored this hotel the larger room was great especially compared to the smaller rooms we had in other places in europe we loved the wine concept it was so nice coming home after a full day and relaxing at the bar w local wine and cheese we stayed here nights and i wanted a couple more it was also cool to be in the less touristic spittelberg neighborhood where people live and hang out i would definitely stay here again and recommend to others
