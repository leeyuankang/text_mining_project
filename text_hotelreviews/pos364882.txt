the staff members were very friendly and helpful the hotel is located close to public transportation and there are many nice restaurants and some entertainment venues nearby during our day stay we managed to eat austrian italian mexican and french food nearby we enjoyed ending a couple nights with a glass of wine in the hotel s wine bar i recommend strongly that you become familiar with the public transportation system as soon as you arrive we could have saved time if we had done so
