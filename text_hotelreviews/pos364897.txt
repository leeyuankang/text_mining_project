this hotel was so good that it changed my husband s attitude about travel in europe i love to travel he usually prefers the comfort of home he gives it stars and that is saying a lot i ve described the decor as upscale design with a sense of humor it was quiet comfortable and clean but these descriptors don t do it justice the front desk people were helpful efficient and friendly all of them and all of the time if we travel to vienna in the future we will stay with them again
