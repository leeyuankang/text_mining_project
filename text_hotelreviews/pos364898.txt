very stylish room the idea of themed rooms seemed a little strange at the booking stage but we loved it in practice staff could not have been more helpful and attentive wines were lovely and breakfast superb secure car parking was also arranged for us very close by minutes walk from the nearest art gallery and about minutes from the hapsburg palace
