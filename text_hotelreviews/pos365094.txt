the breakfast was amazing the junior suite room we had was very stylish and modern nice to have complimentary water and a coffee machine lovely bed and bathroom the location was great only a minute walk from the duomo the communal areas of the hotel were very stylish too the garage is immediately behind the hotel and the garage operator sorted out the congestion charge which was most convenient direct access from the garage into the hotel
