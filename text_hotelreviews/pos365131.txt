super happy with everything my boyfriend has a birthday when we come to the hotel the staff made a special gift for him when we sat in the lobby for a little while and went out to see the city they came with a cake and champagne glasses for both this was super surprise for both me and my boyfriend he thought i organized all this but myself was so surprised i try to find quickly my phone to make a photo if i were to be prepared then i would take this special moment on camera or video because it s memory for life the room was ok little bit maybe expensive i was thinking but because of service in hotel how much attencion they have how special day was for us it was worth it and this day my boyfriend could use bar and all drinking from the bar and snacks for free milan is expensive for example a beer in caf outside cathedral duomo cost and fanta drink a little bit walk from center and its halv price for drinking and restaurang anyway i notice more nice and cheaper to have a drink and snacks at hotel big beer cost inklusive snacks my conclusion about trip to milan its very beautiul and worth to to visit be careful on the street if you stay in nice hotel like we did you will enjoy it service at hotel was the best i ever had if i ever visit again milan i will stay here at nh collection milano president thank you so much for everything i will allways remember you and your hotel thank you xxx
