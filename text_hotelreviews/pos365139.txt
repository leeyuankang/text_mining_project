the staff were amazing from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out they were very helpful the negatives could be dealt with and arent something that would put me off staying there again they gave us gifts for the baby and the location was perfect a short mins with a pram walk from the hotel to the duomo and a further min walk from duomo to the last supper and fashion district the breakfast was lovely and room service was prompt and food was delicious
