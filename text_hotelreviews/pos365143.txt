the facility is great and the people are even better everyone was extremely nice helpful and friendly and that s not everything the hotel is located literally min walking distance from duomo so we could just walk to all the popular places in milan and didn t have to use the public transport at all bonus on the second day of our stay it was my birthday and the hotel crew brought us champagne after we finished breakfast and made my day feel special straight from the start what a nice surprise
