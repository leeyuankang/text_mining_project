this is a lovely modern hotel in a great location near the duomo we just stayed one night at the end of our vacation but the room was good sized with comfortable bedding and modern bathroom facilities the bar and lounging areas were spacious and breakfast was delicious it was a busy lobby with lots of business travelers and returning shoppers stuffing their suitcases
