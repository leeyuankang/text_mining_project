the staff were excellent across the board especially the guest relations desk the location was perfect for visiting the duomo or shopping in the city center the main tram line passes just across the square from the hotel and metro stations are within less than ten minutes walk the buffet breakfast is more than adequate and has plenty of healthy and gluten free options but never changes it s identical every single day the hotel also provides healthy breakfast snack options in the lobby every morning
