fantastic staff who were professional at all times and most helpful we mentioned that we were there on honeymoon and we were upgraded to top level and was nicely surprised with a complimentary chocolate platter room was excellent too always tidied with a special touch closer to a star hotel with top service breakfast was fantastic with lots of varieties also a great location close to all the top attractions will definitely go back
