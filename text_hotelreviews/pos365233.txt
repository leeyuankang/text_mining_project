location is an excellent minuted walk to the duomo and lots of mainstream dining and shopping opportunities we traveled with a months old baby and everything worked according to plan the staff is very helpful and nice they fixed a baby crib in the room and were readily accommodating with our requests ice and a banana for the baby everything with a smile and good attitude we will certainly be back
