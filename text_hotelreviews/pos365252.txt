good central location to the cathedral about a min walk no night life near the hotel had to get a taxi which cost about euro to get to some restaurants and bars staff were very good helpful and smiled hotel was spotless our room was on the floor with a balcony think all rooms with a view had a balcony not big enough to sit on but still very nice to look out in the morning
