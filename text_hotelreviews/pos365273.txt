we had a great extended weekend i milano when we arrived the room wasn t ready so we were offered a drink in the bar and a helpful concierge came over and gave us some advice on what to do and where to eat during our stay we were really impressed by the great breakfast with a lot of choices loved it with the convenient location close to almost everything we can recommend this hotel on my birthday i got a voucher for a free drink when in the bar the staff surprised me with cake and prosecco in addition to the drinks for my husband and me a bit on the expensive end of the price scale but as this was a special weekend we went for it and never regretted it
