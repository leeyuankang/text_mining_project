we checked into the premium double room but there was water leaking from the roof in the bathroom on the second night of stay we called the reception and they sent the maintenance guy within minutes after confirm that it cannot be fixed we have one guy from reception who came and helped us to move to the luggage we were upgraded to a bigger room within the next minutes this is really a great demonstration of showing the utmost concern to the customers
