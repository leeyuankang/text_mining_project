there was a great variety of food for breakfast and the coffee was exceptional i would have loved to eat and drink more and only showed restraint for health reasons the location is within walking distance to a university in milan where i attended a conference it is also close to a metro station where there are several shops moreover a bus to the central station stops right in front of the hotel the hotel has a lift which is nice when you have a heavy suitcase
