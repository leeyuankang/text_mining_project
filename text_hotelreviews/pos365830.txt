just everything the staff were all so helpful at all times very friendly without prying my husband is disabled and has difficulty walking any distance he has his own mobility scooter and as our taxi pulled up the manager was there to help get the scooter out of the taxi and they were just amazing the air condition in our room was superb which we appreciated as the weather was so very hot beds changed every day fresh towels etc every day breakfast was superb and the restaurant with the discount was worth a revisit
