near everything a great location a walk to square where all the tours meet so easy min walk to waterfront just the best location in barcelona doors from the hotel is a big grocery type store with food wine etc to buy at good prices restaurant has breakfast daily buffet for euro and it is a good for that price a busy area but room soundproof so not bothered by traffic noise would definitely stay there again
