best location with the ramblas directly on your doorstep pity there wasn t a rooftop bar or terrace to enjoy in the evening also the shower curtains were a pain and the tv channel selection was awful on the plus side the breakfast was good and the rooms were very good i m sure we would stay again the next time we re in town
