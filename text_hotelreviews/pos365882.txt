since it was my first time to barcelona the staff were so helpful and friendly they organised transport to pick me up from the airport which was really good since i arrived in the evening the location of the hotel is ideal as it is accessible to so many stores landmarks etc which is within walking distance the tourist information office was five minutes away as well as the hop on and hop off buses the amenities and the breakfast was excellent i would highly recommend this hotel
