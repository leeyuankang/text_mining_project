the staff were professional and supportive they exceeded our expectations of service by doing little things like booked a shuttle van without fuss offered to print out train tickets provided extra towels for our children who were showering and preparing to fly back home whilst we remained stored a large volume of luggage for us this hotel is also in a great location an easy central spot we would definately go back again
