brilliant location beautiful hotel very very clean staff were extremely friendly i loved this little hotel and cant wait to return we also stayed at the w hotel but i much prefered royal ramblas the breakfast was very good we had a small double and although it was cosy it was perfectly formed and super clean in fact i think it was brand new everything smelled so clean and new well definatley return
