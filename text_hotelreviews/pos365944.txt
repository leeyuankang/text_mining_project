great people at the reception rooms have all the basic things and a fantastic coffee machine we had ramblas facing rooms which were sound proof can t count on nights with fire crackers and events but still pretty great good location close to the square and gothic quarters and bars and some shopping eixempia with slightly better food options and gaudi s architecture is not far if you enjoy some walking also great for shopping crazy amounts of people just under the hotel and yet the new age comforts of the hotel are a welcoming change off the road as is the bubbly and other goodies for breakfast
