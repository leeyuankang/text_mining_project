location location location if you re looking for a good location in barcelona this hotel has got it right on las ramblas and a block away from plaza catalunya you can literally walk anywhere to see all of the top attentions in barcelona the rooms were modern and very clean small but that s every hotel room in europe i had the option to have a room with the view of las ramblas for an extra a night an option i didn t take but one that s really cheap for the view the staff is helpful and polite there is a restaurant attached to the hotel in which you can order breakfast for i didn t do it because i like to try a different place every time i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting barcelona
