the shower was the best i ve ever experienced in a hotel superb water pressure and temperature high quality towels very minimal counter space in bathroom though although the hotel boasts about it s beds i was not overly impressed with ours good but not great overall experience very good very nice cafes in shepherd market area which is only a few blocks away
