the apartment was an excellent stay for our family with two small children the staff went to great lengths to make sure we had everything necessary for a perfect stay and we were provided with high chairs toys cartoons and even complimentary milk for our children the breakfast buffet was excellent as well and room service from the same restaurant was great we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly be back
