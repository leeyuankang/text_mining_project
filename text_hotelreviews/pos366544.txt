the worst customer service experience i have ever had the staff are rude and very unhelpful they told me i did not have a reservation and left it to me to provide as much proof as possible lots of time wasted trying to deal with this matter and no apology after realising their mistake also had items stolen from our room and reception staff were unwilling to help instead they told me it was a police matter this is a lovely hotel ruined by its rude staff
