the hotel itself was very nice and clean the room was set up for adults and yet there was still ample room for walking and maneuvering around luggage the bathroom was big and had toiletries the a c worked very well and quickly cooled the room the hotel has elevators and a large lobby area with plenty of brochures and coupons the location is close to a tram bus stop but the metro was not too close overall we enjoyed our stay
