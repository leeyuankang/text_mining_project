the room was great all the funiture new and very clean the staff was very friendly and helpful about information and directions we also really appreciated the espresso machine in the room with the capsules not very close fron the center but there is a bus and a tram stop next to the hotel and it s very easy using them definitely our first choice when we visit amsterdam next time
