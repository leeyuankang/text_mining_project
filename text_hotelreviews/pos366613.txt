the hotel is conveniently located right next to the underground garage public transportation right across the street as well as grocery store the room was clean but had a very strong typical hotel smell the smell was in the room and hallways it was not a cigarette smoke to keep in mind breakfast has excellent food selection and good dinner option bed was comfortable and pillows soft
