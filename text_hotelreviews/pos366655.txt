good price for location a bit too far to comfortably walk to centre however public transport really close by and really easy to get to centre using trams also really well located for airport facilities were great nice shower great coffee machine and had all necessary hotel stuff staff very friendly and happy to help giving details of attractions and public transport routes when you check in would definitely recommend if happy to be out of the centre and want to spend a bit less than the central hotel prices
