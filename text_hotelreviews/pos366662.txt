i used public transit throughout my time in amsterdam and this hotel was located near multiple tram bus stops as well as near a train station that went into the city there are two supermarkets right next to it which i always find useful staff was accommodating and friendly it wasn t in a supremely busy area which i find nice after a hectic day in the city the hotel was clean very pleasant aesthetically and the room itself was surprisingly spacious
