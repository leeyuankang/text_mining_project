i spent a lot of time looking for a hotel in amsterdam and hotels in amsterdam are very expensive i travel with my husband and he is very sensitive about hygiene so hostels and rooms with shared bathroom common in amsterdam were dismissed immediately best western blue tower was one of the best option the neighborhood is nice and quiet the first night we came we dined at turkish restaurant marem across the street it was delicious and good price the trams and buses take you to the city center in min we also shopped at the markets near hotel for water fruits bakery cleaning and staff are very helpful at our departure day they advised us how to reach the airport with the public transport cards with no extra payment we went through sloterdijk station we traveled in february and the room was warm and cozy many many thanks
