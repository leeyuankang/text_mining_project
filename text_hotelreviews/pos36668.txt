it s a very nice and cozy boutique hotel in central london with fantastic location and view it s only walk to the green park underground station and easy access to most attractions so ideal for travellers it s also a very romantic place with nice green park view if you prefer quietness you could request for rooms not facing the main road so good choice for couples who would like to celebrate special occasions or just to have a weekend out it s a bit expensive at full price but we booked at discount so feel much more value of money would definitely recommend it to young couples or families if you are not constrained by budget
