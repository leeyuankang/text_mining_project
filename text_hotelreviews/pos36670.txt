always our favourite london hotel all the reception floor frontage recently refurbished and very smart with plush new furnishings the bar is fabulous the staff cocktails were great fun all the staff especially the doormen were friendly welcoming as always room was clean and smart although small never not had a park view before would say they are definitely worth paying extra for we missed that location is perfect within walking distance of most london spots and close to tube station perfect for shopping
