we stayed in a triple room on the tenth floor and the views were stunning at night the room was luxurious for the low price we paid and the bathroom facilities were excellent just beside the hotel were two supermarkets which was convenient for snacks etc there was also a market which took place on the saturday of our visit in the square behind the hotel staff weren t necessarily friendly but they were always helpful when approached with questions
