the hotel was very clean and comfortable staff were friendly and helpful good bus and tram route into the centre of amsterdam which was needed as the hotel is on the outskirts of the city journey in took about minutes your room could be cleaned daily if you wanted but being as we were only there for nights we declined the offer and extra supplies of toiletries and towels were given to us by the cleaning staff supermarket nearby if you want to buy milk for your room and an interesting selection of shops and a market to explore in the area
