the elevators worked the reception floor was clean the sheets were clean and we didn t get robbed unless you count the extortionate cost of the stay which to be honest is probably worse than being robbed they also have bike rentals and other stuff for sale as well as tickets for the public transport not that we used it but it s nice that they have it staff were quite and helpful except for this fat slob who welcomed us on the first day also dial on the phone and the room service comes very quickly the woman who helped us with the safe was very nice
