this is my fave central london hotel staff are awesome its my second favourite afternoon tea sorry the dorchester just pips you but costs more its just lovely i actually had never heard of this hotel until someone i know cant say who mystery shopped it years ago and they aced everything glad to say every subsequent stay has been lovely the staff are friendly efficient and un pretentious which is amazing for a piccadilly hotel i m sorry but over the top airs and graces are just not my thing its not the s anymore the bar has now moved but i like the switch its intimate with good surroundings and the prices aren t excessive either for the location i didn t give the facilities purely because post refurb i didn t use them all as we had a complimentary room upgrade which i wanted to make the most of so i cant comment fully one of my favourite things and i travel a lot for work being a musician is the fact that when asked if i would like my bags taken to the room and i said no its cool as i had a small case there wasn t that awkwardness this happens in so many hotels and it really annoys me they have espa toiletries which are my fave i don t live in london anymore but not far out so never really need to stay but as a treat this is the place i was working in mayfair that evening and thought why not brilliant hotel
