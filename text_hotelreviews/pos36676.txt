lovely hotel in a great location and brilliantly attentive staff and no complaints at all just an opinion that the room we had really didn t justify its price but that did not spoil our stay stayed in a hotel the night before for a third of the price that the room was amazing just a comment most certainly not a complaint and would stay again
