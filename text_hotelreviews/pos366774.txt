the price comfortable beds very firm quite clean easy access to the city centre by public transport not by taxi we did not have breakfasts included but other guests were very positive about it close to two large supermarkets with good choice of food bear in mind that there is a fairly limited choice of pre made meals ready to eat like sandwich or hot food
