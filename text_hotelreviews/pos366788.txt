the hotel is at the outer ring of amsterdam but only one train number from dam square and minutes walk which was great friendly staff willing to help at any time this is a great hotel to come and crash after visiting amsterdam we came at around the reception was open quick checkout large supermarket near the hotel just around the corner thank you for a great stay
