very cosy and clean not in a bad area as some reviews suggest i don t know why they would say think that it was a bit out of the city but we were aware of that beforehand and it was our own choice the tram and bus was very close and a lovely supermarket next door that we got fresh croissants and fruit in each morning i wouldn t hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to people
