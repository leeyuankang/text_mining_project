a reasonable distance from both amsterdam city centre and schiphol airport it was also very convenient to have two supermarkets in close proximity to the hotel my friend and i would stock up on wine and drink in our hotel room although there were only two of us we were given a triple room so it made sense after a few glasses of sauvignon blanc to push all the beds together
