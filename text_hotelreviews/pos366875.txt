nice mattress clean bathroom nice view the bus stop was a minute walk and the buses into town were really interesting as they go through a lot of the city there s a little super market right beside the hotel too we were then moved to a room on the floor which must be more recently renovated or something as it was like a different hotel the view was gorgeous and it had a bath and clean sheets
