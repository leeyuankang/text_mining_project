good size bedroom helpful staff and reception about minutes to the city centre however i was aware of this when booking so not a complaint i m certain a similar hotel in centre would have been double the price so the min tram or bus ride was really no problem and was actually quite a pleasant experience with reliable service plenty of shops restaurants in the immediate area about meters from the hotel
