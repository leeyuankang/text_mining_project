anywhere you looked was immaculately clean from bathroom to restaurant staff were very helpful our bathroom door lock didn t work and the door didn t shut as well as this the safe didn t work we went downstairs and told reception and they arranged it to be done first thing the next day and it was very happy after that the breakfast is average but nonetheless edible i think people expect too much and i m a fussy eater yet i still ate and was satisfied the area is far from the centre but there are several trams and buses that come regularly and if you do your research can get you to the exact location in the centre you would like to visit within mins
