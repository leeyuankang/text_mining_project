we liked the extra attention we received from the staff on my wife s birthday we got a cake and a nice card we have been there a few years ago when there where no construction works going on the lobby was very nice and unique this time the construction was going on so we had to get in from a side entrance although without having a proper lobby the staff did a great job of receiving us every time we cam back to the hotel great work everyone
