had an extremely pleasant stay here staff were super friendly anna gave me a lovely room with an amazing view of green park the doorman are very attentive and always go out of there way to greet you the hotel is under going refurbishment but other than there being no lobby area i would never have known little things like the teddy in the room and housekeeping ringing a door bell instead of knocking were a nice touch
