this hotel has been around for about years art deco design elements bedroom deco reminiscent of that era too but still comfortable clean friendly helpful staff right on a tram link to the main station near a bus link to the airport near the museum quarter and next to a canal with hop on hop off boats hotel recommended excellent local restaurants and we re very helpful about public transport options it s a big hotel so could feel a little large and impersonal for some
