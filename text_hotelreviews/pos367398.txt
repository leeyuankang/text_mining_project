a good hotel with courteous and helpful staff the location is pleasant notwithstanding present street works in the immediate vicinity in addition it is within walking distance of the major museums minutes on foot and the old city centre minutes though trams passed frequently we did not feel the need to use pubic transport two streets of restaurants metres away provided good mainly ethnic choice though not up market in addition however we found some some quality restaurants notably indonesian rijstafel and italian a few minutes walk away and reasonably priced in relation to the quality did not eat at the hotel we would stay again
