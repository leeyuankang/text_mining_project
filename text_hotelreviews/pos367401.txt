the hotel exceeded all our expectations its location is superb the staff are very friendly the rooms are large and the decor is uniquely beautiful the staff accommodated all our needs and we were given a room with a fantastic view overlooking the canal despite construction on the bridge nearby we found the hotel room to be very quiet and the bed extremely comfy we were well rested following our stay the exterior of the building is also unique and beautiful with a nice fountain in front of the restaurant the tram is less than minutes walk away which will take you pretty much anywhere you need to go at a reasonable rate the major museums and parks are also within a minute walk from the hotel
