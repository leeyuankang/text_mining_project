the hotel is in a great location there s a tram stop right outside the hotel seemed tidy and clean our room was very spacious and clean the bed was comfortable it was pretty quiet i didn t hear anyone in the hallway the bar in the lobby is nice they had some fun gin and tonics and the bar itself is really nice
