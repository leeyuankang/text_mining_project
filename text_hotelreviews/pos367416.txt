room was clean and large for amsterdam standards nice bathroom everything was very comfortable overall staff at the reception desk were very friendly and helpful they were great to work with location was terrific quiet but close to everything i would request a room with a view next time as the canal in front of the hotel was lovely i would definitely stay here again
