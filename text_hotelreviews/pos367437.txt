we visited amsterdam for a family event on the city outskirts but my wife and i decided to stay an extra night in the centre the hotel is not completely central but so close as makes no difference due to the existence of the tram line a cheap one hour ticket gets you into the very centre in just a few minutes and it is right next to a hop on hop off canal boat service internally the hotel is very clean and well maintained the staff are very friendly and helpful and the room was a good size very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable we will definitely look it up when next in amsterdam
