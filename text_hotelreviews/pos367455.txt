the staff were super friendly and always dealt with us and every guest with courtesy and patience they switched from dutch to english and other languages with perfect ease and without missing a beat hats off to the cleaning staff who managed our room so well champagne for breakfast too what a treat we could enjoy the wonderful art deco dining room whilst looking out onto leidersplein and watching the world go by the location is perfect a few minute s walk from the tram stop public transport is fantastic and cheap in amsterdam and right next to a canal stop we caught the airport shuttle bus fabulous value at euros each and the stop is less than minute s walk away from the hotel you can see the american hotel just on the other side of the canal as you get off the hotel even gets a mention on the tour buses and boats as they go by because of it s history and significance wifi is fast free and reliable and there are two pc s and a printer for public use we could not fault our choice of hotel for our stay which was based on booking com s members reviews so one again we experienced the value of starting any hotel destination research here on booking com
