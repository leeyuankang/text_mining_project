my granddaughter and i thoroughly enjoyed our night visit in march the location for us is superb in that it is quite close to the dining and public transportation amenities of the leidseplein neighborhood we found this elegant hotel not only delightful but quite comfortable as well the staff were uniformly efficient knowledgeable and friendly we look to forward to staying here again
