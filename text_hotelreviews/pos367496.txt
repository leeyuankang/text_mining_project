fantastic location to explore all parts of the city with a canal just to the front really easy to get to from the airport euros each on a bus which takes you to about metres from the door the staff were outstanding from the moment we arrived we had a very friendly and helpful welcome easy check in and the concierge was extremely helpful with ideas of things to do we d forgotten travel plugs and we were able to borrow a couple free of charge at reception the computers weren t working in the business centre so they let us check in our flights and print boarding passes at reception just nothing seemed too much trouble we had good wifi connection and plenty of sockets to charge phones etc i d definitely stay again
