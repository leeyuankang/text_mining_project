we were upgraded to a bigger room with a little alcove overlooking the canal which was really nice the room itself was very spacious and comfortable i loved having a nespresso machine in the room with loads of choice of hot chocolate coffees tea etc and even though the fridge was an automatic minibar i m not a fan they still had a little section to put your own food drinks which was a nice touch also good for storing gouda if you re bringing it back as a souvenir the location was great close to the museums and not too far from everything going on in the centre there was even a choice of different kinds of pillows
