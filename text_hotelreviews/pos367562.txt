very convenient location the leidseplein stop is being refurbished and cannot used for the ams central direction however still the prinzegracht station is a minute walk away we were given a redecorated room that was spacious with a real big bathroom always feared that i would be given one of the old rooms if i ever stayed there luckily that did not happen very happy for it
