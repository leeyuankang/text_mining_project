the staff was awesome we couldn t have had a better location getting to and from the airport and the centraal station was very easy by taxi we chose to travel by taxi since we had large bags that may have been difficult to lug around on other means of public transportation the restaurant food was wonderful the waitress in the american bar laughed with us and brought us water with ice without us having to ask it was a real treat i would definitely stay there again
