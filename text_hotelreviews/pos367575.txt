the bed was lovely and comfortable all the staff were approachable and friendly it was my partners birthday and the hotel gave us two complimentary glasses of prosecco we were allowed to keep our luggage with the hotel when we had to check out as we had an evening flight to catch so we could continue to explore amsterdam without having to take our luggage about with us and this was free of charge
