the hotel was in simply the best location for visiting amsterdam and the staff was excellent and accommodating the restaurant where there is an elegant feast of a breakfast buffet euros includes unlimited mimosas is one of the grandest rooms in amsterdam you feel like you re in a russian novel but all of this is for the price of a budget hotel honestly one of my favorite places that i ve ever stayed in europe
