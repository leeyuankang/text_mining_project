bedroom was excellent loved the large bed and choice of pillows extremely comfortable free wifi allowed us to use the internet for information on the various attractions and also to use whatsapp to contact friends and family back home for free lovely building both inside and out and would love to visit again in the summer when all the flowers are out staff were excellent and we were able to leave our luggage in the hotel luggage room on our last day whilst we looked around the city
