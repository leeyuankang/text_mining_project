room was quiet and comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly there was a good selection of breakfast food available in the beautiful historic cafe american we paid euros each per day for breakfast on top of the room rate would suggest warm clothing for breakfast during winter months as the large cafe is draughty the hotel was near the canals and museum district
