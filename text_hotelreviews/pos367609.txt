the staff were superb really friendly and helpful the location is great an easy walk to the rijksmuseum and there are lots of bars and resaturants with a wide variety of local and international cuisines around the leidseplein one tip to get to the hotel we took the train from schiphol airport to centraal station and then a tram to leidseplein it s much quicker and cheaper to take the airport express bus to and from the airport as it stops pretty much opposite the hotel
