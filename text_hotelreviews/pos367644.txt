there was a wide range of choice for breakfast from cooked to continental and lots in between the location is great close enough to most attractions either by a short walk or by the several trams that stop nearby the and from central station stop withing metres of the hotel euros cents for a single trip the staff though are superb i had advice from two concierges the reception staff are very helpful as are the staff in the great little bar fantastic for having a drink and people watching in relaxed comfort this is a lovely hotel just a shame about the roadworks see the negative comments it is looking a little tired in parts but dont let that put you off it has character and great staff i prefer a firm bed these felt quite soft so i was surprised to find them really comfy and despite the efforts of the road workers outside i did sleep well
