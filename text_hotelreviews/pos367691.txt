location really good on the fringes of the city centre close to some attractions and a walk to others but what hotel isn t the room was very clean and modern and also the bed was extremely comfortable staff were very friendly and helpful also allowed us to leave luggage before check in and after checking out so that we could get away and enjoy the city without baggage we actually went on a canal cruise right outside hotel to use some time before check in
