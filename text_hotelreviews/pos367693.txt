the location was excellent with a very attractive outdoor fountain and seating area around the caf american central but quiet also very attractive staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful didn t bother with breakfast as we do consider a little steep bedroom was comfy only negative being that the air conditioning seemed to turn off by itself at night making it a little stuffy on a warm night in september don t like to think of hotter weather caf american was lovely we got to enjoy the sunday brunch with the jazz session most enjoyable very happy overall
