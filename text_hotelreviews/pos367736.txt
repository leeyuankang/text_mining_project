the hotel staff were excellent they were always willing to help or even have a friendly chat with you the location was brilliant we were walking distance to everything the staff at the bar american were amazing and made us feel part of amsterdam however the cafe americain despite it s stunning interior were not so welcoming and their selection of food was rather restricted poor vegetarian choices the hotel itself was beautiful and extremely well maintained and the rooms were lovely but the mattress was very soft and the toilet paper was rather poor quality we would return as our holiday was made pleasurable because of the hotel staff the location and the wonderfully historic building
