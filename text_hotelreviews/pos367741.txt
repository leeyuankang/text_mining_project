the best was the location and the staff at check in within walking distance to the hop on and hop off bus and boat tour as well as many restaurants a little far to the train station though the best was the kingsize bed which was extremely comfortable nice was also the balcony the aircondition was very good and helpful on a very hot day in amsterdam
