we enjoyed the ambience of the hotel and the breakfasts the staff helpful and amiable gave good advice and guidance on local activities the bed was very comfortable and by upgrading we were in a pleasant and spacious room with a canal view the location was excellent a simple bus journey to and from nearby to the airport and frequent trams into the centre of the city the galleries and museums area is nearby and there is a huge choice of eateries within a short stroll and the concierge was particular kind about providing help with forgotten medication
