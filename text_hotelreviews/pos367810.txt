we had a wonderful room view on the leidse plein and new york is not the only city that never sleeps but no disturbance of the noise or whatsoever just a lovely view morning and at night time also very comfortable and unlike many other hotels a good room temperature without having to fight with the airco system all personnel was very helpful and friendly
