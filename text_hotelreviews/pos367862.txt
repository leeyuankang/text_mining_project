excellent location very helpful staff one of the best beds i have ever slept in however the room facilities did not match those described on booking com which was a bit of a disappointment so we took this up with the hotel management after our stay they replied quickly and efficiently the mistake has now been corrected and it shows they take guest comments seriously full marks for their genuine concern and response
