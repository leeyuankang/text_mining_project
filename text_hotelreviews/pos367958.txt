fantastic location we were given a room with a view of the canal and it was lovely a voucher for drinks at the bar and a small bottle of prosecco to celebrate out wedding anniversary was a nice touch very big comfy bed only criticism is there is no mirror in the room only the bathroom the full length mirror is by the front door where it is dark
