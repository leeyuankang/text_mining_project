we booked single rooms which were well appointed air conditioning in the room made for a great addition especially as we were there on the hottest weekend of the year so far the bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel surprisingly quiet with no disturbances at night the breakfast was extensive there was a huge variety and something for absolutely everyone staff were very attentive and courteous we also frequented the bar area and took advantage of their offers for cocktails for the price of one from until which was well received all the staff in the hotel are exceptionally polite and attentive nothing is too much trouble free wifi was an added bonus all in all this hotel was excellent for location comfort cleanliness and value for money and i would highly recommend it
