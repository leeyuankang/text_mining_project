great place wonderful staff everything is close as this city is walkable if u like walking and it s only mins from metro so clean and comfortable beds as we were friends travelling we wanted two singles not a double as we requested on booking we were told after booking this was not possiable note toooo late to cancel booking as no refund we spent one night in a double bed this is too small for friends but great for couples but we were moved the next day to two singles which was fantastic the stafff were wonderful and made our stay much more relaxing as room was a better size for two friends
