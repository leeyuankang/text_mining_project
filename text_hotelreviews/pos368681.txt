the thing that stands out the most about this hotel is how unique it is the styling decorations the rooftop bar the amenities were all very clever and well designed for the rooftop bar i really enjoyed the fancy drinks and the antiques scattered around it gave something for you to walk around and look at other than the amazing view i really enjoyed the bikes as well for euro you can get a bike to ride for the whole day surprisingly the bikes were actually very nice belt drive single speeds that were fast and light i actually got great exercise on them along the canal and also explored a decent amount of the city i also enjoyed the shop and fun free postcards they give you they are nothing special but a nice touch i never tried the restaurant but if the food was as good and as reasonably priced as the drinks at the rooftop bar then i am sure it is good for location i think it is good if you want to see the museums and not be too close to the main downtown it is a bit of a hike to get to the majority of bars and attractions near the canal but it is no problem if you are energetic or take the public transport would go back for sure
