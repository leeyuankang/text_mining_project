this hotel completely surpassed all my expectations but can we talk about the breakfast there is a grab and go for euros or complete for euros and both were amazing fresh ingredients fluffy delicious eggs melt in your mouth baked goods and the coffee drinks were the best i have ever tasted the restaurant bar area is very charming and vibrant and the outdoor seating over looks a nearby park
