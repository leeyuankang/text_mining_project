we had a great time staying at the hours it was the first city break we had attempted with our young son and the hotel set a cot up in our room and provided us with a high chair when we ate in the restaurant we loved all the quirky details and the panoramic view from the rooftop bar we had a studio which was spacious and came with a kitchen including microwave the hotel was well situated and we were able to walk to most places
