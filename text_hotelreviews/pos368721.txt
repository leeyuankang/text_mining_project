what s there not to like about this hotel hotels are my favorite chains of hotels i have already stayed at their hotels in frankfurt zurich and berlin now vienna every single aspect of the hotel is wonderful rooms staff restaurant atmosphere common spaces i hope they open more hotels around europe and the location is in the heart of the museums quartier its like an open air museum while walking around in that area
