slightly quirky hotel with plenty of character staff very friendly polite efficient room slightly on the small side but adequate clean and again packed with character the bed was super comfortable like many hotels these days we found the heating to be either full on or off so temperature regulation especially at night was a bit tricky wonderful rooftop bar and even better spa facilities in the basement recommended
