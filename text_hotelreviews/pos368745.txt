amazing vibe great rooms with unique design rish breakfast with plenty of different choices food at the restaurant was perfect and the bar at the top floor just awesome people were coming just to eat and have a drink the location is spot on tram and underground station just min walk the facilities are one of a kind the staff was always helpful and very kind prices were a bit high but we had breakfast included and we stay during christmas holidays for sure if we visit vienna again we will stay there because they are all mad there in a good and funky way
