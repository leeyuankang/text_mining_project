the breakfast at the restaurant was amazing wide selection and all fresh we also liked the rooftop bar however it was a bit too crowded during friday night we loved the design of our room too we recommend renting a bike it was fun exploring the city this way but everything is easily accessible by foot also within a couple of minutes
