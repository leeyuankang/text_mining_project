outstanding design of the hotel moderately psychedelic ambient of the room and the whole hotel high quality of the breakfast and large variation of dishes very nice personnel great location minutes to any sight parking even cheaper that third party parking across the street funny photo booth in the reception very very cool rooms with panorama windows on the upper floors own teddy elephant in each room last but not the list you will remember this hotel for sure
