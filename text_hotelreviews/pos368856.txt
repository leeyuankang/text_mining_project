atmosphere was lovely quirky theme is very well implemented love the doorhanger and the free easter breakfast was a super nice surprise did not try the sauna or gym but all facilities looked very nice reception desk very professional and helpful location is perfect to explore vienna whether by foot bike or public transport even though there s always room for improvement i would definitely recommend this hotel and come back another time
