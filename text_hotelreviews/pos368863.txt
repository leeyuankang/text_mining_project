location was great and walking distance for major touristic places and nice restaurants namely on burgasse just around the corner for volkstheater the space and decor is really modern and fun food is very good from breakfast that was great and we had included in our rate but if not is really worth the money and the restaurant where we had our first dinner very nice staff and the meals are nice and not over priced the view from the room is nice and not too noisy as long as you have your window closed the all theme of the hotel is young and fresh and overall really nice
