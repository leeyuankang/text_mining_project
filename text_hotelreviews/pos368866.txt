i arrived just one minute before the restaurant closed at but they were still ready to offer me a selection of cold plates they suggested i visit the rooftop lounge for a hot snack which was great since this bar is one of the highlights of the hotel and serve hot snacks and great cocktails to liked the option of the free use of my favourite freitag bags during the stay as well as the eclectic design sensibility i always appreciate
