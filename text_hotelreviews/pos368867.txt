the staff were really friendly and we were upgraded to a suite when we arrived we asked for late check out and this wasn t a problem at all we were in room and it was absolutely amazing ask for it if you can we were here over easter sunday and were given a lindt bunny when we arrived back in the room there were so many extra little touches that just made the hotel perfect all of the toiletries provided were vegan and smelt beautiful even if you don t end up staying here i d recommend visiting the roof top bar
