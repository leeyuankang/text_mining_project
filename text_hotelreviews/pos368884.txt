i have stayed at this hotel times now and overall i really enjoy it its close to the subway the rooftop bar is a great place to start the night but wished it stayed open later the pizza at the restaurant is great but it would be nice to expand the choices i was also glad to see that the spa is included now and not a euro add on as it was in the past always nice and relaxing just remember its natural
