even though this hotel is geared for the young we were made very welcome by a friendly staff the buffet breakfast is superb the bar on the floor is very much a young people s venue at night but in the evening it is warm and welcoming with views to die for the metro is close by and many sights are easily reached a stop for the open top bus tours is a five minute walk away
