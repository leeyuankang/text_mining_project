we spent the christmas eve at the hours hotel we had a great time we lived in vienna but wanted to do something different on that date i loved the colorful room and the modern and confortable bathroom specially good was the service at the bar and restaurant the ambiance was really festive the terrace was open so we could go out and enjoy the view of vienna and fresh air between drinks since it was not that cold we had been there many times in summer which is very much recommendable we also liked very much the breakfast the next day there was plenty of options all very tasty
