overall the park international was a pleasant experience it was a new experience to book a single room in the uk didn t realize single room meant twin bed i would recommend this hotel with no problems and i would probably return to this hotel if my preferred hotel the bailey s millennium was not available as was the case this time the staff was friendly and helpful the hotel was clean in both public areas as well as the room the free mobile phone is a stroke of genius and one of the best guest features i ve ever experienced the problem is the free mobiles worked about of the time i was a guest a much better product is needed to make this guest feature a real plus
