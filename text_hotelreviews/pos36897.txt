this hotel was comfortable with friendly staff and a lovely breakfast service it was in a great location in kensington and was near kensington gardens natural history museum victoria and albert museum and about minutes walk from harrods the gloucester road tube station was only a few minutes walk away which was a blessing with our heavy luggage
