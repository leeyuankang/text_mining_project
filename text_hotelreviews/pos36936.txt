we had a lovely quiet room with restfully coloured decor and the bed was very comfy excellent breakfast and no fuss the towels were plentiful thick and soft and the shower was efficient and spotless as our trip included concerts at the royal albert hall the location of park international was perfect taking only about minutes to walk and we felt safe doing so being on a bus route was also useful
