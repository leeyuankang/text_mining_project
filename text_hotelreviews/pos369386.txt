what i liked the most us the location of the hotel very very centrally located ideal the hotel is a boutique hotel breakfast is very good and fresh taken at sister hotel lam e facing topazz hotel however it is expensive euros for the price charged for the rooms breakfast should be included housekeeping is good but can be improved for a star hotel last but not least the staff is very nice friendly and very helpful in particular i would like to mention dimitar and denisa and the front office manager mrs wild
