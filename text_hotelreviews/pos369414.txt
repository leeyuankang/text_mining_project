we liked the helpful staff very much we liked being able to help ourselves to coffee tea in the lounge downstairs we don t eat breakfast so cannot comment on that as it was taken in the sister hotel over the road we loved the position very handy for all outings and sights we had a balcony with no view but it was nice being able to have it open at night
