great location about small blocks away from stephan s platz the hotel s design was lovely the beds very comfortable and the bathroom perfect they also have a lounge in the basement where free coffee and tea are served free all day no coffee in the room there was a nice gourmet type super market right across the hotel and it was very close to the nice shopping area
