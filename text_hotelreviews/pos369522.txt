comfy bed and menu food and service in the restaurant was excellent staff were polite helpful and courteous the bar next door the kuiper was excellent also and very handy for a finish would definitely recommend and stay again although a little bit pricey not best located although tram line is on your doorstep and taxi was each way from airport
