we did not want a city centre hotel as they are small and no private parking this hotel is on the outer fringe of the city centre very well placed for walking and transport and you can park in front of the hotel at a fairly normal charge for city parking staff are v helpful with advice in house cycle hire attraction tickets tram tickets routes etc care there are cyclists everywhere and they have priority there are also pot smokers everywhere and some cyclist smoke pot while they are cycling and answering their phone at the same time so you have to keep your eyes open breakfast is excellent standard or plus which includes cooked to order eggs benedict etc with good service we had a junior suite with small balcony on the back overlooking a v small quiet park room very quiet even with all the windows open minute walk to tram stops and oosterpark a nice green park use the trams they are easy with good route message screens cost a day and save miles of walking we came back one evening on a tricycle taxi very refreshing on a warm night decor is art and corridors a bit vivid and rooms quirky but not unpleasantly so nice hotel for our nights
