the hotel is located outside of the main city but just a short tram ride away it was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of central amsterdam and enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere around the oosterpark the hotel was excellent very clean the staff were friendly and the room and facilities were fantastic we ate in the restaurant one night which was nice but a bit pricey
