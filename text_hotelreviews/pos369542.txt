the hotel was quite posh the decor was urban and cool and the breakfast was great the front desk staff were all so helpful and nice since i was unfamiliar with amsterdam before my trip i chose this hotel mostly due to ratings photos and price it is on the eastern side of the city but there are a couple of trams that stop very close to the hotel so getting to other areas of the city aren t an issue
