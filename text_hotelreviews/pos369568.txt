we celebrated my fiancee s here and i was so happy with the location very close to the train station and a few different tram lines it was easy and quick to get central a lot of the more central hotels i feel would have been too loud at night time and we wouldn t have slept well but we loved that the rooms were very comfy even on the front of the hotel it was so quiet and the curtains are so effective that it was literally pitch black in the room when it was light outside in the morning the staff were on the whole lovely they were happy to hold our bags before check in and after check out until we were ready and even printed our boarding passes would stay here again
