the hotel staff were extremely friendly it was our wedding anniversary and they put a bottle of bubbly in the room along with a note wishing us well the room was perfect also when you come out of the hotel take a left under the bridge and there is a little shopping area which we found by chance on the last day trams are very easy to use hop on hop off wonderful city and would go back to the hampshire again
