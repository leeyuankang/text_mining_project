lovely hotel i stayed here in june with a group of friends and then rebooked after my first visit and stayed in december with my husband the rooms are a good size as are the beds when staying with friends we had three beds in each room and there was still plenty of room to move around and get ready the bathrooms are a nice size too modern and very clean the staff were very helpful and accommodating we needed an iron one night and one was brought to our room within minutes of the request to reception they also printed off tickets for trips we had booked online the hotel is a little out of the centre however there is a tram stop straight outside the front of the hotel and the trams runs late we found that from collecting our bags at the airport we were at the hotel checking in within the hour this was after catching the train to the main station and then the tram to the hotel their are plenty of bars and restaurants around the hotel too and the italian restaurant in the hotel is nice if you fancy eating in one night this is a great hotel and i have recommended it to a few people since i have returned i would certainly use it again should i return to amsterdam on both occasions we arrived before midday and we were able to check in early free wifi is also a bonus
