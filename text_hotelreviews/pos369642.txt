this is my second visit to amsterdam and likewise my second stay at the manor hampshire hotel it is a stunning historic building that has been thoroughly updated inside i love it s convenience and location it is far enough away from the city center to be peaceful yet near enough to main trams that get you to the city or to the museums quickly the neighborhood is considered up and coming and has plenty of stores and restaurants the room decor is quite amusing see picture of the graphic over our bed and the colorful red crosses from the amsterdam flag are everywhere our concierge hans was so helpful and knowledgeable going out of his way to find a specific restaurant for my vegetarian husband i will definitely return for another visit to amsterdam and i look forward to staying in the manor hampshire hotel in the future
