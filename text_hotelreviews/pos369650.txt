we enjoyed the manor hotel because the staff was friendly and helpful the room clean and comfortable and we liked being convenient to tram and to reach all the important sites the hotel is in a nice residential area with good services away from the most touristic areas tram is convenient and reasonable with appropriate pass as needed we purchased it right at the hotel desk the breakfast was not included but reasonable as we took offer on our arrival
