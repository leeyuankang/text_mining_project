the service throughout our stay was absolutely excellent every time we had a question it was dealt with professionally the rooms were really modern and clean along with having black out curtains which made for a great sleep we also hired bikes which was really fun the hotel is only a short tram ride in to central station about mins max and trams are very frequent it was much quieter than the old town and in a really nice area with a gorgeous park across the road i will definately stay here again and have already recommended it to several friends
