the hotel is nicely located on the south eastern edge of the city center in a nice neighborhood this is not the right place if you want to be in the absolute city center but it is highly accessible being located at the intersection of major avenues with multiple tram and bus lines stopping in front the hotel has a dated outside but the interior is nicely renovated in a modern style we especially liked a fun gag at the reception there was a toy robot which could dance sing and communicate with guests it made for a nice start of the day the staff was nice and helpful we got the room at a last minute discount rate normal rates seem overblown for what you get
