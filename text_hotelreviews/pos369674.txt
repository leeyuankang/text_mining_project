although the hotel isn t in the city center connections to city center are excellent the tram stop is couple of meters from hotel entrance so you re never really far from central attractions i imagine this would be very useful for getting around the city if you re not cycling or driving neither of which are recommended for first time visitors or those who don t know their way around amsterdam oosterpark not to be confused with the famous vondelpark is a minute walk there are many general stores nearby to fulfill your living needs and if you re feeling peckish at in the morning room service has you covered on premise private parking was available at a reasonable for amsterdam per day the hotel has an aesthetically pleasing fa ade which some might even find grand our high ceilinged room was spacious by european standards all my encounters with the staff were positive it is a safe neighborhood and there are some nice coffeeshops within walking distance if you want to unwind at the end of the day
