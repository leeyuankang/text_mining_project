check in quick and simple large and spacious rooms friendly and helpful staff located a bit outside of amsterdam oost but there are three different tram lines that will take you anywhere in no time walking into the city centre is also really nice would i go again it s a really nice hotel but for my next visit to amsterdam i would probably choose a hotel located next to a canal in the city centre for the real amsterdam feeling i saw they have other hampshire hotels in amsterdam located more centrally so i would probably consider those
