i have purposely did not choose the hotel in downtown as normaly they charge too high just for the location and rooms most of the time are not comfortable this hotel is located minutes by tram to downtown the tram ticket cost good and clean rooms and very polite reception they also have the parking space which will cost you around for hours but better book the parking in advance
