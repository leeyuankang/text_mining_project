the staff were really nice and friendly there was a problem with transacting the money to pay for the hotel but they ve managed to help and sort out the problem the hotel has also given me and my partner a better suite than what we paid for due to them running out of double beds it was a lovely stay really nice location next to a beautiful park easy to get to the city centre but yet still quiet and clean area the beds were comfortable and the decor of the place was fab would recommend to anyone considering
