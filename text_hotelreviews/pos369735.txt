the hotel was very clean and affordable the room was really wonderful with plenty of light and room enough to move around closet space was more than adequate the bathroom was roomy but no shelf space to out your lotion or cosmetic this was a very nice last minute find as i had to leave another hotel which was subpar and the same price an up to date lobby which was welcoming the staff were so accommodating and friendly breakfast was not including in the price but i could have done that breakfast was plentiful and had variety of breakfast items to choose from my room was quiet even though it was on the front of the building facing the street transportation tram right outside the front door took me to center city in less than minutes wonderful location in the city but not in the heart of all the noise and tourist bussle
