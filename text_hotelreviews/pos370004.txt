we liked that there is a big selection of different kinds of vegetables like beet roots carrots and tomatoes also eggs were baked and fried there was possibility to prepare waffles yourself also all kinds of jams were available milk was cold and hot rooms are clean and big there is enough space for big suitcases we could leave our car on street opposite our room window and no need to pay on sundays if you like walking then its a very nice walking to the city about each way to reach westbahnhoff and mariahilfestrase but also tram stop is near the hotel and ticket costs eur
