this clearly felt like a to star hotel nice bar the breakfast is out of this world everything that you can look for the hotel was very clean and the rooms were really large sized as well having strong ac was another positive the sheets were clean and the bed comfortable enough the ladies who manage the big breakfast hall were very friendly i loved how one of them went and got me a coffee at just when they opened to take outside to the open sitting area for a smoke i ate breakfast only later and just need a coffee early very friendly staff the location is good with a tram line right in front that takes you a few km to the city center easily minute walking to the schonnbrunn palace which is another plus point
