the hotel is clean nice and cozy the people were very nice especially a young romanian lady she helped us very much by giving us accurate transport directions the cleaning was made daily also the towels changed every day flatscreen tv a small fridge empty no unsolicited beverages the bathroom clean quite big also the room was big the matresses were confortable but the our double room had single beds put together insted of one double the breakfast had many items good quality it consisted of the classic items ham cheese salami eggs tomatoes cucumbers fruit cereal jam honey juices different pastries etc but also fruit salads fruit yoghurt pancakes one day apfelstrudel some days even vegetable soup which we did not try we had a room facing the street and not on the railway so it was also quiet the location is not extraordinary but also not bad near schonbrunn you also have one hofer market near same type as lidl and a billa you have a tram near the entrance of the hotel metro station not far approx min walk i guess but you may need an hour to get in center especially in the evening all in all very good price quality ratio would definitely recommend for the price you pay in vienna you get super value
