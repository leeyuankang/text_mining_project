the hotel was beautiful exactly as we d expected and more glass and mirrors glass lift very clean and friendly helpful receptionists the room was wonderful spacious big comfy bed fab walk in shower and separate toilet the only draw back was the lack of drawers to put your clothes but we got round that one and it was only a minor problem there is also a terrace at the top of the hotel and a plunge pool but we didn t have the time to explore looked like a sun trap though we were very impressed by the cleanliness of the place and how contemporary everything was staff are very helpful and the room cleaned every day to a very high standard we didn t sample the breakfast as it wasn t included in our package and preferred to go out for our meals anyway totally delighted with this hotel and was very comfy for the nights we stayed here would definitely recommend
