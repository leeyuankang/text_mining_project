our second stay at this quiet modern hotel which is a short walk from selva de mar metro station and close to the diagonal mar shopping centre in the opposite direction lots of restaurants near by the block containing the hotel is flanked by a sports park and a further park near the shopping centre has one of barcelona s wacky sculptural steel arrangements which is worth seeing great welcome at the hotel on arrival and no fuss when we wanted to leave our bags in storage on departure day reception staff are fluent in several languages and very helpful selva de mar is or metro stops from the main attractions in the city centre so we tended to go out early and then stay out until after dinner during summer the green route of the bus turistic also stops a short walk away as it s a purpose built hotel rooms are spacious and decorated in a stylish modern way there s plenty of light available free safe hot drink making facilities and fridge mini bar the glass fronted bathroom is initially disconcerting but is built with privacy glass so no worries there and again there s plenty of space and a reasonable hairdryer we didn t use the restaurants or cafe bar this time as there are so many options in barcelona but again these spaces are comfortable and well laid out a real gem if you are ok staying away from the centre
