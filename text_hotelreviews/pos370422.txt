from the moment you get inside you know you are in the right place our staying there was absolutely amazing the staff was so helpfull and trust me i needed them all the time beacuse i was traveling with my older parents and the fact that the sweetest receptionist named diana called and looked up for us the best spot to get to see views without walking too much for my parents was so nice everyone there always took care of us and made us feel like we were staying in a stars hotel the fact it was so near to the beach and the mall was a bonus huge thank you
