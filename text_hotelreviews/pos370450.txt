this property was a pleasant surprise for us after a horrible experience at holiday inn express few kms away staff at the reception was super efficient we checked in like under mins and they advised us on which places to see directions and average fare for transport their willingness to genuinely help out was extremely appreciable wifi was pretty good and breakfast was superb too metro station is mins away and a big diagnol mar mall is mins away we walked to the beach in mins services was excellent and we wish them all the best for future and hope they maintain their excellent track record
