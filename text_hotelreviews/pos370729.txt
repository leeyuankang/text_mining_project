booked doubled bedded room almost months in advance and this was not available then even though we were let down on this as it was the only reason we booked this hotel and used booking com to add insult the room had only a double bed in and not additional bed even though it was clearly a booking for and the double bed was requested poor from the hotel and a very misleading booking engine on the booking com website which clearly does not stress that your booking is only a request until after you take the booking i will be reporting my comments to stranding standards as an official compliant
