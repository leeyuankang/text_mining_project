every member of staff went above and beyond to ensure that our stay at the marriott county hall was absolutely fantastic when i mentioned at check in that my husband and i were spending a last night together before he went away for four months work we were asked to wait in the stunning bar for ten minutes and when we went up to our room there were rose petals on the bed and complimentary champagne in an ice bucket plus a box of chocolate truffles incredible service and such a lovely surprise the room itself was perfect the bed sumptuous and everything had been recently renovated in a luxurious modern style that still managed to echo and complement the history of the building little touches like being able to easily link our laptop to the tv and watch movies from our own netflix account was a huge bonus the hotel and amenities were beautiful but it was the wonderful friendly service where nothing was too much trouble that made our stay so memorable i hope we ll be back soon
