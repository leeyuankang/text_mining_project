it was a hotel you get what you pay for excellent all round amazing breakfast with great service managed to get a good deal on dinner for people having courses a glass of wine and a big bottle of water sat looking at the london eye for including there service charge i thought that was a great deal considering the location the quality of the food and our waiter was brilliant the hotel room was a decent size with a king size bed which was really comfortable the tv had sky sports and the hd chanels so i wasn t really bored while i was waiting for the other half to get ready it was the little things that made the hotel to me heated mirror so it wouldn t steam up when you were having a shower a decent iron complementary coffee and tea the safe in the room was also free every single member of staff we came across all seemed to be happy and greeted us appropriately i would deffinitly stay here all the time if i could afford it
