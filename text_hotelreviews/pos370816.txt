all the staff were fantastic myself and my wife were made to feel very special which meant a lot to me as it was my wife s birthday we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne which i also really appreciated we have stayed in many hotels all over the world and i would say the london marriot was the best overall thank you so much carl benson
