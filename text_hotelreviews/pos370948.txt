me and my partner stayed at the level for our anniversary we were wonderfully looked after like royalty by friendly smiley faces we arrived to romantic petals champagne chocolate and fruit in our amazing room that overlooked the beautiful city of barcelona and the sea we explored all of the hotels facilities throughout our stay and were not disappointed by the variety of food and drink on offer at all the different bars restaurants terraces within the hotel although drinks were expensive we were fully prepared for this to be the case and the free bar in the evening certainly made up for this we also enjoyed the luxurious spa facilities which did not fail to meet our expectations our massages were incredibly relaxing and set us up for a lovely soak in the jacuzzi and other facilities such as the sauna the staff were very open to recommend new places for us to visit as this is not our first time in barcelona we were keen to find some new local restaurants and bars and they certainly had some good recommendations which were located within a perfect distance from the hotel we have had such an amazing time in barcelona and will definitely think about staying here again
