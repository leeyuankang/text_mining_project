very attentive staff excellent location literally on the doorstep of sloane st and walk in heels from hyde park nespresso coffee machine in the toom is a nice touch plenty of wardrobe space to keep luggage and room size was fairly decent which was a concern to me after reading a few reviews beforehand saying the rooms were too small you also get robes and slippers and an umbrella for that typically british weather in your wardrobe
