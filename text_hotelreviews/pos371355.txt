the hotel was immaculate and staff very friendly and helpful great beds and good size room with excellent shower the location was perfect in the gothic quarter with lots of great bars shops and tapas restaurants for all budgets nearby only euros by taxi to get to the port so the beach bars and restaurants were very close by too would definitely recommend if you prefer a smaller more intimate hotel
