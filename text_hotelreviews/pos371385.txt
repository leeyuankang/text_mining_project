the location was just off the main roads and very convenient for access to most of the old town sights and within easy walking distance from the harbour the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with a particular mention for eduardo who assisted in booking tickets and a daily weather forecast as we don t like a large breakfast we did not eat in the hotel but they did provide guests with a free buffet of various snacks available during the afternoon we would be happy to return next time we are in barcelona
