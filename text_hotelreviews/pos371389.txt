we feel really welcome the personal was so helpful long long time we don t feel so good in one hotel like we feel on this hotel please don t change i think we loved barcelona because we was in this wonderful hotel it s a normal very clean hotel with a nice breakfast near from everywhere and everything but the management is brilliant the staff makes the difference
