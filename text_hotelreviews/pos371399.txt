the staff were extremely helpful and friendly breakfast was outstanding as was the free snack bar from so you felt you could come back to the hotel and relax if you wanted a break from sightseeing in the afternoon location was great close to everything but slightly set back on a quieter street and the room was much larger than we were expecting we will definitely stay here again and recommend to family friends
