so where to start with what we liked short version everything perfect location friendly staff relaxing small pool great breakfast comfy room nice spanish and catalan restaurants very nearby and free snack bar in the hotel long version really unbeatable is the location it is only by foot from placa catalunya one of the central spots in town from where you can start for tours or go shopping or walk down to the ocean my daughter and i were super happy to always have just a quick walk back to the hotel to get rid of bags or grab a coat or so there are also many very nice little tapas bars and restaurants just around the corner of the hotel so we could choose a new one every evening within a walk try can pescallunes catalan only open thu sat if you get a chance and fancy a real catalan experience it is operated by a catalan family with catalan dishes the hotel staff was very friendly spoke spanish english french and even some german and made us feel welcome always the room was spacious comfy and very clean breakfast was maybe a little pricey at per person but had a very wide selection we also had breakfast twice in a cafe nearby called on via laietana walk which was also very nice cheaper of course but with less to choose from the pool was not very large but warm and with a lot of massage jets super relaxing with a steam sauna roof top pool was not open while we were there in jan but we could take a drink up there and enjoy the sun in the lounge chairs with some music playing in the background probably most amazing to us was the free snack bar in the hotel lobby from you could grab a snack whenever you wanted and that included soup wraps pasta salad salad chips pastry and coffee tea soft drinks
