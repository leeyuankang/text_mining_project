recently stayed as a couple over the new year for nights the staff were very helpful showing nearby recommendations etc also loved the offer of a free spread from as it s that awkward time of feeling peckish a fruit bowl and drink filled it lovely decor found our bed very comfortable and loved the indoor steam room jacuzzi as it was out of season to use the outside pool overall a fab stay would highly recommend location is perfect near enough to walk pretty much anywhere including the beach if not the tour bus stop isn t too far away either
