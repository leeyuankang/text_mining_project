everything about this hotel was just wonderful the location is perfect right in the heart of the gothic quarter two blocks from la ramblas and two blocks in the other direction to the cathedral and although the hotel is just a block off of a busy street the windows cut out all the noise critical for a good night s sleep the staff were friendly and attentive and helped us to get oriented to the city by providing a map directions and recommendations for restaurants and things to do the room was clean and well appointed and the bed was the most comfortable one we ve ever had in a hotel the rooftop pool area is a great place to unwind at the end of the day and having outdoor space at a hotel is a real bonus
