for those who do not want to read a full review here s a summary fantastic hotel location staff what more do you need we arrived late on the monday evening tired from a long flight the staff instantly made us feel welcome and check in was a breeze the room was immaculate and this was maintained by housekeeping throughout our stay the little touches such as the walk in shower are modern the second day we went out to explore gorgeous barcelona and found that we were in an ideal spot seconds from the main shopping streets and public transport yet out of the way enough to not be bothered by noise there s amazing restaurants and bars within a one minute walk whether you want a light tapas course meal or just a drink the third day we decided to stay around the hotel and make use of the rooftop terrace pool bar the pool is amazing and they ve done wonderfully well with a city centre rooftop free food fruit soft drinks are available from the bar on the terrace with alcoholic drinks also very reasonably priced by friday our final day we didn t want to leave this amazing hotel or city we had an evening flight and mentioned this to the reception staff they were only too happy to store our cases encourage us to make use of the facilities all day and even shower and get changed after checking out nothing was too much trouble i couldn t recommend this hotel highly enough and we will certainly be staying again
