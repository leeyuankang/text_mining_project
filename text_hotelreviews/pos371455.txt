i liked the placement of hotel down a back road away from the main street but close enough for walking approximately miles to the sagrada familia and even closer to gaudi s casa batll and casa mil all which are must sees in barcelona the hotel was just fully remodeled a coulee of months ago and one can still see and smell the newness we did not try their breakfast as we are not breakfast people and prefer to try the local restaurants and tapa bars
