great hotel very central location with all the main attractions within walking distance and the best staff i have ever come across for me it was raquel and her team that made it a special trip we went there with our two little kids and they took care of all our needs be it planning a trip in or out of the city upgrading to a bigger room or booking an appointment with a beauty parlour all taken care of in the most friendly and professional manner raquel even called a taxi firm to complain on our behalf when the taxi driver seemed to over charge us the free snacks were a real plus especially when you are travelling with young kids and feel a bit peckish late at night the room was really good for a and the bed very comfortable all in all very pleased and highly recommended
