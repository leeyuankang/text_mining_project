wonderful hotel i couldn t believe they were newly opened because it functioned like a well oiled machine staff was impeccable helpful and kind how wonderful to come home from dinner and going out to be greeted with a kind hello and offer of coffee and cookie the location was perfect close to everything we walked everywhere from here the room was small but pristine a perfect use of space and the rooftop pool was a highlight as were the snacks by the pool from and they were great snacks many choices and healthy options would definitely stay again and felt it was a great value if you re considering this hotel stop looking as i did for ages and book it
