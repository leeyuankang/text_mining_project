very friendly and efficient staff lovely quiet hotel immaculate and clean and rarely for a hotel no noise from the steet at night roof top bar and pool area was lovely and the free drinks and snacks all day was a very nice touch the position of this hotel is fantastic as many tourist areas are within a few minutes walk would definitely recommend this hotel
