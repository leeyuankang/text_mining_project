great location everyone says this but this hotel is near to main road and taxis but in a quiet street v close to great places to eat and shop yet not the midst of tourist muddle staff helpful great view from pool free snacks and coffee daily rooms well laid out thus feel spacious good block out curtains and sound proofed windows
