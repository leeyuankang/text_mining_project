the staff was very nice and helpful location was perfect in walking distance of la rambla the outside area was nice with benches and a pool and we used it a lot when it wasnt raining everything in the hotel was very new and clean and the room service cleaned every day and gave us fresh towels which was good the free snacks during the day was nice as sometimes you just need a little bite we loved this hotel and would definitely reccommend it to anyone
