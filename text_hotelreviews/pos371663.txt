really liked the terrace bar especially after a busy sightseeing day you could eat and enjoy a drink there also nice to sit by the pool although smaller than expected could do with more beds as peak summer was an easy walk to the magic fountains and can get buses from there to las ramblas and the touristic buses the taxis were on strike as we left but the airport bus was there as well a min journey for euro taxi is euro
