i must have reviewed this place about times at least as we stay there every year it almost feels like a home from home not sure i have much new to add off the train over the road check in drinks on the terrace within minutes of arriving in the city the staff are lovely the rooms are fantastic the beds are comfortable you get a brilliant panoramic view of the city from the terrace bar and usually a decent view from your room balcony too we even had an actual bathtub this year i don t know if all the rooms have one but i m sure they ll sort you if you ask same time next year then of course
