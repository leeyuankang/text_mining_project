overall we stayed at the hotel on two occasions and found that our impression was dependent on our room location our first room a king bed room was not good cramped and no where to put things and located near the lifts so we were disturbed by late night revellers our second stay was fine we upgraded to an executive double room high up away from lifts much more pleasant
