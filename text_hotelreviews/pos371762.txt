excellent breakfast and very helpful staff we needed to print our boarding pass and they did it for us and delivered it to our room also we rented bikes for half a day directly from the hotel which was very easy the hotel is not in the centre but you can reach it in minutes by subway so it s very convenient being near the sants station it is extremely easy to reach by train from the airport the hotel is surrounded by nice places to eat we would like to flag la paradeta for fresh fish
