staff was super friendly english was excellent and they are hours the lounge is beautiful downstairs and the front desk is very helpful for giving you a map of barcelona and giving suggestions as to what to do to help orient yourself the hotel itself is near the train station so that s a plus if you re going by train they are willing to hold your stuff the day you check out so you can enjoy the rest of the day in barcelona and get back to the hotel get your stuff and make your train that evening
