the location was great for our purposes but not so great for the noise of the funfair next door which was particularly loud at the weekend however we were often so shattered from our full days and nights that it wasn t too bad lovely lady called jasmine on reception who was very helpful and cheerful and upgraded us rooftop pool was nice to end the day overall a good place to stay
