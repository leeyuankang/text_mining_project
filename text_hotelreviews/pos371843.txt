very good location if you need to catch a train next day otherwise its a rather uninspiring part of barcelona close to plaza espa a but not that close view is mostly blocked by some office buildings but you have a nice outlook on montjuic rooftop swimming pool is tiny but still nice rooms are good but who wants to stay in a hotel room when in barcelona
