location to barcelona sants train station easy to find and only minutes walk from entrance of station we only needed a place to stay overnight between train journeys and this could not have been better the staff were excellent spoke very good english and the check in out procedure went smoothly if staying in the city for a while they provide information on what to do where to go etc would have been very useful if we had stayed longer
