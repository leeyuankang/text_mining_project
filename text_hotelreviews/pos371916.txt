it was quiet at night so we were able to get a good nights sleep the beds are comfy and the room was very clean the sheets and towels were changed every day the reception staff were exceptionally helpful and eager to assist in any way the free wi fi was very good in all areas of the hotel we felt safe in the locality and the metro and buses are only a short walk away the terrace bar is very nice with friendly staff and a good view of barcelona from there the public areas of the hotel have been decorated to a very modern high standard the breakfast is good value at euros each if you pre order at reception if you don t pre order i believe it is euros but very tasty and a good selection of food and beverages
