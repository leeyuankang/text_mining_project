reception staff i was just a number my executive room was on floor it was a star hotel although i stayed there before but i realise the standard now is much poor than before there was a kettle in the room but no clean water only from bathroom tap there is tea bags but no milk there is sugar but no coffee what a stupid stupid idea of service i want to make coffee there is no coffee no milk you have to ring for the customer service through your room phone i decided to go out and have coffee while i was leaving i was told a euro extra bill for telephone services i told them that i had my own mobile i did not touch the phone i was told that i ordered for the customer s service for tea or coffee i told them that if you want i can pay you but when did you brought tea or coffee for me she had no answer and called the manager who waived the charge saying that it was a mistake i thanked them but what a unprofessional attitude of a professional person
