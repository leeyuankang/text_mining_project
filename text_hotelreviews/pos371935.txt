the staff were fantastic they really went the extra mile to make this such a special stay for us they really stood out to me and my partner everyone was so approachable spoke great english and was willing to help the whole time the hotel room was beautiful modern and really comfortable to stay in it was lovely to sit out onthe balcony in the evening we even had a little fridge in our room which definitely came in handy we ordered room service twice and both times it was lovely the cleaners also did a lovely job fixing up the room whilst we was out overall we could not have chosen a better hotel it was perfect for our stay and we were very sad to leave would strongly reccommend this hotel
