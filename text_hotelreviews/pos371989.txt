staff were friendly and helpful our room was spacious and comfortable the roof top deck has a pool sun patio and a lounge we found the location of the hotel very convenient and returned mid afternoon to chill for an hour in between sight seeing and other activities located on a metro line it was very easy to get around the city the hotel is also right by the main train station which made access to the airport very easy
