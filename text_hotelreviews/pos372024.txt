the only good aspect of this hotel is the roof terrace and a pool which you won t use much if you want to visit the city we never had breakfast in the hotel as it was way too expensive just outside the hotel there are lots of cafes where you can grab a much cheaper breakfast room old and not too clean we had to change room the second night due to a sewage smell coming from the toilet not sure how the hotel is classified as a star hotel
