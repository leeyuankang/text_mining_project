the second time i have stayed here and both times the staff have been lovely and welcoming the rooms aren t exactly what you may expect for a hotel but when you reach the rooftop pool and bar area with views out over the whole city you really appreciate the rating great location right next to barcelona sants station perfect for commutes to the airport or elsewhere
