absolutely fabulous hotel everything from the interiors of the reception the staff the level of service the funky room and the rooftop pool terrace were wonderful a very enjoyable stay in the eiaxample area of barcelona so a walk to marina and old town yet benefits from a peaceful location loved the in room music system which pumped through to the bathroom very informative reception staff
