lovely staff particularly the front desk and also the breakfast team particularly vanessa whose smile lit up the room room was very comfortable beds pillows everything loved the ambience in the foyer of the hotel with people busy on their laptops or sitting having coffee drinks etc there wasn t a lack of social interaction it was buzzy without being noisy
