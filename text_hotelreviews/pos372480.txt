when we arrived the staff were helpful in directing us to their hotel it is difficult to find but after circling the block a few times they were able to give us better directions than our gps gave us they brought us a bottle of champagne after we found that our room was sweltering and when we tried to turn it on in the room the staff admitted that it was not turned on in their main control room even though it was degrees outside and super hot in our room the bed is super comfortable the softest bed in the hotels we stayed in during our spain portugal trip they offered complimentary water and cokes in fridge and left coffee packets for the mornings the front desk staff were wonderful directing us to amazing places to eat in the neighborhood and giving us great directions on how to see specific sights and directions to the metro location is excellent easy to get to all the sights in barcelona with public transportation
