i travelled in a group and i couldn t fault the hotel at all the staff couldn t do enough to help lynn was especially helpful the rooms are lovely and the beds so comfortable the pool on the rooftop terrace was a bonus and so relaxing after a busy day i would definitely go back to this hotel on my next trip to barcelona
