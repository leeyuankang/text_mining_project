excellent night stay at the corner hotel for my husband s birthday this weekend really cool lobby bar area with very attentive staff always available great place to have a few drinks in the evening as it was a special occasion we were left a bottle of bubbly in our room with a lovely note the room was fabulous and spotlessly clean although it is central there is no noise from the street would highly recommend this lovely hotel
