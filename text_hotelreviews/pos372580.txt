friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel spotless clean great breakfast that seemed endless good size rooms with comfy beds in a great location not too far away from the ramblas but quiet enough to be just away from the busy streets some great restaurants and bars really close by lovely walk into the centre of town too highly recommend
