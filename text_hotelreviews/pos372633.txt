the hotel is in a modern building located in a nice part of town only blocks to the nearest metro the room was clean very comfortable and had a good shower the furnishings were modern and an electric coffee maker with coffees and teas was provided in the room i d gladly stay here again rooms in barcelona can be expensive so a hotel of this high quality was a good value
