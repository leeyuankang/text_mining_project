i love the quiet of the room from street noise the room appeared although really not to be first time used came with bathrobes the wife loved it and i like the fact that house cleaning doesn t disturb unless you want them too and they are not rushy to get you out but very flexible floors were very clean didn t get a chance for restaurant but maybe next time i am traveling to paris in july maybe perhaps they have the same there already the brochure said it did thanks for a comfortable relaxing stay and the rose was phenomenal great location to major attractions it s on middle of a triangular position of attractions
