just returned from an amazing weekend in barcelona booked a standard double room and was upgraded to a floor suite even without this though i cannot recommend this hotel enough great location away from the hustle and bustle but walkable to las rambles shopping and even walked to sagrada familia the staff in this hotel cannot do enough for you and we cannot wait to return again thank you to all of you at balmes
