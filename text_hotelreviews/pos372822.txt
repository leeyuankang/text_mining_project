the hotel is in a great location for walking places including the metro restaurants hop on hop off bus and gaudi landmarks the single room is tiny but had everything you need to be comfortable including many toiletry items and a comfy bed the garden area with small pool and bar is a pretty and relaxing spot you also receive a ticket to the egyptian museum upon check in which was an added bonus
