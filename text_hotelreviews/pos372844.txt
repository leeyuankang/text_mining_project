very friendly and helpful staff we travelled with our month old baby and his cot was made up for him when we arrived we needed access to a microwave in order to sterilise bottles each evening and this was no problem either the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable location was pretty good lots of places to eat nearby we were advised which nearby metro station had a lift since we had a buggy found it quite difficult to find accommodation in barcelona that wasn t a hostel at one end of the scale or very very expensive at the other so balmes was really a great middle ground
