the staff is very friendly and helpful my request for multiple bills when checking out was handled without a problem the location of the hotel is ideal for tourists you can easily walk to the city center and the most of the subway lines the hotel and rooms are very clean and they get cleaned every day late checkout until pm without additional costs is also a huge plus
