comfy beds liked the little balcony looking out onto the bustle of the barcelona evening only stayed for one night as a stop off to a conference but had a little time in the morning for a wander and this hotel was ideally placed to see gaudi houses and sagrada familia and had an excellent caf nearby for brunch oh and the free cookie at check in was a welcome snack after a long day
