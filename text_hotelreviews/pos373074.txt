we really enjoyed this hotel the staff couldn t have been nicer so very helpful in every way at check in they offered a glass of cava this was a very nice touch we had a great nights sleep on those comfy beds and the breakfast was excellent perhaps a bit pricey but worth it i loved the fact that the products were all local and very delicious a huge assortment of pastries croissants meats and cheeses bonus was the coffee tasted great the staff helped us with the purchase of our tickets to sagrada familia so that we could fast track they also recommended the most incredible seafood restaurant we also enjoyed the park like setting off the dining area it was very pretty
