we loved the look and feel of the hotel from the warm welcome at reception to the modern and well thought out design comfort of the room and the beautiful courtyard where we could sit and relax after a day of touring also i could order a cappuccino and roll for breakfast a la carte without paying the full breakfast price of euros there are various dining options to choose from for dinner too the hotel is well located too we d be happy to stay at the alma again and recommend it highly
