first the staff cannot be beaten they are available and more than happy to help with anything you ask outstanding representatives of this hotel re my rating this hotel is minimalist almost to a fault the lighting is terrible there are no clocks in the rooms no facilities for ice etc i doubt i would stay there again for these reasons
