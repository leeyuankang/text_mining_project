everything was great got a suite v nice and airy clean etc hotel was beautiful modern and professional and lacking the stuffiness of some star spots was in barcelona for the marathon and the restaurant even made up some pasta off the menu for us which was delicious room service and reception could not have been more helpful all very friendly courteous and accommodating gym was fine the swimming pool was a little on the shallow size but did the trick breakfast was very good in terms of food service was fine but not outstanding nice terrace garden off the bar area too i will stay there again next time i m in barca
