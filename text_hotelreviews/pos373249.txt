we booked the hotel the night before we arrived most hotels were fully booked and we did not have a lot of options but it ended up being a good thing the hotel surprised us very positively the location is very nice the bed is really comfortable the staff is kind and always available to help we have a young baby boy and they prepared a crib with blue bedding set and the air conditioning really works not a reality in all hotels in europe
