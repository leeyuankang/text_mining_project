the people on reception were excellant very warm greetings when we arrived always willing to help and give advice and very cheerful erika excuse me if this is the wrong name i m terrible with remembering names was especially helpful offering us a free wi fi egg which was very useful when roaming around the streets giving us good suggestions on where to eat etc the hotel had a great vibe in general and the room which was for three was more spacious than we expected
