loved the d cor colors were vivid but calming sophisticated vibe room was clean with good not great wifi eixample has many nice shops and restaurants and gothic quarter was not too far to walk much quieter and less party oriented area than gothic quarter where we had stayed first with other family hotel is not really near train bus airport but not so far to make it feel inaccessible we walked everywhere including from the hotel to park guell but when checking in and out we felt the need to use taxis to the train and bus station so we didn t drag our luggage so far liked the ice water and apples in the lobby very refreshing room was very quiet
