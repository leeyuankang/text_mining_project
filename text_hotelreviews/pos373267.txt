welcomed by lovely staff maria was just a delight after a long flight was upgraded to spotless modern comfortable room with balcony breakfast excellent great location surrounded by cafes restaurants and beautiful buildings ask for upper floor if street noise bothers you but rooms well insulated expensive but worth it
