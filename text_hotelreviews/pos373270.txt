very welcoming staff thoughtfully designed room central location and breakfast until that s what really counts on a weekend in barcelona this place and the other room mate i ve stayed at in miami beach isn t cheap but it s very good value for money no feeling of regret while settling the bill at check out i also stayed at the w which has better views granted but prefer the room mate carla design wise it achieves modern minimalism without feeling sterile another plus instead of a bible there s a complimentary copy of the un declaration of human rights by the bedside
