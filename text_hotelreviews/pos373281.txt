all the staff were very kind and helpful a special mention for maria nacho and alexander who went out of their way to make our stay so enjoyable the hotel is modern and quirky and spotlessly clean it s in a good location within a five minute walk to the nearest metro there are restaurants nearby and maria recommended an excellent tapas restaurant just a short taxi ride away the hotel doesn t have its own restaurant for evening meals but the breakfast was very good with a good choice of cold meats pastries and hot food
