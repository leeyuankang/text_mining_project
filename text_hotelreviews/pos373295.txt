the hotel has a very good location just mins away from sagrada mins away from paseig de gracia nice personnel ok variety of breakfast the rooms are clean they come and make up the room daily there are amenities and if needed more you can request at the reception free wifi works very good even if you are a couple choose the twin bed rooms as they are superior size than the ones with double bed for a city break of nights i would recommend this hotel
