the location was perfect walking distance from sagrada familia and paseig de gracia really quiet and safe neigborhood we booked the standard room which faces an interior courtyard and gets plenty of daylight but we asked for an upgrade and got the balcony room for euros extra per night this room deserved every extra cent as we could see the sagrada familia and other beautiful buildings from our small balcony the room size is perfect with lots of closet space shelves and hangers the bed was really comfortable with two types of pillow the breakfast was included even though this hotel is cheaper than other hotels in the area the breakfast was surprisingly good not many choices but you could find almost everything you needed the staff was really nice and helpful cool lobby with lovely music and perfume smell
