really interesting building the room we stayed in had a mezzanine floor and would have originally formed part of the old town hall the whole hotel was decorated to a high standard the reception staff were really friendly and helped us with directions to our concert venue as the dlr was part closed our bed was really comfortable and we had a lovely chat over breakfast with one of the owners i assumed he s a nice guy and told us loads about the building and area breakfast was lovely and they could do more for us the horrible events of the shocked ourselves other guests and the staff and we did discuss this over breakfast which was much needed our thoughts are with those who were affected i d like to say thank you to all members of staff who we had the pleasure of meeting and we wish you all well we look forward to returning
