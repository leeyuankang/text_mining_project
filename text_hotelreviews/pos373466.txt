although typical london rooms are on the small size but bathroom very nice with separate bath tub and walk in shower everything very clean and maids are good but unobtrusive turn down service if you want it ac works well generally a nice boutique atmosphere we know london well this location is very good we love sophisticated marylebone high st with all the restos shops etc if you love books visit daunt on the high st quite an icon for fish go to fishworks restaurant try to get into the marylebone back streets lots of atmosphere maybe touristy but if you like the world famous shops and business of oxford st it is a stone s throw away
