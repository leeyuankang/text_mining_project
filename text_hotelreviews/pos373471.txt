we have tried many hotels in the west end over last several years trying to find that balance between location price facilities etc and consider the mandeville passed our expectations we booked a deluxe double room which was very nice although quite compact separate tea coffee facilities safety box bed was very comfortable linen fresh the bathroom was excellent well appointed and large with separate shower and bathtub yes a true bathroom unlike some places which advertise a bathroom but which has no separate bath and is actually just a shower room the ac was excellent and we were able to keep the room cool very important in london in the summer lounge bar was a great venue for pre dinner cocktail or after dinner relaxing staff were all very efficient and friendly overall we were very happy free wifi very good and we did not have to continually re login which can be a real inconvenience in some locales location simply excellent with great pubs dining across wigmore street in st christopher place also along and behind marylebone high street
