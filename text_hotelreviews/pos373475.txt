the bedroom we stayed in was a superior double and was extremely clean and comfortable the shower was excellent and the bed comfortable so that ticked the boxes located where it is just off of st christophers place which is just off oxford street we were able to pick from many excellent restaurants to eat selfridges and other major departmental stores are also within half a mile walk at most and the underground station was a few minutes walk away the hotel has its own restaurant which we did not eat in this time but can recommend from previous visits and the bar is a big advantage after a day spent shopping a big advantage is being able to leave your bags with the concierge after checking out if you need more time in london
