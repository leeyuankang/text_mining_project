i stayed in one of their christian lacroix designed rooms and it was just beautiful it was on the top floor with zero noise the room was beautifully designed in every way and slightly bigger than your standard rooms check in out were super fast and while i know that the hotel is packed it never feels this way on the reception desk or the lifts
