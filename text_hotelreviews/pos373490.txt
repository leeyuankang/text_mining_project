the hotel is comfortable and very clean and in an excellent position the staff were professional yet very helpful and friendly the twin room wasn t very big but it was fine for our needs and the beds were very comfortable we had no trouble with noise and slept really well there are tea coffee making facilities which was nice after a long day my only complaint would be the bathroom door and the towel size i shared the room with my adult daughter and the bathroom door was frosted but really not frosted enough if we hadn t averted our gaze then we would have seen more than enough of each other when taking a shower that wouldn t have been so bad if upon leaving the shower there was a nice big towel to cover up with but we didn t have bath sheets just small bath towels whilst the bathroom is adequate it is very small and so when you step into the shower your backside is on show and when you step out of the shower you end up in a full frontal position right behind the door and there is nowhere to hide ok if you enjoy doing a bit of burlesque can i also say that one of the beds my daughter s was directly facing the door so it really wasn t the best set up for us but probably ok for partners and spouses i would happily stay again if not for this
