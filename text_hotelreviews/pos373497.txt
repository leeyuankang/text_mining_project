well we stayed for nights in the mandeville hotel it was a really great experience reception staff as well as the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful honestly the best ever i met in other hotels the location is good very close to the nice area where shops and restaurants are easy to reach bathrooms are bright and clean housekeeping maintains the rooms twice a day prices were not really high compared to the service and quality you get
