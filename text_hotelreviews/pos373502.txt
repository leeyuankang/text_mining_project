really nice and personal welcome very helpful and they showed attention to us getting a cab helping with the luggage etc my daughter and i had asked for two beds and a quiet room they could not give us separate beds but had made up the bed with two separate covers so they really made an effort and we got a room high up in the building as quiet as possible so i feel very satisfied with the way they solved our demands very comfortable cushions super location next time in london i would book again
