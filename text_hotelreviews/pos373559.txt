this is the fourth time we have stayed at this hotel the location for shopping in the west end is excellent all the major stores are literally within a short walk we had dinner in the hotel s restaurant on one night which was exceptional and reasonably priced and with st christopher s place among others just across the road there is no shortage of excellent restaurants to choose from the reception team were extremely helpful and polite as we were staying on in london on our last day there was no problem looking after our cases on check out great hotel
