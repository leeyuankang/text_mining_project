the mandeville hotel is perfectly situated in westminster london though our stay was a brief overnighter we thoroughly enjoyed the hotels amenities the reception staff were very kind and personable the concierge staff were as helpful as could be no questions asked went unanswered especially regarding sites and attractions of interest to a visitor the on site restaurant staff were equally kind and personable and they served up an excellent dinner with a very nice menu and good wine the breakfast buffet was delicious and quite adequate a great way to begin the day our room was clean comfy and quiet that s really nice when one is travel weary the bed was especially comfortable we will stay here again on a future trip to london and highly recommend to others thanks mandeville you rock
