we honestly loved everything about our stay and even extended it by an extra night as we were having such a lovely time we had a lacroix room which was lovely and quiet super clean and it had a fantastic bathroom and a decent hairdryer the location is perfect for a weekend break no need for taxis or tubes and in addition to being near st christopher s place selfridges and oxford st it is also close to marlybone high st which is quite lovely throughly recommend this hotel and will be returning
