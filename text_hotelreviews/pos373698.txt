in the years we visit london we stayed a couple of times in the mandeville hotel located in marylebone with a bunch restaurants around this hotel is within a minute walk of selfridges and minutes walk to bond street although the location is perfect we booked frequently another hotels the reason was that we got in the past very small rooms we hardly couldn t move in our room one step of everything this time it seemed as the rooms were renovated the rooms are colorfully decorated and we even had a nespresso coffee machine in our room what gives this hotel as well more allure we had a really pleasant stay and what helps the staff is friendly and helpful
