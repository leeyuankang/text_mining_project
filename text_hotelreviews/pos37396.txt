this hotel is in a great location the surrounding area was safe and quiet the eiffel tower is minutes walk away and there s a metro station nearby a perfect base from which to explore paris we received a warm welcome from the beginning and were very pleased with our spacious suite room our flight home was cancelled so we stayed an extra night and the reception staff couldn t have been more accommodating the champagne bar is lovely and it doubles as the breakfast room breakfast was a delicious combination of a baker s basket with lovely fresh pastries and bread fruit and eggs cooked to our preference plenty of coffee too the wee lift is awesome and just one feature of a beautiful hotel
