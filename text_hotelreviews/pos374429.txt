the bed was very comfy nice pillows and the room was very clean there was no air conditioning but there was a fan by the bed which was welcomed it was a nice quiet room at the rear of the property so there was no road noise etc which is great when you are visiting from a village in the middle of nowhere and you are not used to road noise etc
