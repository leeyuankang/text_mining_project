we had a great experience here they had a pack and play set up for our baby when we arrived the room and bathroom were the smallest we have stayed in but it worked i don t think its any smaller than your typical european bathrooms we had a great experience at this hotel we knew exactly what we were getting prior to arrival with no false advertising
