very nice minimalist theme across the hotel they knew i would be arriving and recognised me by my name check in was super quick the room was clean and bright the choice in breakfast was nice the staff was understanding and made an effort to hunt for all things veg on a day i was not supposed to eat non veg their set lunch menus are wholesome too the frontdesk staff helped me with taxi and good tips for getting around the city umbrellas at the reception came handy on one day that was rainy and gaudi s finca g ell entrada del drac is just walking distance all in all very good professional and modern hotel will be my choice i i ever return to barca
