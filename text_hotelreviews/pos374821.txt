upper diagonal was a nice small hotel it isn t too far from the metro and there are shopping centers nearby the facilities are modern the bathroom was especially impressive and was decorated with jet black slate and very spacious ironically there was no bath in our room the bed was comfortable and the staff more than happy to help if and when we had a question our booking also gave us access to an exercise room not much equipment and an umbrella when it rained
