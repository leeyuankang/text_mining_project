absolutely loved this hotel i had a junior suite which was spacious and light with a nicely designed and user friendly dressing area nespresso machine and underfloor hearing in bathroom both great mark at reception went out of his way to accommodate my requests for changes to my booking room and dates of stay hotel is not in main touristy part of town about km out but within a minute or two s walk from u bahn station so super easy having said that i walked most of the time in an attempt to offset the many pastries that s part and parcel of vienna
