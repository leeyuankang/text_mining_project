the falkensteiner hotel wien margareten is a relatively new hotel with clean and modern facilities the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and excellent we stayed for five nights and found the hotel to be conveniently located two blocks from a metro station that was three stations away from the city centre the breakfast buffet was extensive and the quality of the food was excellent our room overlooked the street which was quiet and had a nice outlook but we had to draw the curtains at night as flashes from the tram were like lightening not a problem
