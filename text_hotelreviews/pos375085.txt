that aside the staff were extremely welcoming courteous it was so cold outside this particular week i generally ended up eating my evening meals in the hotel as i had been sightseeing most days and lazily couldn t be bothered to go out again it was very comfortable the sea bass was excellent in fact the course set meal was very good indeed well done chef team i will be returning to this hotel
