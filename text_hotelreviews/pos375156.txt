while entering hotel you have a feeling that it s a club and instinctively rush for other hotel door but you are in place instead of reception bar and full in confusion you are not sure if its a barman or receptionist is in front of you it turned out that it s in they serve and as receptionist and as a barman and always very friendly interior nice modern design but definitely not hotel style hotel feeling starts when leaving elevator but again into long dark corridor decorated with mirrors and small silver lizards like in alice wonderland room spacey modern design nice with a huge bed and tv on the wall what i missed in the room refrigerator safe and cupboard only open shelves instead bathroom nice clean and comfortable designer made opaque window between room and bathroom looks modern and nice but if partner is using wc at night light from it shines directly to the bed well despite it s shortcomings freakish style and design which sometimes miss functionality it s a nice worth trying hotel
