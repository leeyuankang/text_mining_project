everything haha everyone is very helpful i prolonged my stay through booking com because of some relationship issues they didn t need me to change rooms housekeepers are very efficient i was having lunch down there at the lobby when i finished the room is cleaned completely thumbs up for that whats more the decor is all perfect very cyber at the same time elegant which i like about the gym room is very good too for those who likes privacy like me i hide there and work out every time and so far no one jumped in and looked at me in a weird way love the sauna too overall the stars are well deserved
