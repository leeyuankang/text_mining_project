the best thing about this hotel was the breakfast huge variety very fresh and good quality dinner was delicious as well location is not direct central but still not too far from the highlights of the city rooms are spacious and clean cosmetic products of the hotel are very unique and fine sundays is a late check out possible we could stay even until o clock without an additional fee
