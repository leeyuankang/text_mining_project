the hotel is very well located near the westbannof and near subway stations it is on mariahilfer street which has plenty of restaurants and cafes shopping on that street is also excellent breakfast at the hotel was expensive so i didn t use it and instead had breakfast in the street excellent choice of hotel overall and i recommend it
