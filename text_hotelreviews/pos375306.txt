the hotel is well connected with the trams and metro into the city the shopping street is very good and quite busy a billa supermarket across the road if needed the room is comfortable and the cleaners super attentive the free transit pass per person is an excellent and very nice gesture if you arrive via the hauptbahnhof you need to catch tram to westbahnhof to reach the hotel
