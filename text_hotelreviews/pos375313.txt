hotels location is great just minutes to and also because it is near to westbahnhof there is a direct bus to the airport you can walk through mariahilfer stra e to to center in minutes while making a comparison with other hotels fees i added the sum of the price of the transportation tickets we were going to spend to other hotels fees as intercity hotel gives them free and this made an impact on my decision for people days stay as calculating the value of the price rooms were clean and neat overall the hotel seems new
