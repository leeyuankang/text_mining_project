the hotel was very close to the metro station so getting around was extremely easy they also gave us a free travel card as it meant not having to buy tickets for the metro the room was very clean great bathroom and the staff where very helpful as they recommended a great local restaurant that we thoroughly enjoyed didn t need to use an alarm clock as the local church bell went off at am every morning
