the staff were really friendly and helped with recommendations it s worthwhile downloading the app the hotel recommends as it gives you so many suggestions on where to go what to do the roof top bar is a must especially for the view the bottle of wine and handwritten note left was such a nice surprise as i had booked for my husbands the hotel was close to so many cafes and restaurants would definitely go back
