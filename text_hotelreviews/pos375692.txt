we had a wonderful stay in hotel das tyrol mind you the entrance is not on the mariahilferstrasse but just before the corner in the small side street called konigs klostergasse the very high ratings for this hotel are very deserved indeed it really is a very nice hotel with wonderful art inside at every floor the double room was great with a view over the roofs at the back of the hotel on the floor i guess all rooms are very nice but i would probably favour those at the back or breakfast was very good and besides all kinds of things you can order a hot breakfast too it s location is very central close to the main musea the opera house and a bit further the belvedere the staff are just exemplary they did their utmost in advising us were we might find some of the very nice porcelain art displayed all over the hotel we also took the opportunity to relax in the sauna steam room downstairs which we had to ourselves see the really beautiful and perfectly kept sea aquarium we will most certainly be back as two nights the most of three days is really to short to visit vienna thanks to all the wonderful staff
