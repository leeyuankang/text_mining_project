nice boutique hotel right next to the museum quarter every staff member we met was very friendly they took the extra steps to help us enjoy our time in vienna be it providing local knowledge or restaurant bookings excellent facilities and very quiet at night one of the highlights of the hotel is the small booklet with many restaurant recommendations we followed it during the days stay and it never failed
