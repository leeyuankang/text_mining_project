the hotel is located in a really nice shopping area everything i wanted to see was within walking distance or accessible by public transit the staff was very friendly and gave me no trouble about trying to check in early the room was ready and the keys given with a smile they also gave great restaurant recommendations and info on the christmas markets the hotel is nicely decorated clean and the rooms are very comfortable the breakfast buffet served is of good quality and selection
