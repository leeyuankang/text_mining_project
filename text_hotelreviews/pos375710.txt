we had a spacious room with top quality furniture linen bed comfort a modern comfortable bathroom and effective air conditioning climate control breakfast was excellent we enjoyed eggs made to order in addition to a quality continental breakfast staff was friendly and helpful although slightly outside the ringstrasse and inner city the location on mariahilfer was terrific it was very close to a concentration of major attractions including the kunsthistorisches museum the hofburg and the opera house and there is good shopping on mariahilfer close by are good restaurants at reasonable prices our favourite was glacis beisl recommended by the hotel while superficially the hotel doesn t have a particularly impressive frontage viewed from the street in substance we found it provides a high quality experience at a reasonable price
