where to start from the moment we arrived everything was great the reception staff gisela melanie and nadine were all lovely on arrival we were given a very useful map that gave very good transport information too it was great to help us get around gisela noticed from my passport that it was my birthday the day after we arrived we arrived back from our day out to find a lovely fruit flan waiting for us wi fi in the hotel is free and i found the reception to be excellent our room was amazing with everything catered for including a nespresso coffee machine there were chocolates on the pillow each evening and we were given some as a souvenir as we left i don t think i have ever seen such a well stocked mini bar there were plenty of hangers in the wardrobe so we could actually hang up all our clothes this is in my experience rather rare breakfast was very good great selection of cheese cold meat pate salads pastries cereals fresh fruit and yoghurt scrambled boiled or fried eggs could be ordered and omelettes were also available the hotel is situated a short walk from the u station so we found it very easy to travel around the city it is on a restricted mainly pedestrianised road so there was no noise in fact the hotel was very quiet air conditioning was fantastic too and so needed during our stay we had a lovely little private balcony so we could sit with a cuppa and watch the world go by there were free slippers and the use of a bathrobe throughout the hotel were examples of varying types of artwork from paintings to glasswork to pottery we would very definitely stay here again if we revisit vienna which we fully intend to do
