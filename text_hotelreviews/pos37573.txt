the reception staff in particular could not do enough for you it was a pleasure to have met reception concierge staff so knowledgable friendly and courteous these people made our day stay fantastic a special thanks to sophie we have stayed in many star hotels throughout the world but the terrass hotel staff topped the lot the large chain hotels especially can take a lesson from the terrass hotel i have been gm in star hotels and now feel that i could have done much more to have made guests happy restaurant staff also were very good professional and friendly
