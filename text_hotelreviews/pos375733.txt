the hotel is really cozy and nice it had everything we needed for a short city break excellent location near the shopping street and city center very friendly staff excellent breakfast with custom made ham and cheese omelette plus home made croissants and pastry spa area with saunas you can book privately without any extra fee were highlights to our long days of shopping and visiting sightseeings we highly recommend this hotel
