our original room was fine but we found a problem with the bathroom and when we mentioned it to the reception staff they immediately sorted us out with an upgrade room which was wonderful all the staff were brilliant in particular stefanie pravida nothing was too much trouble and we got a lovely surprise when they sent us some fruit water as an apology we had a lovely experience at this hotel
