we very much enjoyed the location of the hotel close to the main attractions and also close to public transportation the room was extremely quiet as we requested and the view was very nice through the inner courtyard with green walls and sounds of blackbirds the minibar and the kettle were really useful we also appreciated that the room was cool even if outside the weather was extremely hot the staff was very nice and polite breakfast is assorted with multiple possibilities for the vegetarians
