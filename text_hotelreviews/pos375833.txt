we booked the room for nights the hotel was located in the center of vienna the metro station was just below the hotel s entrance the personell was very polite the room was very clean and the towels were changed daily the bed was double large and very comfortable just like we have asked for it we ve asked for a double bed not two single beds attached i will definitely prefer it again in my next visit to vienna
