the hotel is very tidy easy to reach by metro in the centre of vienna s shopping life which was especially important the breakfast was brilliant i especially liked the variety of viennoiserie jams smoothies cheese and the impeccable frothy melange an electric teapot was a great advantage one more important thing it was really quiet no noise heard either from neighbours or from outside
