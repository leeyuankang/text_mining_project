the only good thing about this hotel is the location otherwise is far from being a hotel it was more like a rooms look very old and dirty the furniture is broken the bathroom had mold it was very annoying that the room was heated by an ac and that was broken we stayed with a baby inside the room for two nights we were freezing even though we complained about it at the reception they did not fix it they brought us a heater which wasn t working as well would never choose this hotel again
