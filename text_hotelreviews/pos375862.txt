it was our fourth time in this hotel we keep returning to this place for a number of reasons the rooms have a separate living room which is very convenient with children you can put them to sleep in their usual bedtime and enjoy something to eat or drink or just watch tv without disturbing them location is perfect it is right on mariahilferstrasse which means that shops bars and restaurants are all within walking distance metro station is right outside of the hotel
