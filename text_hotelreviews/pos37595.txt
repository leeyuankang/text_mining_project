this hotel is every bit as good as it looks and sounds from the website we stayed for two nights and it was beyond comfortable a short walk to a hub of great restaurant bars and amenities slightly busy road out the front but double glazing keeps the noise out mostly and the air can works a treat i don t think i ve ever had a better view for breakfast and the food matched the views quality a really great hotel with friendly staff who speak good english highly recommend
