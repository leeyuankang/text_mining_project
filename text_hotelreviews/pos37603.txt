the staff was phenomenal they were all incredibly helpful i didn t get the name of the man who helped me when i checked in but he was very kind and friendly i arrived on my own with my daughter due to join me later on saturday evening unfortunately her flight was delayed hours which caused her to miss her connecting flight in copenhagen so she didn t arrive in paris until sunday the staff took pity on us since she missed one of her two nights in paris and upgraded us to a rooftop room with an amazing view of the eiffel tower so i enjoyed the wonderful view the first night and we both loved it for the second night there is also a rooftop bar and restaurant with a similar view the breakfast was very substantial it wasn t included in the room rate that we arranged but it can be part of a package it was worth the cost there was a fairly new staff member by the name of pierre antoine who was incredibly helpful with directions and i m directionally challenged with suggestions for dining etc the hotel was very modern sleek and clean we loved our stay at terrass and would definitely recommend it
