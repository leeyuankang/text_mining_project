i liked almost everything from check in to check out i am sorry i cannot say the name of the owner because it is difficult for me but he was an amazing and professional person the hotel is very clean and quiet and the room was big clean and comfortable with mini bar and coffee machine the location was a hit in the heart of mariahilfarstrasse a kino cinema is next to the hotel everything is handy in the area shops pharmacies cafe restaurants etc places of interest like cathedrals and museums were within a walking distance the staff catered for my questions and requests very well i highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again
