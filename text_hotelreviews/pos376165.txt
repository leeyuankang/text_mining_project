location was superb next to underground station and in the middle of the decent market where you are comfortable with your family roaming around we have booked the apartment and it had no issues the thing we liked the most was staff at reception despite we asked a lot of questions multiple times but they were very gentle and helpful to us even room service staff was very good would highly recommend this to others we would definitely stay here again if possible
