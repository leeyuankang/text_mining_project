we had a fantastic stay at the terrass hotel montmartre although we did not have a room with a view of the eifel tower we still enjoyed the view along the street and across to the montmartre cemetery the room was clean modern and spacious the breakfast was lovely and a good choice for all tastes and worth the price to enjoy the view of the eifel tower and paris make sure you at least have a drink in the terrass bar after dark to see the eifel tower lights on the hour the hotel is in an ideal area close to the restaurants shops and abbesses metro we hope to go back soon
