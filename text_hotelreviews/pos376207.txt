we re a family of four and stayed three nights in a family room the room had a big bed pull out sofa and a very small efficiency kitchen area it was comfortable and clean this hotel was ok and we had no issues but it just felt very sterile and impersonal a decent place to shower and sleep then get out and enjoy all that vienna has to offer
