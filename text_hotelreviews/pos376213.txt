spacious clean room large room divided by partial partition bed one side couch and table the other with a flat screen tv that swivelled in the partition to be viewed from either side breakfast small but comprehensive and fresh selection of parties meats cheese some hot items etc replenished frequently excellent especially the roof top outdoor area on a nice sunny day very quiet quietest hotel room that i have ever stayed in staff were customer facing and very helpful worth saying that this hotel does not have a bar plenty of options for bars restaurants nearby nor a large reception seating area did not cause us a problem as we were out and about and on the go a lot
