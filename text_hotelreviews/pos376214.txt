due to its perfect location at mariahilfer strasse the hotel is a good choice for a weekend or business trip nice clean and bright rooms courtyard facing are very quiet and junior suites offer much space the view from the breakfast room on floor is stunning i liked the huge bathroom with an efficient hair dryer
