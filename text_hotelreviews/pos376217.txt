the hotel location is great on the shopping street of vienna very easy access to metro and just a walking distance to the historical attractions the rooms are spacious and very clean these are one of the most comfortable beds we ve ever slept the breakfast is rich in variety of food and delicious the lady at the reception was corteous and very helpful a pleasure to talk to her since we have visited other hotels from this brand in other cities before our first choice if possible when booking is a hotel form nh brand if available in the city this hotel met all our expectations and our stay was really fantastic we will definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting vienna and will reccommend it to our friends
