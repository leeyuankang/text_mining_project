location is very good close to museums quartier m away from u station room to the inside park that we had was very quiet modern design newly decorated in a minimalist stile staff of the hotel handled very well a small issue that we had at check in breakfast is one of the best in hotels wide range of food bio products and a beautifull roof terrace where you can go out with your caffe for a beautifull view even in winter
