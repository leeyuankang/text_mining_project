i loved the area gracia and the property was in a fairly quiet street it was close to the centre and the metro was only minutes walk away stops to plaza catalunya the room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable so i enjoyed a very relaxing few days as i was in barcelona for the football it was a lovely walk to the camp nou approximately minutes walk along the avenida diagonal i have finally found a place i would return to and the added bonus of simple kitchen facilities was a bonus as was a small balcony staff were very friendly and very helpful which is a huge plus
