we stayed in a suite at the club level which was luxurious and beautiful amazing panoramic view comfortable bed and very spacious the club room just down the hall was fantastic they had a lovely breakfast spread and the variety of snacks they put out throughout the day was impressive complimentary drinks were a nice touch at the club as the price for bar drinks is pretty astronomical at any other bar or restaurant along the beach or elsewhere in the hotel for that matter staff couldn t have been more accommodating would definitely stay there again
