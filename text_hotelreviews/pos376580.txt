room was very luxurious and the view from our room across the city was out of this world we were given a room on floor so ask for a high floor if you want great views we were right next to the port and beach so the location was fantastic the bus tour stop is a stones throw away and taxis are always available it s a really great spot the staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble they were very professional and very friendly and on hearing we were celebrating a special birthday they sent up some cava and some lovely cakes we would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends and we would love to stay again on our next visit
