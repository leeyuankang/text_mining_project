the hotel was conveniently located a short walk from the metro station the room was excellent i was lucky enough to stay in a suite which was extremely well appointed clean and comfortable the breakfast offered was excellent with a wide choice of foods on offer at the self service buffet the staff were very helpful the only negative aspect was the noise from traffic on the adjacent busy highway however with the windows closed and aircon on there was no particular issue all in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel which offers fantastic value for money
