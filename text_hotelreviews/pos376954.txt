the hotel leonardo was easy to find just a small walk from westbanhof on the one of the main transport links the staff were unbelievably helpful from the start offering advice on places to visit or local knowledge about where to eat our room was very comfortable the washing facilities were particularly nice and some forgotten toiletries were offered by the hotel on request the hotel bar was a nice last stop after a day out and again staffed by very friendly people look out for micheal if you visit yourself all in all a very nice place to stay slightly out from the center of vienna itself
