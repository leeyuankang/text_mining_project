the staff were absolutely wonderful they safely stored out luggage as we explored the city as we arrived very early in the day when i complained that the bed was two smaller beds put together i fell through it and hurt my knee the front desk person immediately changed my husband and me to another room with a different bed he was very nice about it and we appreciated not having to argue about it they also stored our luggage on the day of our check out until our flight in the evening every interaction with the staff was met with a smile the location was wonderful too the westbanhof bus took us right from the airport to across the street from the hotel and the same for the return to the airport we were within walking distance miles for us of most of what we wanted to see and the close proximity to public transport made venturing further easy too the floor relaxation room was lovely not exactly enough equipment to call it a gym but nice none the less the view from it was great to see the city and the sitting area was a nice touch
