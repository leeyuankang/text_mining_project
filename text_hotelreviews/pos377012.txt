the staff were really helpful with information and bookings we had an early check out before breakfast room was open and they organised a bag with bread rolls fruit and juice to take to the airport i think the lady at reception was called daniella we found her ever so helpful the room was clean and comfy and the bed and pillows were great the location of the hotel is brilliant a lovely minute walk through a shopping street to the centre or the metro stop is very close to the hotel
