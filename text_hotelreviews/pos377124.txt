this hotel is well located the shopping area and metro and train stations are so nearby the rooms are small but clean and well designed parking is also available around the area so our friends were able to visit us easily breakfast had a lot of choices and priced reasonably from our hotel we actually walked to many of the sites in vienna we started walking through the shopping area in mariahilfe all the way to most sites in the first and second district i asked for a room with a view and i was not disappointed view as you can see from the picture is great
