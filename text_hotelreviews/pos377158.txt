excellent location by the train station you don t want to be carrying your luggage all around town and look like a tourist so being across the street was key for us good size room for the money breakfast was tasty and had normal food the staff speak very fluent english and were super helpful when we asked about the sights to see and how to get there definitely great quality for the money i will tell my friends to stay there when they visit
