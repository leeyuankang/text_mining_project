the location decor comfort and staff were all excellent walking distance of many interesting attractions and shopping but a step away food was very good the evening we ate in and we enjoyed an apero in the bar by the fire a number of times because it was so comfortable tea and coffee facilities in the room were very welcome lovely stay and we would happily book there again
