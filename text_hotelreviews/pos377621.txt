staff are friendly and helpful like the atmosphere of the hotel warm and welcoming room is clean most hotels here do not provide kettle and this is one of them but can get hot water from the cafe and the staff are always so willing to help thumb up hotel is not centrally located but accessible via metro nearby came back late one night and still feel safe when walking back to the hotel
