the hotel was very nice looking upon arrival and the staff was very friendly it was a little hard to find with construction going on around but didn t affect our experience the room was big and a crib was provided for our little one bed comfortable and within minutes walking distance to public transportation very clean would stay again didn t get to try the breakfast you can park for free on the street or pay for hours in their parking garage
