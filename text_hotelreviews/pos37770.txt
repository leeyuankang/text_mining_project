great location a nice hotel in a lovely old building classically decorated very french with lovely furniture and classic prints of beautiful paris buildings etc close to metro train stations and the river the room was clean the bed was very comfortable interior room so no street noise no view either but for an overnighter view didn t matter the price for location and type of hotel was good
