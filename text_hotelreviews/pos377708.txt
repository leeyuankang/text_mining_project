we stayed at jufa for the or time we enjoy the cleanliness and the very helpful and friendly staff the hotel is very secure and besides the little inconveniences there is no fridge in the room for example but you would expect that as it is a star hotel this hotel is great for a trip inviena the metro station is very close min walking distance
