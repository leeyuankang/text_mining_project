absolutely wonderful hotel great for children of all ages the neighborhood is quiet and the hotel is minutes away from the u bahn which means that it s minutes away from the center of vienna staff was lovely rooms were very clean breakfast and dinner were plentiful if we go to vienna again we would definitely stay at jufa
