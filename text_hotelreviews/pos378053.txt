the hotel and the service were lovely the hotel however was a long way out of town it was costly by taxi the transit was great if you are comfortable with new adventures there were not a lot of places to eat nearby the hotel has some food service but does not serve alcohol there is a park right near that hotel that is wonderful to walk in we really loved it
