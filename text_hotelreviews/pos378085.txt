outside didn t look much but inside it was beautiful with good attentive staff automated check in seemed unnecessary as everybody seemed to need help but it was efficiently dealt with excellent breakfast parking looked secure and felt safe little walk to train station but pleasant area and surprisingly quiet as near major road links excellent well done
