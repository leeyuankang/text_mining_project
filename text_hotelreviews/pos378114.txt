very friendly and accommodating staff they were extremely chatty helpful and very welcoming to us we arrived earlier than the check in time but to our great surprise the room was ready for us which made two tired travellers very happy the hotel is ideally located right beside the tram stop which was excellent to access the city and the airport it is also right beside a beautiful large park where you can cycle walk in and the hotel rents out bikes i would highly recommend renting the bikes and cycling in the park it was one of our holiday favourites also liked the nespresso machine in the bedroom the room itself was nice really liked the shower and bathroom the tv has english channels which is always an advantage non drug policy and no smoking in the rooms is a big plus considering it is in amsterdam rooms are sound proof and there was no noise in the hallways or from any other rooms lidl is also only around the corner
