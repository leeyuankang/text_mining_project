we were a group of one adult and two teenagers we followed the directions on the website from the airport to the hotel catching a train which was so easy we were going to catch a tram for one stop but decided to walk the mins straight road to the hotel and this was fun and meant we got to see amsterdam straight from the station the room we had was a triple which was large and the shower room was modern clean and with plenty of towels and toiletries the staff could have been a bit more helpful as i had to ask for a map and details of how to use the trams and buses after prompting they were accommodating great selection at the buffet breakfast which had something for everyone and an egg station where you could choose what you wanted to be made fresh
