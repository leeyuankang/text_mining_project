great location tram station directly in front of hotel making it convenient to get anywhere from there minutes to all locations by tram yet far enough away to be quiet our room was extremely comfortable and well furnished very clean loved the bathroom amenities especially the heated floor we would have been lost without the help of the super friendly front desk
