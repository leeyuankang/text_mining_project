we spent only one night and it was ok the restaurant had a lot of diners but only stuff members on king day so we wound up waiting for minutes for chips and pizza the kids were getting very impairment so we decided that enough is enough we asked the waiter to bring the food to our room when its ready one more thing the water current in the bath was terrible other then that the stay was fitting and comfortable
