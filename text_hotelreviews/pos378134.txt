although this hotel is outside the center the tram stops right out in front and it is easy to get to the center of amsterdam being outside the center it is quiet and has a park across the street the buffet breakfast is very extensive and worth paying extra for book in advance for the discount the room was large we did not pay extra for a comfort room bathroom was huge with a heated tile floor lots of counter space and a large shower very clean an modern the front desk people were so helpful if you have questions especially about travelling on the tram they are very helpful wait until there isn t a long line to check in or out and they take as much time as you want
