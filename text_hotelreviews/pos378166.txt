didn t eat at the restaurant but did have the breakfast buffet it was excellent hotel room was spacious and looked just like the pictures bed was very comfortable hotel staff was very nice and helpful hotel was about feet from the tram stop so convenient the hotel room was very quiet i would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if i travel back to amsterdam
