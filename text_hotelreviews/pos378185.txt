clean room comfy beds good location with easy access to the city centre with a tram stop outside that also gives easy access to the airport we bought a train and tram pass which was significantly cheaper than getting a taxi ride to the hotel so would definitely recommend public transport hotel breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly and accommodating
