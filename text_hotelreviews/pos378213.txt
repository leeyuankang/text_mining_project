the lady at reception that checked us in was exceptional great humour and great english hotel is beautifully clean and well laid out our room was spacious spotless well equipped and beautifully decorated bathroom was also amazing especially the shower location is great only ten to fifteen minutes to city centre would highly recommend and will be back the hotel is non smoking and serves no alcohol which didn t bother us in the slightest it was nice to be in an alcohol free area for once taxis always available outside the door
