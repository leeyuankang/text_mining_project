the hotel was a bit far from the center but the tram stop was outside the hotel the rooms were clean but we asked for double bed and we had singleones put together instead the breakfast worth the money as if you go to have breakfast somewhere else you will pay aproxim the same amount they had a smoking area wich is a plus but alla the drinks where non alcoholic we had couple of times issue with our keys as we couldnt open the door but the reseption was overall we enjoyed our stay
