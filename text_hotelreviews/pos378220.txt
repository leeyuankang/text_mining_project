the location of the hotel was quite nice the bus station is very close the tram passes right in front of you the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the bathroom in the room was one of the most beautiful bathrooms i ve ever seen when we first entered the room there was a problem in the shower and immediately changed our room i will definitely stay at this hotel if i come back to amaterdam again
