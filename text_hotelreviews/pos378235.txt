the photos do not do the hotel justice the hotel looks way better in real life i loved the bathroom the shower is wide and clean and very modern too the shower head is powerful and the water temperature is great the beds are comfortable you have a good selection of tv channels including an urban music channel there s a coffee shop close by and the tram stop outside to get to central the staff were cool i enjoyed it
