rooms great size really nice and good for relaxing after a long day in the city travel pass is a must we got a day pass and it allowed us to get the train trams metro and bus around the city the public transport is so easy to navigate and the hotel staff we more than helpful with directions i was slightly apprehensive about how far out of the city the hotel was before we arrived however it turned out to be closer than expected and we were happy to be staying a little out of the way for some peace on our final day we asked at reception to print our boarding passes they were really helpful and directed us to a computer room with printer to use free of charge in a lovely lounge we opted out of breakfast but will try this next time we stay as it looked great we are already planning on booking a return trip don t be put off by any negative reviews this is a great hotel
