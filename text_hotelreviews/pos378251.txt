the rooms were fantastic size and the rainfall shower head was amazing beds were the most comfortable i ve ever slept in at a hotel and although we were facing the busy highway there was no noise whatsoever which was amazing great having a posh coffee machine the location was a bit far out but once we d got the hang of the tram lines it was easy to reach very easy to get back to the airport too staff were extremely helpful and helped us with trams etc
