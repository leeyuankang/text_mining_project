staff were all amazing and very friendly and helpful we had some issues with the heating in our room and when the lady from reception couldn t fix it herself she called out an engineer who fixed it within an hour she then told us we could have a complimentary breakfast the next morning for our troubles when we visited the restaurant for dinner one evening and the menu looked a little fancy for our kids the gentleman told us we could order the pizza from the room service menu and eat it in the restaurant they really do go out of their way to ensure you are happy and comfortable the hotel itself is beautiful and spotlessly clean i would definitely stay there again
