very prestige hotel welcoming and polite staff members the location is good as you only need a to take trams to amsterdam central making it very easy to get there tram stop is across the road from the hotel no issues at all i d definitely recommend and come back to here i came with a group of my friends for my birthday and we all had an amazing time here in amsterdam also on train and tram from schipol airport it isn t very far
