we loved this hotel location was not far from all of the action especially with the tram stop right next the hotel beautiful place to stay with plenty of common area to relax with friends that we were traveling with and also multiple computers to use free of charge onsite restaurant and bar was convenient room was very clean and modern with all of the features you need even had a nespresso coffee maker for that early morning espresso fix
