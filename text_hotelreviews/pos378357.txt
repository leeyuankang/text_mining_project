great location and the price was fantastic i would absolutely stay here again it had easy access to the any part of the city with the tram line the hotel is also easy to drive to i had a slight room key issue which was my fault i thought the door lock was broken but it turned out i left the door ajar the front desk was very accomodating and sent a maintenance person up right away
