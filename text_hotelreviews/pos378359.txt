the bed was unbelievably comfortable for a standard room booking i was expecting either a small double bed or singles pushed together i was over the moon when i walked into the hotel room to see how spacious it was and the bathroom but the bed was unreal so comfortable and huge the tram stop is right outside the hotel and by taking tram stops to adm de ruijterweg and then taking tram it takes you right to the city centre in less than minutes the staff there are great and answered all my queries it was a fantastic stay for the money
