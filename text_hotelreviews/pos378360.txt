location was handy mins taxi from the city centre and mins the other way to the airport staff were very helpful and knowledgeable on local tourist attractions restaurants etc price was a little raw considering breakfast wasn t included but it forced us to see more of the city and we found some deadly little cafes and coffee shops as a result so it was grand
