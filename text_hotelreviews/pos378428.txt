we stayed with small children teenager and elderly parents and we all enjoyed our stay great location very easy to jump on to tram and get into city centre staff were always helpful we had different room types and they were all large modern and very clean has a great lounge area we used to meet in or to hang out and play cards in beds are super comfortable
