very good value for money buffet breakfast deal and an excellent self service with the most choices i have seen anywhere to add to all of this a very attentive waiting staff the tram to downtown one way and to the train station to the airport the other way is a huge plus when reception found out that we had come all the way from new zealand a free upgrade to one of the huge corner double rooms was a very nice touch a very quiet modern and clean hotel highly recommended
