the whole hotel was lovely well decorated and inviting rooms were cleaned daily including fresh towels complementory toiletries in the room and the bed was extremely comfortable our room was available before check in time and staff were very friendly and helpful explaining which trams to use along with providing maps we found the location absolutely fine given we spent the majority of our time in the centre probably minutes travel time in total via trams computers were available to use for free so we could print our boarding passes off did not have breakfast or use the restaurant but i can imagine it would be lovely given the standards of the rest of the hotel will be returning
