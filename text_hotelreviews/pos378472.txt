hotel has a good location with easy access to both airport and tourist area the team stops right in front of the hotel the rooms are clean and suprisingly large the room with double beds they were queen size beds was easily able to accommodate our family of adults and kids and very clean facilities value for money was good during the week but the price increased drastically for the weekend breakfast was very good
