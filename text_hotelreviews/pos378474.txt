this location is minutes away from the city center by tram yes the tram stops in front of the hotel but for visiting various places we had to make change and it took us a good hour to reach our destination the front desk was not friendly at all when we checked in and since there were people staying in one room and there was only one set of towel we called and asked for more towels we were told to go and get it ourselves i made this booking well in advance and were given first floor rooms facing the taxi and tram station right above the bar needless to say the noise did not make us happy
