i enjoyed the free upgrade to comfort room the bedroom was very comfortable and together with a firm mattress made for a good nights sleep the room was clean and finished to a very high standard the bathroom was immaculate and contained a lovely walk in shower the staff were very friendly and helpful and i would stay again on account of its location and its transport links
