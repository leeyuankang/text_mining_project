great coffee machine in the room and nice buffet dinner at the hotel restaurant quiet location had its advantages for our purposes in that it was close to the sloderdijk train station but out of the hustle and bustle of being near the amsterdam central station we spent our days in netherlands going to some other towns haarlem and delft west of amsterdam so the location worked fine for that and it was still a quick min direct trip between sloderdijk station to the airport
