this hotel was in a great location only mins to the city and a tram was just outside the door we found our way from the airport to the hotel by train and tram quite easily its friendly and has a good breakfast on offer however make sure to take up the offer of booking for a breakfast when checking in as the price goes up slightly if you go in for breakfast the next day
