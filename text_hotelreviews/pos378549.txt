the hotel is located a bit outside of the center which was really nice coz you re outside the noise and hassle of the city we were really surprise that we didn t have a hard time in reaching and looking for the property it was a min ride with the train from the airport to station sloterdeijk and from there we walked to the hotel it wasn t really far mins walk with our luggage you can also take a tram from the train station which is only a stop away the tram stop molenwerf is right in front of the hotel we booked a comfort double room which was really very comfortable the room was big and it had the all the necessary little things you might need from sleepers to nail files they had a nespresso machine in the room and an iron and ironing board too which made our trip extra comfortable we also had breakfast in the hotel everyday and costs per person per day which was really not bad they had a very good spread for breakfast on our first night we had the dinner buffet wich costs per person including drinks it might be a bit pricy for some but considering that all drinks are included is not really bad at all we ll definitely stay again in this property on our next trip to amsterdam and is highly recommended for those who wants to explore the amsterdam during the day and have some quiet and relaxing time in the evening
