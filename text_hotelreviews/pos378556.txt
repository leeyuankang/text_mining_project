we were so pleasantly surprised to get a big comfy corner room with lots of windows we actually got the room described in the deal and in the photos because sometimes the descriptions can be misleading the hotel had great and helpful staff too location was close to and only walking distance from the train station so it s super easy to catch the train to faster and cheaper than bus and taxi hotel was only min tram ride away from city center so if you prefer a hotel in a quiet neighborhood i d recommend this one nearest tram stop is right across the street too
