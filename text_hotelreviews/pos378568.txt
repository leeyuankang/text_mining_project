the evening buffet and breakfast buffet were were a mixture of continental and asian cuisine which were excellent plus a discount if booking dinners before pm the staff was very efficient and very helpful our room was clean and facilities were updated tram stop directly outside the hotel door was so convenient it is a very quiet part of town and close to the airport as well
