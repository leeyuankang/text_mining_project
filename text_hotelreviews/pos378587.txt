the room was extremely clean and very spacious we travelled with children and stayed in the family room the breakfast was amazing you could literally choose from anything the staff on the desk were extremely helpful more than willing to advise us on where to go and how to get there not to mention making our check in and out very easy we could also leave our bags after check out until we were ready to head back to the airport which was very useful
