the room was gorgeous very generous size with all the amenities the double bed was extremely comfy and the hotel had also give us a room with a really good view as requested which was lovely the hotel staff were extremely friendly welcoming and helpful advising us on the best places to eat and drink and also providing us with discounted tram fares and tourist excursions although the hotel is outside of the city centre it is situation right next to one of the main tram lines that take you into the centre and are easy to navigate to and from the hotel also provided us with directions on how to get to certain places i e dam square and what trams to change i would highly recommend staying at this hotel although the restaurant is a little pricey the bar provideds snacks and nibbles which delicious i would and will probably be coming back to the golden tulip again
