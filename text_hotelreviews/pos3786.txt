room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound they gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free internet and free calls over the europe and north america it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in paris staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on it is litterally from arc de triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay euro to get on top of it and you can see a paris from there its absolutely beutiful metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about but it can bring you anywhere really nice location highly recommended
