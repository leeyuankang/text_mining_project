the staff at the hotel were so lovely and we were greeted so kindly on the first day the ladies at the front desk spoke really good english which made sorting out the payments for the rooms much easier she also gave us a map and showed us destinations she thought we may like to visit our room was on the smaller side but it was decorated so nicely our friends were in rooms just opposite and theres were much larger the shower in the bathroom was amazing and all the facilities were up to a high standard of cleanliness we had our rooms cleaned nights and they would look immaculate each time originally we were going to stay in a hotel with a similar name which was blue the blue water or something like that but after reading the reviews online we changed to this one would definitely recommend to anyone who is going on their first trip as there is a tram number which stops just a minute walk from the hotel and you only have to change over once onto the at bos den lommerweg in order to get to dam square you can also buy tram tickets and other tourist attraction tickets at the front desk but they can sell out so if you can buy your tram tickets at the actual station i would do that instead the buffet there was amazing and they had such a large variety of food from ice cream to sushi overall our experience there was amazing and i will definitely be coming again on my next trip to amsterdam
