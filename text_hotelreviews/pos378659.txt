roel who is awesome accommodated me with an early check in which was very much appreciated after a long flight the hotel itself is lovely the room was spacious and clean the fact that there is an enormous dining room for both buffet breakfast and dinner as well as a bar for lunch and drinks is convenient the hotel is about a minute walk from city center but there are trams running constantly that will take you anywhere you want to go the train station is a minute walk and the airport is also quite close for me another major plus was that there is a vegan restaurant just a minute walk from the hotel overall a great value and an excellent choice for an extended stay
