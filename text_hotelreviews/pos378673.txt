had a triple room for only one night as we laid over in amsterdam on a return trip from spain it had plenty of room for us and would be comfortable for longer stays what i liked most about the room was the heated bathroom floors and the shower head room had a machine to fix coffee or hot water for tea something we didn t have in spain great italian restaurant across the street by the tram stop for half the price as the dinner buffet hotel is only an minute walk to the sloterijk train station
