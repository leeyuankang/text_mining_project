the room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure also there was an usb outlet as well as v outlet what was a nice bonus the mini bar had quite nice selection of drinks and snacks and the cost was less than in most of the restaurants also needs to be mentioned that we had a view of the top of the eiffel tower
