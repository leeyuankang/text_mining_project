i love french hotels there is always something funny or strange and there is always an element that challenges my improvisation skills the waldorf madeleine did not disappoint in that way wanting to take a shower i accidently converted the bathroom in a pool as the design of the showerhead and how it was mounted could not lead to any other results this time my improvisation skills did not provide a solution i was baffled by this piece of french ingenuity on shower design the other challenge a window that did not close was solved by using the hotel directory in a new and different way my hunger for improvisation was satisfied furthermore the hotel is on a great location the bed was very nice and good and the airco is powerful so on hot days you ll still be able to recreate the inside of a fridge should you like
