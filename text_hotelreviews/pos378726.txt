very helpful front desk staff who helped with the aid of a map to provide us with directions to the tram and places to see excellent service great rooms a little tired the evening buffet was amazing and the selection of food outstanding this was scored a zillion out of from my year old overall a great experience and would definitely come back to the hotel and area again
