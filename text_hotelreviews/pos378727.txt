stayed at the hotel for nights with a group of friends for a birthday celebration the hotel itself was perfect very modern and immaculate everyday staff were also very helpful in directing us to the correct transport for areas of amsterdam we wished to visit we didn t eat at the hotel but the restuarant looked fantastic although we did have drinks in the lounge bar at reasonable prices great environment definitely stay again if ever returned to amsterdam or recommend to friends family
