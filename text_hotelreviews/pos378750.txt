the hotel was of a lovely standard staff were very helpful with any questions we had we had arrived early and our room was ready which was amazing the hotel is two teams away from the centre however this suited us as we like to be away from noise and the reception were happy to tell us which stops to use and we bought tickets from there as well in fact going on the trams added to our experience
