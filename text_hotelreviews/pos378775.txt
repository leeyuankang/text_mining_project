we had a lovely stay at the golden tulip from the moment we checked in until the moment we left the hotel is comfortable and stylish and i cannot fault it at all we had lovely rooms next door to each other the d cor was really nice and the rooms clean we loved the nespresso coffee machines and complimentary toiletries and the tv had lots of channels also a british plug socket in each room is very thoughtful the free wi fi was fabulous and it was great that you didn t have to keep logging in i was able to print my boarding passes in the lounge on the free computer and printer facility the lounge and business area downstairs was lovely and always very calm the bar had warm friendly staff and was a pleasure to use we didn t need to trouble the reception staff much as everything we needed was provided for anyway but we did purchase daily tram tickets which was very handy staff also provided us with a map and tram directions the hotel is ideally situated a little out of town but just a short tram ride away and is conveniently located for sloterdjike train station if i am ever fortunate enough to visit amsterdam why would i choose to stay anywhere else
