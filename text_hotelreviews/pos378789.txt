staff very friendly and helpful rooms spacious and quiet wifi worked brilliantly bar was nice to relax in sorted out my booking of two rooms even though prior to my arriving had been staying my kids had to stay in a separate room as there were no triples available once they saw me they had no problems with us staying in one room
