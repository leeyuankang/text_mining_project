the hotel has an understated entrance but once you walk through the doors you know you booked the right hotel the concierge staff is great we were treated by marc in a staff of stars he was the superstar they can direct you to all the sights by highlighting a tourist map for you the hallways to get to the rooms are maze like but quintessentially european city the rooms are great nice modern bathroom big waredrobe comfortable bed we had a front facing room and had a balcony over the street magnifique didn t have breakfast at hotel but peeked in during service it looked delightful
