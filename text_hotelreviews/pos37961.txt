everything was wonderful especially the reception staff i was in the same hotel in and it was wonderful but i m seeing now is the finest because the furniture and decor and the bathroom everything was new and even the elevator seemed to me a broader i have to thank all the crew reception for the proper dealings and cooperation with me during my ten days stay i would like to say that i intend to residence time and again for this hotel distinctive and near everything to its location in the heart of the french capital paris
