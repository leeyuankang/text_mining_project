very good if viziting the city by car or coming to the conference in world trade center met a really big que on the reception spend about half an hour in it which happened to me for the fisrt time in my life the lobby bar offers very nice snacks but the service is not very fast the funny thing is that the second day i had my lunch with my friend for free as the waiter told us that they were too slow to serve us a whole lunch in the restaurant for free also happened for me for the first time
