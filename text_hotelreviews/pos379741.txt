the room was very spacious loved the private dressing room the balcony was very nice although i expected a direct ocean view but it was partially seen the service was excellent i have seen only few hotels who are really clean and concerned about their cleaning service and this one was one of them the location is really good it was only minutes walking to la rambla street i would definitely visit again the in room service breakfast is good and healthy
