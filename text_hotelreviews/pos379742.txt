location is great it is easy to walk to the marina and the shopping mall and restaurants there i went running every morning around the marina and down to the beach and all along the coast the staff at check in and check out were amazingly kind and helpful even though the hotel was pretty full and lines were long for both the buffet breakfast was also amazing with a wide variety of pastries cereals fruit and hot foods the views from the roof over the city are also spectacular especially at sunset
