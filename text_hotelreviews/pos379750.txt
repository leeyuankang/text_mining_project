the room was large especially as we had three adults from the same family sharing the room it was nice to have a separate bathroom shower room and dressing area it gave us all some privacy the air con in the room was very effective and was easy to adjust it was also relatively quiet so did not disturb our sleep it was a great central location and we could walk to most places from the hotel the hop on hop off bus stopped right outside we had no problem finding somewhere to eat within walking distance however if you don t can t walk there was always a taxi outside and the regular buses stopped outside as well
