very nice rooms big and clean the bathroom was having bidet which is very important point to me especially in europe where there is no water supply with the wc usually the staff were amazing very helpful and supportive the hotel location is great close to la rambla street and to the most of attractions in barcelona the sightseeing bus station is right front the hotel min walking to the metro station i enjoyed my stay at this hotel
