service was brilliant view from the room was amazing originally were given a room with disabled facilities which clearly hadn t been used for a while first it was difficult to use due to the height and two it was dusty however as soon as we said there was a problem we were treated extremely well very polite staff and nothing was too much trouble were upgraded and the room was extremely clean even better view than before
