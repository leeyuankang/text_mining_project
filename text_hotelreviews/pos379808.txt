the hotel was everything we could have wanted for our short trip upon arrival we was offered a glass of fizz and informed that we had been upgraded to a suite which was amazing the staff were friendly and helpful and we felt very looked after throughout our stay i cannot fault the staff in any way and the hotel itself is lovely the location is great and we found we was in the best position to go out and explore although we didn t eat in the restaurant we ordered room service for breakfast one morning and it was really nice also after a long day of sight seeing a member of staff brought some snacks to the room without us requesting it which was free of charge and very well received all in all a brilliant stay
