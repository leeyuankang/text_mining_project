we were upgraded to a suite because the hotel was very quiet time of year the staff were very pleasant and extra helpful with our luggage as we were joining a cruise ship i tend to remember hotels by their bathrooms and the bathroom was lovely a nice wallowie bath and a really good shower all impeccably clean i have no hesitation recommending this hotel and it staff
