this hotel was perfect and beyond my expectations booked the room for our last night in spain to ease our travel to the bcn early the next morning the harbor location provided easy walking access to the barri gotic and las ramblas the service was exceptional and took care of our arrangements for the way too early departure the next day the room was drop dead gorgeous and comfortable beyond belief just what we needed after some demanding travels the pillows were exceptional and you could even contact room service if you preferred a different type never seen that before what put this hotel over the top for us were the service and the view looking in to barcelona from the harbor watching the boats and the light change as the sun set wow must go to the uber cool lounge and have the signature cocktail and the unique tapas
