we booked this to stay at after a cruise but as our flights were very early on arrival we went and had lunch here before the cruise staff helpful location was perfect as the cruise shuttle bus was nearby room was amazing as we got an upgrade to a suite comfortable bed huge room also in a good location for las ramblas the harbour and cruise terminals
