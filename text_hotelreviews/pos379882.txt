our room was spacious the bed very large and comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space and shelving for the time we were there the staff were all very efficient and friendly the tour buses stopped a few minutes from the hotel and taxis were readily available to walk to the rambles area took us about minutes so everything is very accessible we also liked that we could walk around the corner for breakfast of coffee and pastry at very little cost so didn t need to pay hotel prices for this
