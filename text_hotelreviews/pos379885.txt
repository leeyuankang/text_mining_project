i had to travel alone as my husband couldn t go i was so glad i chose the grand marina initially for location but i wasn t disappointed i was even adopted by a lovely irish american family who took me to the cruise ship the next day the grand marina was a fantastic start to my adventure everything went very smoothly and very impressed by the ship sailing past my window
