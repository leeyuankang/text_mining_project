the tapas menu is terrible it s pretentious and tasteless and expensive the club sandwich was terrific the dinner choices are also pretentious and a bit of a mystery facial tissues in bathroom daily allotment facial tissues pre packaged for the cost of the room this is ridiculous staff was helpful and attentive they could use some more staff to take care of luggage for guests the entrance reception area outside the front of the hotel was the best those guys know what they are doing and do it well the food could be greatly improved and it would be nice to go to breakfast and be able to order a continental breakfast rather than pay a huge buffet fee for of the food you re not going to eat why can t anyone get a cup of coffee in a paper cup to take to the room that s a rip off if you only want a continental breakfast the room showers are the best we had a key door opening problem which was finally fixed after the staff changed the door handle
