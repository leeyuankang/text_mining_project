the room was fantastic with a separate hall way and the bath and shower rooms were also separate we also had a nice balcony with a view of the hotel restaurant and a a partial sea view the pool area though smaller than expected was lovely and clean lots of sunbeds and a great view of the port the restaurant was good value for breakfast with lots of options our son loved the daily free sweets in reception we booked the hotel as we were going on a disney cruise from the adjacent port and its location is absolutely fab very close to the ramblas and marina lots of bars restaurants etc
