my family and i didn t even want to leave because we had a wonderful time in barcelona and this hotel the location was really great on the second day we got upgraded for free because the people who stayed next to my parents room were pretty loud so we spent the rest of our trip in two lovely rooms with a breathtaking view the breakfast was also marvelous and the staff was so so so nice
