the rooms were a decent size it was a bit out of the way if you want to get to the beaches but within walking distance of la rambla and the hop on hop off bus routes the lounging area on top of the hotel was huge with plenty of lounge seating for about guests plus a bar with additional seating the downstairs staff was really great and helpful in all matters when it came to printing things off restaurant recommendations and things to do around the city
