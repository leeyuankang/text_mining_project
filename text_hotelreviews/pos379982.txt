huge bed extra comfy staff very attentive and the whole place spotless we chose harbour view and it was fascinating to watch the cruise ships but they are very close and can be noisy early on as they arrive in the night that didn t detract from the experience though location is a flat min walk to ramblas but there are constant taxi outside olympic port shopping and marina and beach also walkable barcelonetta beach approx walk but it s all sea front m very lovely stay would highly recommend
