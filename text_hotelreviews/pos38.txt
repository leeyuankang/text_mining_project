the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam i would definitely like to stay here again i only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as a brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts i was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and i personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good i will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to amsterdam
