staff members were fabulous welcoming friendly and helpful the hotel s location is excellent for either relaxing or sightseeing and balcony rooms have a wonderful view of the city and marina taxis are always plentiful and metro access is a fairly short walk away our room was extremely well appointed well serviced and the unusual touch of initially presenting toiletries in a gift bag was interesting a generous breakfast offered plenty of choice and there was even a small candy buffet operating all day we would definitely return
