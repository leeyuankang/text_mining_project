very helpful staff they were happy to speak to our car hire company about an issue we had good location it is minute walk to la rambla the main tourist strip but we enjoyed that other attractions are a bit of a walk which we don t mind or you can use the underground about minutes away great terrace on the top level which gives you a wonderful view of barcelona parking on site is a real advantage
