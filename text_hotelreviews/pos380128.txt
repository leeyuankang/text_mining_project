i booked the classic room and when i arrived i was upgraded to a suite with private terrace for one night and for the next night i was also upgraded to another suite very spacious fully equipped and luxurious suitable for couple or family with children i couldn t use it all since i m travelling solo the hotel has a small gym h with showers swimming pool restaurants and it is located at the marina only mins walk to the famous rambla street the staff members were beyond friendly when i checked out at noon i had to pray so they offered me the restaurant area to do my prayer they were suspicious at first for security reasons but it s understandable i would recommend this hotel for longer stays specially the value of money
