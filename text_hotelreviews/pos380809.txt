initially assigned room was horrible although reservation was made about months in advance we had to argue with hotel staff to get our rooms changed rooms air conditioner did not work and ceilings were slanted and was for better spacing it was unfortunate that hotel staff initially refused to do anything and we had to insist and had to threat the staff thst we would give a poor rating on internet only after that the staff agreed to change our rooms
