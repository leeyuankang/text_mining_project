this hotel is a gem beautiful and huge rooms with a stunning balcony there were no parking spots left in the hotel garage but they gave me a coupon to park at a garage just block away where the management was lovely and accommodating the hotel is an easy drive from the highway and only minutes to the airport when i went to collect the car at a m the next morning it was waiting for me since i had only the afternoon to explore barcelona i took both routes of the hop on hop off bus with a stop right across the street from the hotel for the orange line i would gladly book this hotel again
