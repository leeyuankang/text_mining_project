the room sizes great felt like an apartment great big beds and very comfortable choice of pillows plus extra bedding nice bars cafes restaurants on doorstep lovely area of barcelona the rooms clean enough we found the public areas needed more attention to its cleaning staff friendly professional manner although in the dining area not enough staff to be able to forfil their duties thoroughly the price of hotel is cheaper than others i would return without having breakfast plenty of little cafes to grab some from also knowing i m only getting a room with nothing else
