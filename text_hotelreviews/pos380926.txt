the bed was amazing and the room quiet so had a good sleep at night the shower was over a narrow bath so it was a bit tricky breakfast was good but cooked food greasy and dry coffee good fridge staff very friendly and efficient no one tells you about free tea coffee juice croissant in lounge in afternoon also wifi only allows devices at a time unless you ask for another voucher which is free
