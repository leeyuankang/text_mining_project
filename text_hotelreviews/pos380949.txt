this hotel s location is right on point the area is in a walking distance from la ramblas but it s also a peaceful block filled with cute restaurants and caf s we were sent to another hotel for the first night but upgraded to a suite for the rest of our stay that was great breakfast was good and the lady working at the breakfast room was the sweetest she even remembered my wish for a hot milk every morning
