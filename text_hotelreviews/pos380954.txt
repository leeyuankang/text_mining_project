the rooms were spacious clean and well looked after it was a good idea to have the door separating the bedroom from the living room the hotel location was great only a short walk from las ramblas or only euros in a taxi the hotel was only a minute bus journey from the camp nou stadium close to the metro station and bus links staff were extremely friendly and really helpful when asking for directions to places
