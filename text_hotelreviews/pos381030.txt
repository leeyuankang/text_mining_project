this review revolves mainly around an event that took place in one of the days when i was having breakfast at hotel rekord in barcelona to be short and concise there was just one nutella jar available at breakfast which means that basically people who wanted any had to pass it from one another not very convenient and the management might want to consider an alternative such as smaller nutella packs in any case when i wanted nutella there was no more so i asked the lady waiter i believe her name was lupe for some initially she told me that she can t help and that there will be more tomorrow but i politely insisted and she got me a new jar i was so satisfied i literally think she asked one of her colleagues to go out and buy another one she even taught me some words in spanish the next days i also wanted to pay for my hotel in advance and there was no issue obtaining the proforma invoice to wire them the money even though i was supposed to pay upon my arrival
