i arrived late from the airport the friendly guy at the reception explained me the functioning of the hotel while he was doing the check in i was put on the floor in a surprisingly nice room the room was wide with an entry having the desk the bathroom was really big there was a bath and a separate shower from the bed you have the tv right in front of you with all channels you can imagine this is a very good value for money hotel most like the other hotels in the same chain i always do my best to stay in catalonia hotels when in barcelona they never disappoint
