there was a mix up between booking com and the hotel the rate through booking was a lot lower than the hotel s system we simply showed the email to the staff and they didn t hesitate in complying with booking com s rate i know that s the right thing to do but i ve been in that situation before and the staff is usually not helpful but the complete opposite staff at catalonia barcelona were exceedingly polite
