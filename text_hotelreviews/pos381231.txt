nice hotel and stylish room i would have expected water available and three nights in june was almost so breakfast thrown in would have been nice super comfy and good sized bed and room was spacious staff were good and welcoming close to the station which was super handy and even though close to the road the room was quiet but i am being picky here very good hotel
