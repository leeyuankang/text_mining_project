the location was decent but certainly not city centre in the sense that it s close to a train station and a convenience store it costs about per person to get to the train station from the airport so if there is alot of you you re better off getting a taxi works out cheaper if you take the train you can literally see the hotel when you exit the train station to get to central amsterdam you need the tram change to tram or at admiral or williem stops when you have done this once it s pretty straightforward you just do the reverse when you want to get back i d also recommend not buying the day ticket coz one walks alot and only needs a single ticket to get into amsterdam and another single to get back works out cheaper the rooms were clean and all things you need for a comfortable stay were provided except full range of toiletries i e moisturiser they darken up well at night if you re ok with the cons it s a relatively decent stay with no cause for issues
