we arrived and instantly worried how much we had spent because it looked sooo nice and posh no need to panic just good value lovely staff both on desk and porters who offered advise on enjoying our stay we got a free upgrade to a privilege room the bed and walk in shower wet room was huge and amazing and luxurious best nights sleep in months no noise at all and a nespresso machine to wake us up both mornings very modern decor with warm relaxed feel and lovely art everywhere location wise we were right next to the train station which connected us straight to the airport and we were a cycle ride to the city center and only from parks and climbing centres
