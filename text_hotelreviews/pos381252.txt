the location is very convenient the sloterdijk train station is within a short walking distance it takes only minutes by train to reach the city center the hotel is modern the room is rather small but it is cozy and comfortable it was also very quiet the reception desk personnel is friendly attentive and accommodating i would definitely stay at this hotel again
