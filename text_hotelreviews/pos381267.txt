the hotel was of a very good quality the rooms looked lovely a tad small but high standard finish cleanliness of the room was great and the shower was lovely the upstairs restaurant was brilliant we arrived late and they did their best to accommodate us the hotel is in a really good location minute walk maybe less to the station it was a minute journey to central and minute to schiphol
