the hotel itself is wonderful and modern it s very clean as the maids come round and do the rooms and hotel everyday the staff are fantastic and the rooms are perfect we had a lovely double bed which was super comfy but the bathroom area is amazing especially the shower i m just back from a night stay and i couldn t have asked for anything more the fact the train station is seconds from the hotel and dam square is minutes away on the train is just a bonus so i couldn t fault the location of the hotel in any way shape or form for me it was super i absolutely loved my stay and i can t wait to get back to amsterdam and of course the mercure hotel as i won t be staying anywhere else
