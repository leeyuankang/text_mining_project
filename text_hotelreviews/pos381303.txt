we really liked the location of the hotel it is one train away from the amsterdam central which is perfect for those who would like to rest well after a long day our room was at the floor if i could remember it well it was very quiet aside from our last night in the hotel maybe that was past in the morning and i heard someone moaning quite loudly lol didnt last long so that should be fine i think haha then the staffs were polite and helpful the room was big enough for two persons i really love the rain shower in the bathroom and the room was clean during our stay
