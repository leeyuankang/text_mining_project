although the property is not located in the city centre access to the city is quick and easy by train the hotel is located within walking distance from the station one can see the station from the hotel so even with luggage this should not be a problem the hotel room was large and comfortable with a kettle and coffee tea a desk and chair made it possible to do some work or share some holiday pictures one facebook the staff were very friendly and assisted me where possible
