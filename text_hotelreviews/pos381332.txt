big roomy corner floor room with a view while not a scenic view as such it was a lovely urban night view with windows on two walls huge bathroom very comfortable bed pillows great monsoon shower hot good pressure kettle and mini fridge in room tea coffee provided location only into the bustle of amsterdam centraal other direction to schiphol possible to leave luggage there for a while after checking out staff are friendly courteous and nothing is too much trouble all done with a smile accommodated me with early check in storing case on leaving i have stayed in city centre on previous occasions it s fine once or twice to try it out but invariably expensive and cramped and those vertiginous staircases are not for the faint hearted mercure is clean modern spacious calm and excellent value it s well worth one hop on the train i would not hesitate to return here
