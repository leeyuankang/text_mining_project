excellent location only mins from central station one stop on the train mins on a bus all readily accessible from the hotel within a couple of minutes walk no tram but there is a metro which takes a little longer cycling could be an option and the hotel has bikes you can hire breakfast was very good with a fairly good selection of continental and cooked options room was clean spacious and had everything i needed including a safe and iron would stay again
