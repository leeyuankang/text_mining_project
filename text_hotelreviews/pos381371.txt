hotel was very modern clean and the staff were so lovely and helpful wifi was excellent and the rooms were very nice exactly like the pictures the air con was very useful as the weather was very stuffy at night when trying to sleep so we were kept nice and cool location was handy as we were only a few minutes train ride from the city centre
