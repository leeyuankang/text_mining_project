hotel was very close to railway station was easy walk with luggage station to central station and easy access to other transport from there we bought a days transport pass which allowed freedom to travel on any public transport any time over the days reception staff were very helpful with directions rooms were very clean and comfortable we were in amsterdam to commence our river cruise to budapest and were able to walk directly from the central station to the cruise wharf was good value for money
