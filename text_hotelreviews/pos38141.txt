the staff were absolutely brilliant they did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible we had a problem with our tap and they let us take as much water from the mini bar as we liked free of charge they even brought more up without being asked the design and decor of the hotel is beautiful it s very charming the check out time was appreciated
