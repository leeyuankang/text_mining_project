boutique hotel rooms in the style of a georgian gentleman s residence on a lovely old street off the very modern bishopsgate equidistant from shoreditch and the city and an easy walk in both directions there is a decent pub with nice terrace opposite mins from liverpool st the three reception rooms are charmingly and elegantly furnished with antiques and the whole hotel has a quirky feel rather than stuffy and old fashioned our room despite not being contemporary had all modern requirements including plenty of sockets and good wifi the antique bed was supremely comfortable with luxurious bedlinen the room and bathroom were charmingly furnished the bathroom with its copper shower bath and ren toiletries was a treat to spend time in staff were friendly helpful and efficient we enjoyed a breakfast in bed of delicious bacon sandwiches one morning highly recommended considering that a few weeks ago i paid for a night in the victoria premier inn we feel that batty langley s is excellent value
