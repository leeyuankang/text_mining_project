the bed was absolutely beautiful best night sleep in a long while the location also is not bad at all if you don t mind a minute walk although sloterdijk train station is minutes away as well as team stations dotted around the area the staff where brilliant and the room was beautiful we paid extra to have the privilege room and was worth it
