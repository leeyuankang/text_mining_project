the beds were very comfortable although a little high and i wasn t told i could have a step to help me the bathroom and shower were excellent the decorations were tasteful and the many antiques were interesting there was also a comprehensive history of the historical area that the hotel is situated in a thoughtful touch breakfast brought to the room as standard was a bonus an honesty bar for drinks an unusual and unexpected touch respecting the guests trustworthyness and the staff without exception were helpful in the extreme i would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to be pampered and comfortable i give the hotel stars or more if possible
