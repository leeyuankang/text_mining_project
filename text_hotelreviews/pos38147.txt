bed was amazing room was really immaculately appointed with a small comfortable sitting room area apple tv system worked a treat there was a speaker in the bathroom so we could listen to music in there too the bathroom itself was a spotless work of victorian art the terrace provided an awesome london rooftop view and a great place for drinks breakfast although you d struggle to get more than people out there extremely friendly welcoming staff and a really nice atmosphere a great base from which to explore spitalfields and shoreditch and only a couple minutes walk from liverpool street station underground with it s new bars and restaurants black cabs also in abundance nearby because of the station i would absolutely stay again without hesitation
