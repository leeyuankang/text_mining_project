the hotel is very close to transports tram train bus gets you to the city in minutes or outside of town via sprinters train transports are not expensive especially if you use the iamsterdam card the room was very clean and tidy nice and warm facilities little to no noise from the outside beautiful bathroom with all facilities roomy and nice bed for a young couple the stodyjk station nearby has some stores a supermarket and some take away food stores to help in times of need the meals and view from the restaurant topside are very nice a short yet very well prepared and cooked list of dishes is available we ve not enjoyed but it has also a bar that allows to have a nice cocktail while resembling amsterdam city
