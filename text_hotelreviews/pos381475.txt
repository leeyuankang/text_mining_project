super sexy and classy interior design it gave a feeling of total luxury the bed was supremely comfortable and i slept very deeply i also enjoyed the bathroom the rainshower and the soft lighting staff was friendly and helpful the lounge is cosy and warm the location isn t that great if you want to explore amsterdam but we went to an event minutes walk away from mercure so for us the location was perfect warmly recommended
