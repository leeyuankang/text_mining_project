ren toiletries are a lovely touch and the use of antiques from bathroom items to wardrobes adds to the charm i used this hotel for an overnight post concert treat ive been lucky to stay at some of the best hotels in the world and this is a firm favourite its quirky special secret luxurious wonderfully finished a thanks to the staff as well we had breakfast in bed and that was of a high quality as well my only criticism is on the tea tray there was no coffee yes i know i said tea tray but thought coffee might be there however i know with certainty that if i had rung and asked for coffee it would have arrived so i refuse to deduct even points rating
