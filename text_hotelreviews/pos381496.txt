clean hotel and excellent bathroom however the closest is setting in front of the door that we almost bump into the closest before we find the switch of the light the enterience is a bit tight for setting between bathroom and closest we carried two two large luggage and its a bit difficult to pull them into the room aside from that the location is great if you re looking for a business stay
