i had booked a deluxe room but on arrival we had been upgraded to a junior suite which was a really kind gesture the staff were as helpful friendly and polite as any hotel i have ever stayed in across the world the hotel was so quiet which makes a change from normal hustle and bustle of london hotels i loved the d cor all the original artwork sculptures were out of this world felt like i was back in the early s the bathroom was amazing with a massive walk in shower free standing bath and toilet which was a thrown never have i enjoyed sitting on a toilet as much honestly the hotel is a little out of my price range but it was a special occasion and i would stay here again for something special
