this charming boutique hotel gives you a sense of being at home the welcome and efficiency of the staff were second to none the room was cosy and the bed ensured an excellent night sleep with air conditioning which cooled the room on a hot balmy night i had breakfast which was served to me outside in the courtyard highly recommend the creamy porridge i will definitely return thank you
