breakfast and lunch was great great location only a quick bus ride into the city centre and to the airport both of which are free with iamsterdam card station sloterdijk is viewable from hotel but thankfully noise from trains etc was not an issue lovely rooms and helpful staff allowed us to store our luggage for free on the last day as we had an evening flight would recommend
