the bedroom was amazing incredibly comfortable bed brilliant facilities comfy bath robes loads of towels very clean huge stocked and reasonably priced mini bar and the most amazing bit was the bathroom i spent about hours in the super hot extra large bath truly the most comfortable room i have stayed in for years i would also add that the staff were also spot on you are greeted and shown to your room by hour service brilliant the rest of the hotel was also finished to the same high standard with a very comfortable lounge that has an honour bar and is well stocked and well maintained with ice and anything you might need there is a library and the whole place just has an amazing feel to it breakfast is all room service and has a great selection that again is reasonably priced the rooms have apple tv which is enabled to play content from your phone tablet netflix etc which is a nice touch and it works overall i think that this is the best stay i have had in the last years
