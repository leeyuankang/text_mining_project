i liked the location of the hotel very near to amsterdam sloterdijk train station where u can reach amsterdam central station one stop only and from there u can go everywhere also its min by train from the airport and min by taxi i liked too the decor of the hotel generally especially the room rooms are very comfortable the staff was very friendly and always smiling
