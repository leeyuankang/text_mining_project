arriving at the hotel hours before checkin we were pleasantly surprised to find our room ready for us the concierge gave us a tour of the wonderful common areas on the ground floor and explained the facilities of the hotel our room was beautifully designed and impeccably clean overall batty langley s is well worth the premium compared to other hotels in this part of central london and offers a rare example of a very english kind of luxury we also took the opportunity since we were right next door to visit dennis severs house highly recommended if you have a spare minutes and an interest in the history of london
