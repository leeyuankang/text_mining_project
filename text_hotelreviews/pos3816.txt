the hotel is amazingly designed the walls and curtains are fluffy what more could you want the staff were all really helpful and friendly we woke up without hot water and they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room however they noticed the hot water issue was covering the full hotel which unfortunately they couldn t get fixed immediately on a saturday they offered all customers of their booking back which was great
