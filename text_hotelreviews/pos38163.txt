the rooms are really well sound proofed we didn t hear any other guests even though they were busy the furnishings and room sizes are excellent the en suites are very big too and we had a separate large shower and rolltop bath the bed pillows and duvet were all perfect and in spite of my husband s snoring i had an excellent nights sleep it was our wedding night so the hotel gave us a complimentary small bottle of champagne which was a nice touch we didn t order breakfast or coffee in the morning but we did utilise the honesty bar the extras are reasonably priced for london and the standard of the hotel batty langley s is my go to place now if i ever need want to stay in town
