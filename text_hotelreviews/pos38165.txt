the hotel is sumptuous gorgeous and elegant its not the kind of hotel where you ll find groups of debauched drunken people paying to stay at or hang out in so in terms of location party central shoreditch it s quite a rare find in that part of town if you weren t looking you d walk past and never know it was there it is truly a hidden gem and a very grown up and exclusive place to stay i stayed in the box room alone which is the maximum number of people you could get in there its small but perfectly formed a small double bed separate shower wc and beautifully tiled throughout
