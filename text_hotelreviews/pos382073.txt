the croissants were indeed very flaky the breakfast was excellent with a great variety and lots of choice we didn t dine in the restaurant but the menu looked quite good the location took a little getting used to but the ferry to and from amsterdam centre was a pleasure to use we would certainly use this hotel again when i n amsterdam
