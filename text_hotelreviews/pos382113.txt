the staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the moment we were greeted with a warm chocolate cookie they couldn t do enough for us the room was very smart and cosy the shower was amazing the bed was comfy the television also had a good range of channels including english channels but subtitles were available for others the use of windows instead of walls made the room feel slightly bigger and provided a few different views for us every day staff cleaned the room and provided fresh water bottles and towels the hotel was extremely close to the ferry stop which was very handy for visiting amsterdam central and close by to a lovely cafe
