amazing bed stylish rooms and hotel location is not in city centre centrum and is actually acoss the river from the main shopping tourist and other attractions a free ferry across is just minutes walk from the hotel and the ferry is about minutes so centrum is easily accessible the ferry runs all night so location was not really a problem and also being in an area with no other buildings meant you can get a very very quiet night s sleep
