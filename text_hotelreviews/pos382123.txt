the hotel was clean and modern with great views from floor to ceiling free ferry crossing was a bonus local markets nearby selling hot chocolate and mulled wine hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating to our group in particular to cater for about allergy fresh warm cookies baked fresh on site were given in the morning and evenings would definitely return to this hotel
