the location is great you catch a free ferry over to the city centre which only takes also very easy to get to and from the airport by train which only cost for two people each way the hotel from the outside isn t the best looking but inside definitely makes up for it the room was luxurious with a comfort bed a lovely view cosy dressing gowns spacious walk in shower large flat screen tv coffee tea making facilities and electronic system to request clean up service or do not disturb also one to control lights the staff were very helpful and polite the cookies we got given was a nice touch the hotel is worth the money the stay was excellent would definitely recommend
