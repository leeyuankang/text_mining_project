loved the ferry ride into the city each morning lovely view across the water seeing all the different boats and ferries staff were very efficient friendly and helpful in the hotel i couldn t believe when i got on the ferry the first time and part way across there was an old submarine just parked in the water a few locals had clear been out and decorated it definitely something different
