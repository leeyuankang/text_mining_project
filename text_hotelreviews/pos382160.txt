loved everything from the moment we walked in the location is out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre but only a short ferry ride away our room had an amazing view of the wharf bedroom was tidy and bed was super comfy the staff are only more than willing to help with any enquiry absolutely loved our stay here and will definitely be back again
