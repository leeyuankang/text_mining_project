we stayed at batty langley on our wedding night and it was such an amazing experience an absolute gem of a place right in the heart of london we were upgraded on arrival to the suite and offered free champagne as a welcome it was such a lovely touch by the staff and really appreciated the hotel is like stepping back in time and a world away from outside which makes for the perfect tonic to city life for recharging the batteries and jumping back into the mix we would like to say a big thank you to the staff for being so considerate and kind and for making our wedding day even more special we would love to go back and if you are looking for a place to stay that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed without the gimmick that other high end hotels in the city provide look no further
