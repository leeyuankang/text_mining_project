the location was perfect close enough to amsterdam centre without the noise and the crowds there is a free ferry which takes you back and forward all day long the journey took only mins and it is right outside the train station the hotel was fantastic we got a great deal through booking com the staff were really nice friendly etc couldn t ask for better will stay here again and have already recommended it to family and friends there is a large eaterie called pllek which we visited on the last day it is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel which was well worth a visit the burger here was delicious so was the wild boar sausage
