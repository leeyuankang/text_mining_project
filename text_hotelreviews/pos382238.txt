this hotel is great located in an interesting area of up and coming district of former ship yard you have to take a free ferry to the central station but it only takes minutes and actually is an atraction itself the room was really nice with great view of the city the staff at the reception was great very helpful especially melissa went out of her way to make us feel at home at the best part they keep warm chocolate cookies at the reception and you can help yourself whenever you want
