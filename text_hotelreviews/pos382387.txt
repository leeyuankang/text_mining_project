the atmoshpere of the hotel is really great young trendy dynamic decorated with style staff was very kind i have travelled with my years old god daughter and we had lots of fun the hotel is in absolute downtown but in a small street so we had no probelm at all with the noise of the city bars around ther kitchen is fabulous we were planning to explore several restaurants but finally choose to come back for meals almost all the time
