the hotel v nesplain is a lovely boutique hotel with quirky style the staff were helpful and very pleasant our room was huge on the top floor at the end of the corridor the bed was magical i d love to know what it is my only negative comment is about the housekeeping schedule my daughter and i left every day in the morning and came back to our room around and our room hadn t been serviced after mentioning this to the staff they had our room ready the next afternoon they also comped us some champagne while we waited for our room to be cleaned i will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in amsterdam the location was perfect it s tucked in a side street in the center of town dank u wel tot ziens
