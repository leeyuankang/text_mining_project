the hotel has a hip vibe and is in a quiet backstreet yet central to everything location is great it s a bit overpriced for the size of the room and functionality has been overlooked by funky in the case of the chairs in the room the restaurant is also hip and all the staff very friendly and speak good english wifi fantastic
