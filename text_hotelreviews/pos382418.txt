we had an exceptionally late early morning check in and the staff on duty was so friendly and welcoming despite the time the rooms were perfect for us with coffee tea making facilities and a mini bar the breakfast room was warm and welcoming with a many traditional and standard items on the menu to choose from even though on paper the hotel appears to be on the border of the red light district the hotel environs are quite the hotel is situated about a from the central station so public transport is very accessible
