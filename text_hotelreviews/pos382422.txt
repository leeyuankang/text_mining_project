the location of the hotel was fantastic the rooms in the hotel come with different configurations comparing the two rooms we had booked ours was a bit smaller than out friends but our bathroom was much more spacious with a tub and a shower their room was a bit larger with a smaller bathroom so be smart as ask for specific rooms and they dont all look like the photos on their site still very comfortable and clean and friendly staff
