central location within walking distance of all main attractions hotel has a really relaxed atmosphere but offers everything you could ask for staff were helpful and attentive rooms were cleaned daily beds very comfortable and although its in the citys heart it was always quiet we didnt eat an evening meal there but the breakfasts were amazing and nothing was too much trouble highly recommended and will definitely return
