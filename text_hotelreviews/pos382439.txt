could not fault this hotel will definitely stay here again when i return to amsterdam was visiting with my boyfriend for a birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay special room was so chic and stylish extremely clean shower was lovely wish mine at home was like that haha extra large beds were hard to get out of a morning also loved the chandelier
