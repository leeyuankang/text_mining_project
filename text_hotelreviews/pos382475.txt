this hotel is just steps from dam square and within walking distance of virtually everything a tourist would want to experience we found the hotel staff exceptionally friendly cheerful and helpful the room was clean the washroom spacious and the beds very comfortable the lobby restaurant was totally full with locals every night but the hotel managed to provide us a table despite the fact that they were already fully booked the food for dinner was exceptional and the breakfast choices delicious and varied
