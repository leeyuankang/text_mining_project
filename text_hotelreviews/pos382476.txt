the location is simply superb stuff is young and very careful the lobby restaurant yes it is in the hotel s lobby is very good and in high demand you better make reservation for a dinner room was nice and modern you do not have to buy the breakfast upfront it is in the lobby it is possible to pick what you want every morning highly recommended
