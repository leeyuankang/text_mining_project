i have stayed in this hotel before and went back because it is so nice a very short walk to dam square yet in a quiet street the hotel has very friendly staff and the restaurant is excellent with the bonus of a very nice outdoor terrace we had a very nice suite which was huge by amsterdam standards very comfortable excellent service highly recommanded
