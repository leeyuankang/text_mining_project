the hotel is ideally placed in the centre of the city close to all the main tourist sites all the staff spoke perfect english and were incredibly helpful the hotel is quite funky and a draw for younger people but we did not feel out of place as a mature couple the lobby restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel in the city centre
