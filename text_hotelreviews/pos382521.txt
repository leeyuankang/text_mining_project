i travelled here with my husband for a weekend trip and we were blown away the style and decor of the room and hotel was contemporary and comfortable the location was perfect in the heart of dam square yet tucked away for a quiet nights sleep we didn t have breakfast at the hotel but enjoyed a delicious meal one evening where the service was flawless and the food incredibly good value having been to amsterdam a few times before i wouldn t stay any where else from now on
