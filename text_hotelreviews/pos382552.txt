the purpose of the stay was a birthday a staff member at the hotel personally got in touch with me to arrange a gift from the hotel to be in the room on arrival this was far beyond the level of service i expected and greatly appreciated it began the stay in the beautiful and comfortable hotel rather nicely impressed second and third most by the location to central amsterdam and generous room sizes will be booking again in future
