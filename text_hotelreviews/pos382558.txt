the online reviews i read about this hotel we re nothing in comparison to what it was any reviews saying the rooms we re small the staff weren t attentive etc was not experienced by myself what so ever we booked a standard room and were given a key card for a room on the second floor the room had wonderfully quirky decor was spacious and spotlessly clean the staff replaced water coffee tea shampoos and soaps every morning for the room and the service at the front desk and in the restaurant was also attentive and friendly the food by the way was also amazing i recommended other friends to book for a meal even though they weren t staying with us all in all along with the perfect location this hotel was the best i ve stayed in amsterdam this was my trip i will be booking to stay there on my next visit and would recommend anyone to book and if you can t get in make sure you go for a meal at least
