took my partner for a surprise night away we fell in love with this charming hotel it felt more like we were staying in someone s house than in a hotel we really enjoyed exploring all the little common areas with their open fire old books nice touch was the honesty bar the luxury of having breakfast in our room although breakfast is extra wrapped in the fluffy robes provided gorgeous furniture fixings stunning bathroom would love to stay there again next time we want to treat ourselves ideal location near spitalfields market
