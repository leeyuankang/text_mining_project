beautiful boutique house hotel with excellent service and great location close to liverpool street a quiet oasis but close to the city and hustle and bustle of smithfields market room service was superb and a very comfortable stay overall we just struggled to get the temperature right in the room either too warm or too cold will stay again highly recommend
