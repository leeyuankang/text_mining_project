i stayed for one night at the beautiful batty langley s it was the best hotel i could choose the staff was fantastic very helpful and gave me an amazing restaurant recommendation the room was big enough for myself or for a couple that i had to ring the door bell to be able to enter the hotel gave me a very safe feeling the breakfast to the bed the next morning was the perfect ending of my short trip to london i will come back for sure
