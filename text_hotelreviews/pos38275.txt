everyone that we met at the hotel were very friendly when me and my bf arrived they already knew to expect us and who we were the location was amazing breakfast was generous and was served in the room it was raining the weekend we stayed and we did not have an umbrella with us and they had an umrella prepared for each guest so we used it whenever we wanted to go around the area the room and the whole hotel was very cozy and full of character definitely going to stay here again
