amazing breakfast great location next to westbanhof station where you can find many services tickets can be purchased from the station it is recommended that you purchase a ticket for week day which includes all services underground tram buses and probably city trains very friendly personnel interesting decoration make sure you visit this hotel with someone you feel comfortable looking at you while having a shower or make sure you request a room which has a curtain in front
