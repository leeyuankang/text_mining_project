this hotel was a pleasant surprise even after checking out all previous feedback the room was nicely appointed with a shower that was situated in the middle of the room which was fun there were also different lighting choices for the room which again was fun the hotel itself was very very tasteful with classy decor in both the room and common spaces especially for the price i didn t realize that breakfast was included when i booked but was very happy it was because that was the best hotel breakfast we ve had in ages with lots of friendly waitstaff on hand to ensure a great start to the morning all in all we d stay here again
