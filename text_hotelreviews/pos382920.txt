i was searching for a hotel with adequate offer including booking discount with a sauna and a good breakfast good location close to metro westbahnhof if you do not want to travel from the airport by several subway lines that is a direct bus approx about hours whatever you choose bus or train metro although it is necessary to take the evening rush hour into account since bus goes round the cityhall in the center and stops frequently the staff at the reception is friendly breakfast is acceptable but room size is specified with a shower square so suitable for a single person two are already to be a bit crowded because of angles interesting solution with a shower at the center of a room it wasn t good or bad for me but this hotel as many others in vienna offers apples in rooms and other places but sauna is in the hotel it s size is sufficient for persons but
