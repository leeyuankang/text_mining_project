the hotel is a relatively new one with modern stylish looks good location for public transport but not in an upmarket neighbourhood extremely welcoming reception departure was a bit detached though comfort room single use of queen bed room very pleasant and clean with adequate amenities although no in room coffee or tea making facilities an unusual open bathroom setting with a glass shower cabin i suspect only acceptible by partners or very good friends but i rather liked it private toilet though the shower is excellent good wifi too the second building is connected to the first one and much quieter by the lack of traffic noise there is an in house connection as if they were just one building so no crossing of an open court with smoking men as a few older reviews mentioned excellent breakfast i tried the restaurant once it served decent quality food in fact everything is good or excellent except for a few unfortunate sleeping issues
