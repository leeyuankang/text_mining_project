great location and the best breakfast i have had in a hotel i can also highly recommend having a night of dinner in the restaurant at night because they serve good and tasty dishes the location is great with one of the biggest shopping streets practically right around the corner the room was very clean pretty and comfortable they also have a pillow menu for when the current pillow isn t comfortable enough for you
