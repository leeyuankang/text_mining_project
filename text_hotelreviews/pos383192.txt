a great hotel with nice and friendly staff very clean the room has airco heater built in it is minutes walking from webstbannhoff metro train station which has a huge shopping mall with all the stuff you would need just upon arrival remember to tell the reception you would like to opt out from things hotel breakfast it costs euro and is absolutely unnecessary there is a subway sandwich in front of the hotel and a nice cheap super market billa at the corner of the street where you can buy anything you need for a full breakfast much much cheaper tell the reception you will not need breakfast from the hotel mini bar in the room mini bar in the room is a small fridge and the reception asks for a euro deposit in case you consume anything from mini bar during your stay but a bottle of water in the mini bar costs around euro it s pretty expensive and unnecessary tell the reception you will not consume anything from mini bar and keep it so buy your own drinks from the supermarket at the corner billa and keep them cold inside the mini bar you won t need to pay anything for using the mini bar
