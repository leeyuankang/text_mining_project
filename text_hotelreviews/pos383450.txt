the staff were so helpful and friendly when we asked for recommendations the location was great being so close to a metro station minute walk but in a quiet part of barcelona so you were able to retreat back to the hotel after experiencing the hustle and bustle of barcelona the room was very comfortable we had adults sharing and there was plenty of room for us
