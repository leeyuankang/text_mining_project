i liked the willingness of the staff to help in good english with any information that we asked about they were always more than accommodating regardless of who was at the front counter very good restaurant staff i liked the location because of the close proximity to two great grocery stores restaurants shopping and the main train metro bus station in barcelona sants estacio this hotel would receive my first consideration for a place to stay if i am ever lucky enough to return to the great friendly city of barcelona
