staff were lovely the room was clean and it had all necessary facilities including a secure room to store luggage after checking out there was also a large selection of foods at breakfast we didn t speak any spanish but the staff understood our english perfectly and were quite fluent in other languages too there was always someone on reception and they greeted us warmly every time we entered the reception area the location of the hotel isn t far from one of the aerob s drop off points making it easy to get to from the airport i d happily stay here again and i would recommend it to anyone thank you very much for a great stay
