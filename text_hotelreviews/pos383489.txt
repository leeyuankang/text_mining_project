front desk staff were really efficient and very pleasant with a sound command of english unlike my spanish the hotel is a short walk from barcelona santes rail station which in turn is a short hop by train from the airport the train station is connected to the airport s terminal by a long enclosed overhead walkway which is great if it s wet there is no travelator though for the older less fit or those with heavy baggage excellently positioned hotel if staging through barcelona or indeed staying as the nearest station on the first class city wide metro system is just round the corner
