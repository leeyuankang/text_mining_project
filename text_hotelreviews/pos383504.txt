having read the reviews i was slightly concerned that the room i had been booked would be too small to accommodate myself and my partner however i was pleasantly surprised the room was more than big enough with plenty of wardrobe space and a mini fridge the bathroom was spacious and well decorated and the hotel and room was kept immaculate by the staff very close to the metro about stops from the centre of barcelona and perfect location for a mini break with supermarkets minutes away
