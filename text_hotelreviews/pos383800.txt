the staff was exceptionally helpful with customer service on the decline and not the norm nowadays it is wonderful to see it in action and thriving in such a high touch way no matter what my request was i was always met with a can do attitude and a sincere willingness to help or find resolutions options the location exceeded expectations so central to everything almost all key spots and landmarks are within walking distance a dream spot liked the hotel location and service so much i extended my stay by a day
