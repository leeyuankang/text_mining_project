the hotel has been recently and expensively refurbished and the interior of the rooms ad the hotel is perfect and matched by the price to stay staff were very helpful and knowledgeable of amsterdam we booked two superior rooms with a view but apparently because we had asked for the rooms to be close to each other we were given one room with a view and another over the main street the room with a view overlooked the amstel river and was very good if a little on the small side only about room between foot of the bed and the wall the bathrooms in both rooms were excellent the housekeeping was a bit hit and miss we ended up new towels every day the restaurant is a new concept it s basically a vegetarian restaurant with meat as a side dish if you want it we tried it despite by avowed carnivore tendencies and i was surprisingly pleased bith with the food and the service which was exceptional the vegetarian shushi is a real surprise breakfast was excellent both range and quality of food nd of the service at breakfast as was the service throughout the hotel
