the location was amazing most of the staff were very accomodating and helped us with everything the room was a little small but that was completely negated by the fact that the windows opened over the canal looking out to rembrandt square the hotel building was a beautiful heritage building with a lot of history and the breakfast spread was lavish and delicious member of the party arrived early in the morning and they made room available to her and gave us free early check in which was great because she had just come off a hour flight
