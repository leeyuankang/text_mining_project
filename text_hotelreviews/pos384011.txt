i booked this hotel for a short break in amsterdam for nights arrival upon arrival we were told that were given a free upgrade to a room no with a nice view the guest relations people were nice and friendly and the hotel looked quite up market we had to pay upfront for the whole cost of the room and pay a deposit for the mini bar location the hotel is quite well located and near most of the attractions although its a little trek on foot from the train station room the room was of average size and to be honest i thought it would be a little larger it has one decent sized wardrobe with a safe tea and coffee facilities for free a shower a large hd tv which was nice a couple of bed side tables and a couple of chairs and a large mirror the view wasn t too bad but i m sure the canal side views were better and i certainly wouldn t have paid extra for the view we had see photo for room view breakfast the food was lovely and the service was good no complaints here there is a buffet or you can ask at the table and the water will bring it for you not sure of the waiters name but he was very good we didn t have dinner here so can t comment but i m sure it would be equally as good
