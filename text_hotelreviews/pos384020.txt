all the staff were very friendly and helpful and gave you individual attention beakfast was perfectly acceptable although quite expensive because of eggs etc cooked individually which itself was excellent one did have to allow additional time when on a tight business schedule also found a very good cafe opposite at which i received equally good attention i will certainly go back to that hotel if i am in amsterdam again
