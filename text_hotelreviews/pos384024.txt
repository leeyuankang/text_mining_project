lovely hotel in the centre of amsterdam location could not have been more ideal everything was clean fresh and staff were very helpful the hotel restaurant swych is exceptional it is not your typical hotel dinning room the food is some of the best we have ever eaten and the concept behind the menu is fresh and well developed there will be a star here soon would highly recommend having breakfast included fresh smoothies super juices cooked buffet and continental fine fine quality spread
