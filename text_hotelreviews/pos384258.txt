upon arrival we were upgraded to a larger room and it was wonderful huge with an an amazing bathroom our room was located in a small wing of the building so it felt very private we had an amazing view of the street and nightlife the location couldn t have been better super close to everything we just walked to central station the hotel was undergoing renovations downstairs but the staff ensured our accommodation was top notch the room was super comfortable and flawlessly clean the bathroom had a huge tub it was the size of a hotel room by itself
