very pleasant hotel with pleasant helpful and well informed staff room nice and quiet despite the king s birthday celebrations outside we didn t get disturbed by it at all and bed very comfy nice to have a safe in the room and one that was easy to program and didn t cost extra bar cosy with nice ambiance we didn t use the restaurant but that looked quite nice too
