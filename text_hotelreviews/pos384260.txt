the staff at this hotel were the best i ve come across during my extensive touring of europe the location of this hotel is fab just meters from dam square everything is on your doorstep to walk to or you can hop on one of the trams buses right at the hotel entrance if needed you can walk from the central train station just be mindful that many streets are cobbled which makes dragging a suitcase a bit tricky at times the hotel building dates back to the s is the birthplace of heineken so don t expect ultra modern as many of the original decor features have been kept a room at the front of the hotel with street view is worthwhile but be advised the street lighting shines into the room at night
