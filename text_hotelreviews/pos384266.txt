horrible experience one of those that you feel stolen the pictures on the booking com website are totally misleading hotel was extremely expensive around eur a night rooms are tiny and not new the door between the bed and bathroom would hinge badly every time we open closed the toiletries are suitable for a star hotel maximum would never recommend this hotel for the price i was charged horrible experience
