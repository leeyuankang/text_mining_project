the best part about this hotel was the location the location is a bit touristy but centrally located so that you can walk to most attractions the hotel was clean and had a historic vibe to the outside we ended up staying at this location because the price was very similar to a lower star hotel the size of the room was much larger than the other hotels in the area the staff were helpful with directions and using the public transportation there was a nice bar in the building that we didn t use they also appeared to be doing renovations on a restaurant at the location
