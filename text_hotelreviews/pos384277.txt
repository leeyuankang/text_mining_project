this hotel is so central the staff are so helpful they really go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable the beds are the comfiest beds i have ever slept in the bathrooms were spotless and the shower is very powerful they are currently renovating the restaurant i think and during our stay we never heard one loud noise we barley saw the workers which was great you would never know that is being renovated
