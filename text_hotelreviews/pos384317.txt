hotel was not full when we stayed there and we arrived to find we were upgraded to an executive room a great surprise since it was my wife s birthday and our wedding anniversary all of the staff from the manager to the domestics were outwardly friendly and helpful the standard of cleanliness exceeded that of a few star hotels i ve used in the uk i don t think we could have a picked a more conveniently located hotel for our first visit to amsterdam
