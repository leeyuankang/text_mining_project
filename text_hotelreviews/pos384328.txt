the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much bother for them they helped us with tickets for the museums and gave advice on trams etc food was of an excellent quality and well presented both at breakfast and evening meal the restaurant staff were also very good the hotel was in a central location which was particularly helpful for us as my husband cannot walk far at the moment it was very clean and welcoming we would return
