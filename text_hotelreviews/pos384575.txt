the hotel was unique new paper printer theme running through out from the wall paper to the restaurant to the employee s uniforms the employee s were super helpful and very pleasant to work with it was pretty much a flawless stay at a great place i marked them slightly off for price which was a bit high given everything i would stay there again and recommend it to friends with no hesitation at all
