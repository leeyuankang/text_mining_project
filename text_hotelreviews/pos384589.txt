excellent location walking distance to the central station river cruise ship dockings dam square shopping and many of amsterdam s other attractions we did a lot of walking at different times of the day and the immediate area felt safe always lots of people out and about while the room was small by north american standards it was very comfortable with a queen size bed had a small coffee pot and kettle it was clean had lots of hot water and interesting decor i would definitely recommend and stay there again
