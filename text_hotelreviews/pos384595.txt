our stay at the ink hotel was delightful the location is very central an easy walk to the train station and there is a gbv tram stop right outside the front door the staff was quite helpful and pleasant when we checked in they were having system problems but they worked quickly to resolve them we were in room for our thirteen night stay which was marvelous it has a high pitched ceiling with exposed beams it was almost like staying in a beautifully renovated dutch apartment it was extremely quiet and the bed was very comfortable the wifi throughout the hotel is quite fast one of the employees sri was especially welcoming and friendly he gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and we always enjoyed interacting with him when entering or leaving the hotel
