we chose this hotel as it had an elevator for our on the guests in our party the design of the hotel was very modern sleek and brilliantly themed to reflect the previous history of the building as a newspaper office the location was great minutes walk from the central station but far away enough to avoid the noise of the main station buses trams the room was modern clean luxurious very big comfy double bed breakfast was lovely tea coffee juices hot bacon eggs etc cereals pastries cheese meats fish we added this on when we arrived for each which is a little pricey but very nice with great quick service from the staff
