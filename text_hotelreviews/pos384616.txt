we absolutely loved this boutique hotel the location is fantastic especially for first time visitors to amsterdam it is close to amsterdam central station and has trams directly out the front which are frequent and easy to use the staff are friendly and went our of their way to make our stay unforgettable special mention to guest service manager who made my son s birthday holiday so wonderful our twin room was small but comfortable the bed and pillows were amazing and it was very clean we loved our view of the amsterdam rooftops and listening to the church bells ring breakfast was good plenty of choice and a lovely environment although a little expensive but standard price for a good hotel we would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heart beat
