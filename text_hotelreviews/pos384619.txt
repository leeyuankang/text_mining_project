beautiful layout lovely staff comfy beds the place was just beautiful a little out the way so your not sat directly on the main high street so your not kept awake by noise all night but only a road away so that in a min walk your slap bang in the centre its a perfect little location staff where helpful and understanding the place was incredibly clean and they lay out was perfect very easy to find i really would recommend this hotel to anyone its classy chic and cool
