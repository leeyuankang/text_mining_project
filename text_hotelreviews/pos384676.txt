the beds were extra comfy the breakfast choice was fantastic the quality of the actual food was delicious overall the hotel are very accommodating i asked for champagne glasses and they came along with some ice when my bag broke i needed help with a mini screw driver to fix this all these little extra things to help make my stay comfortable and enjoyable was an absolute pleasure
