we stayed at ink prior to a viking christmas markets cruise it was wonderful centrally located to everything we wanted to visit lovely restaurant bar where we enjoyed a great breakfast each morning along with some of the best coffee we ve ever had and finished the day with a cocktail or two before turning in for the evening our room was spotlessly clean with a super comfortable bed and the staff were incomparably professional friendly and helpful they intervened in our frantic efforts to locate our delayed luggage contacting local airline representatives to get immediate answers about when we could expect delivery through their help we received our luggage before we had to depart on our cruise this hotel does indeed deserve an exceptional rating across the board
