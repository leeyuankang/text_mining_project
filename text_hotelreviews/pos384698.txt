i liked the warm welcome from the staff very helpful with answering any questions the coffee machine in the room was a great thing to have for a pick me up without much hassle or physical movement at all the open plan bathroom with the glass windows was a great way to give the feeling of more space than there actually was also bringing more light into the room the free slippers and also the free refreshing fruited water in the lobby the blind on the roof window was easy to use and worked well including the window itself when wanting to view outside and see as much from the rooftops as possible the bed had many pillows and cushions for making yourself very comfortable and relaxed the mattress duvet and sheets were so soft that you d had trouble to get up to turn off the alarm clock which is only a short stretch away the rooms main wall was very instructive and knowledgeable as well as the magazine accompanying it placed on the bedside table from an artist who s work is very interesting
