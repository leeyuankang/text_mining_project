the hotel was very central and within easy walking distance to places of interest within the old town an excellent tram service was available right outside the main entrance with only one stop to the main railway station food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was absolutely excellent the latter could have been michelin starred it was so good very unusual decor inside which i found very interesting as the interior designer had introduced all kinds of typographics to echo the previoususe of the building as a newspaper office
