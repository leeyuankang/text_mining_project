the ink is conveniently located with less than a walk to central station and a min walk to dam square good tram links from both the staff at reception were so helpful with queries about public transport good restaurants nearby storing luggage etc even help printing out boarding cards prior to departure breakfast is superb and most definitely worth including in the room rate everything about the hotel is lovely comfy beds and quiet rooms with plenty of personal touches upstairs and down my teenage son thought it was brilliant too a real oasis to return to after a busy day sightseeing if returning to ams i would definitely choose to stay here again
