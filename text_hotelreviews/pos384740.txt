we went to amsterdam as part of our honeymoon my husband was skeptical about letting me choose the hotel we stayed in since i am the frugal one but we were both blown away with the service we received the staff decorated our room with a ton chocolate hearts everywhere there was even a rose and a champagne bottle waiting for us everyone was incredibly friendly and always smiling the breakfast was delicious the coffee was incredible i am a vegetarian and my husband is pure carnivore and we were both very happy we went back for breakfast everyday it was so good including after going out to find somewhere new we returned to the hotel for the breakfast we really wanted the atmosphere is great and the design is unique and so cool we loved our stay and miss amsterdam already
