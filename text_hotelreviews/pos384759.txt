hotel was very secure rooms were compact but had all the amenities beds were very comfortable the staff were extremely helpful and knowledgable helping all the tourists navigate amsterdam great location walking distance to dame square with transportation available in front of building minute train ride from airport to dame square i m sorry we didn t accept the breakfast offer as it would have been much more value for our dollar as they offer a buffet with unlimited choices and coffee would definitely stay here again
