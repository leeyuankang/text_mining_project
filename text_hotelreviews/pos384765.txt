one of the nicest hotels i ve stayed at i noticed it has won an award for best amsterdam hotel in and i m not surprised staff are very helpful wifi is excellent the whole place is really clean bed and shower are excellent too breakfast was great with friendly service step out of the hotel cross the road and keep heading west on foot and in five minutes you are in jordaan a wonderfully picturesque area with small cafes and shops and atmospheric streets one of the main shopping streets with high shops like zara and h m but also hema which has nice stationary and stamps which make great presents for kids runs along the rear of the hotel handy but rather generic i walked everywhere museum district is minutes so after an exhausting day it was great to return to such a nice place and just minutes on foot from central station
