the room was so small we could hardly fit our suitcases in the room and the bathroom door gave you no privacy when you were using the toilet i was disappointed as it was very expensive not value for money i would not reccomend this hotel we have stayed at other hotels in amsterdam cheaper and times better and in really good locations
