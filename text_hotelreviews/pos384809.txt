love the hotel unique and very well designed who ever did the interior they are very very talented the staff were super friendly we didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on the food but the bar staff did a very good gin and tonic the bed and bedding were good quality and very comfy would defiantly stay here again if we ever go back to amsterdam
