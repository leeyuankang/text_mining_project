beautiful hotel gorgeous interior clean smells amazing staff are so friendly and accommodating it is an expensive hotel but i would definitely stay there again worth the money the location was absolutely perfect too no more than a minute walk away from everything apart from the museum quarter which was accessed by the tram stop directly outside the hotel
