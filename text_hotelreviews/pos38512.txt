the room was quite spacious they provided a fan as it was very hot breakfast was good and we didn t have to queue up for it as you often do on a weekend the tube station right by the hotel is presently closed but two others are close by hotel is near the busy bayswater road but far enough off to be quiet easy to get around the main parts of london
