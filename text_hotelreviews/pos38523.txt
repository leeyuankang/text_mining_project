i loved this hotel my room was always kept wonderfully clean and the staff was friendly and helpful what i loved best is that it was so close to several tube and bus stations with paddington being only a ten minute walk away there are lots of restaurants small stores and souvenir shops within a block or two from the hotel hyde park is very close and it was just beautiful a great place to go have lunch or just sit and enjoy the park i would definitely stay here again
