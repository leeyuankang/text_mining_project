the best feature of the hotel is its staff trully friendly kindest ladies especially those in charge of the breakfast breakfast was ok and the room was quiet despite facing a very populated pub it requires some walking to reach the hotel from paddington station but location is very convenient to enjoy the beauty of hyde park
