verything was perfect during my stay in the best western mornington hotel the room was enough spacious for one person clean tidy with a newly renovated modern bathroom the breakfast was adequate to my needs and had a fair share of options to choose from it s placement came in very handy considering that my flight landed in heathrow and i managed to get to the hotel very easily with heathrow express and then a minute walk from paddington station to lancaster gate street it s also very close to the center and you can access it through the queensway metro station bus and taxis which the reception can book for you in advance last but not least the girls in the reception were all extremely polite helpful and very professional extra props to laura for keeping me company while i was eating my dinner the last afternoon and her beef lasagna suggestion thank you if i visit london i will sure book my room here again
