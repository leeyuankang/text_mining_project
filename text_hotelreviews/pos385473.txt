comfy bed good sized bathroom and i always enjoy my stay more when there is a choice of bath or shower i particularly sought out hotels that provide a kettle because not all hotels do so i was pleased to have tea making facilities and a fridge in the room the location if superb to minutes on a tram from central station tram stop very close to the hotel with trams to all the main sights in the city and the hotel is about min walk from the canal network the hotel is in a very busy location with ample shops bars and eateries in the immediate area i did appreciate the provision of a computer for guests to use in the hotel lounge great for searching out places to go and i did appreciate the free printing for printing off my airline boarding pass at the end of my stay decent choice at breakfast
