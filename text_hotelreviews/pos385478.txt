very convenient in the city center and close to everything there are many very good restaurants within seconds to minute walking times we enjoyed the breakfast buffet fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent a variety of cold meats as well as cooked the wonderful flakey buttery croissants and fresh fruits and coffee machine nice staff was very helpful and friendly they made nearby restaurant recommendations which we enjoyed tour arrangements can be made easily at the front desk nice warm fire in the bar lounge on cold nights
