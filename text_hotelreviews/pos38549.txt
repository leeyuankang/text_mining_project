hyde park is so pretty we loved how close this hotel is to the park there s a small hour bar in the hotel which was convenient we received an unexpected upgrade to a loft room it was very easy to arrive at heathrow airport take the heathrow express train to paddington station then a short walk to the hotel the mitre pub around the corner from the hotel was great too
