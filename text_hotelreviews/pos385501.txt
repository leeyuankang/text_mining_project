this hotel was absolutely wonderful location is so central the staff were amazing attentive and helpful hotel room was on the floor at the back so was very quiet perfect if you re going for a big dance event you can sleep well afterwards as the hotel room had black out curtains all in all a superb hotel i will be booking again when i go back to amsterdam
