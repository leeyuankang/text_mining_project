the location is excellent its close to most tourist attractions and is only a short walk from the central train station there are heaps of different restaurants close by to choose from the hotel staff was great and very helpful the elevators require room cards to access so its a safe stay for those with concerns the shower was great with loads of hot water and there is a self serve laundry within a min walk from the hotel
