i can honestly say this hotel is ideal and i wouldn t stay anywhere else in amsterdam this was our fourth stay there and we wouldn t hesitate to return the rooms are clean with everything you would require the staff are friendly and helpful particularly the young barman who is so friendly and accommodating the location is ideal being in a slightly quieter are but still within minutes walk of the centre finally the bar are is lovely particularly on a cold winters day
