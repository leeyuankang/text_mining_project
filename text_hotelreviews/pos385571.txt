the staff were very friendly and helpful we were able to leave our bags with them as we arrived before our check in time which meant we could go out without our bags the room was really good very comfy and quite spacious the bathroom and bedroom was very clean with a large comfy bed the bar tender idris was very entertaining and we enjoyed our conversations with him the location of the hotel is very good a short walk from amsterdam central station and is central to the shops and restaurants overall we enjoyed our stay
