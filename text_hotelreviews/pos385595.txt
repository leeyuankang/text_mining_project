excellent staff great location but somehow i just felt the hotel looked a little tired perhaps it s time for a decor refresh the reception team are great i received a free upgrade but i am worried that the price points are becoming very high it s an amstedam wide problem though the concierge was particularly helpful to be praised the breakfast was good fresh orange juice great and excellent bread and eggs the location is great so if the price is right you won t be disappointed
