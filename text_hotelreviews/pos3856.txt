we generally loved this hotel we d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in bloomsbury before so we thought we d try staying there the location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from heathrow was do able the hotel s victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room the staff was very helpful
