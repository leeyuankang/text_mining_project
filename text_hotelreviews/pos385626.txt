i have lost count of the number of times i have stayed at this hotel it is always my first choice when staying in amsterdam fantastic location friendly staff and lovely clean rooms parking is very expensive in amsterdam but the hotel offers discount on the secure underground car park opposite the hotel entrance a real bonus
