i had a top notch experience here the staff were very friendly efficient and courteous check in was smooth my room was clean comfortable and quiet the location is outstanding when i travel i don t linger in the hotel i get out and experience the city so i m not interested in fancy extras i just want a safe and clean place to sleep at night that being said this property was way more than safe and clean it was a pleasant and comfortable environment to start and end my days good amenities like wi fi plentiful hot water decent toiletries and quality breakfast coffee were among the many attributes that made my stay so positive
