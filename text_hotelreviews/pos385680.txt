this hotel gave us such an amazing experience in amsterdam first off the staff were extremely polite and helpful always smiling and helping with little things the actual hotel and facilities was excellent very clean big room and bed very nice lobby and lounge and the rooms were very quiet could not hear any outside noise located very close to the main popular areas including dam square and red light district also very easy to navigate around the town i very much recommend this hotel will deffo stay here again when i come back
