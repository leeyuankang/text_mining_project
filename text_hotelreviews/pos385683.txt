i was travelling with my year old daughter so location safety and facilities were very important to me and i have to say i was not disappointed it is centrally located near dam square and has easily accessible transit tram buses that lead to all the touristy spots it is easy to get to from the airport as well the rooms are cleverly layed out maximising space and very clean the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful the area is very nice and i felt safe walking around with my daughter i would highly recommend this hotel to all
