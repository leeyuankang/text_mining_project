the staff were particularly friendly and helpful it was our wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in we were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day this was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit
