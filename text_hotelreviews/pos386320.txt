amazing customer service i booked the most basic room for my boyfriend s birthday and when checking in they upgraded us so our room included a large private balcony the room was very clean and they were very accommodating with my pre stay requests room service is really pricey but the food drinks are great hotel bar is open late the location is very central london in walking distance of great landmarks really enjoyed our stay highly recommend
