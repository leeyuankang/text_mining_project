our deluxe king room with balcony was a tight fit for the portable crib for our son but otherwise a wonderful room the staff multiple times told us that milk for our son was complimentary and to just ask we also had great help with getting our luggage to and from the room the location is right next to the entrance to the tower of london and tower bridge is just a short minute walk down along the river thames there s also a tesco only a short distance away for grocery basics there hotel is undergoing construction but the noise wasn t an issue in our room finding the hotel seemed to be a challenge for some uber drivers and the airport service due to a left lane closure that forced drivers around the block
