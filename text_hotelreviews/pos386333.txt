the location is excellent just minutes walk from the tower of london underground and dlr stations the staff are friendly and very helpful for example they arrange a taxi back from a late show for us at very short notice the hotel itself has a clean modern look with comfortable rooms that match the photos the rubber duck in the bathroom and chocolates in the room on arrival were a nice touch
