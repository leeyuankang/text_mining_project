amazing place right by the tower bridge and tower of london lots of local pubs around for entertainment as well as great food very close to tower hill metro station so can get to any part of the city needed in under half an hour the staff was probably the best part everyone smiled and told you good morning they were super helpful when we needed to find something and our room was one of the nicer ones i ve stayed in do yourself a favor and book this place if there is a room available
