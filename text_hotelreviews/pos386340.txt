we liked the location also it was very quiet on night so we slept well just thought the price of the hotel was quite expensive and it didn t include a breakfast but i guess thats london for you we asked for a nice view on the e mail request box but the person at the check in desk had us down for a high floor request very amusing lovely time there though
