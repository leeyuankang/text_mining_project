i liked the personal attention of the staff to the guests the receptionists were very helpful even when we had to change rooms and solution oriented the room was refreshed daily including bed linen and sheets amenities restocked on a daily basis quiet rooms with good lighting and equipment and the location of the establishment is ideal close to main attractions business offices and public transportation
