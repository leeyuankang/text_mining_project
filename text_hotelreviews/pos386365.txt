it is in an excellent location mins from tower hill station to tower of london it is a business district so it is relatively quiet area which suited us fine very quick check in we got the room we asked for large bathroom with both bathtub and walk in shower toiletries and hairdryer provided complimentary water teas and biscuits in the room breakfast we thought was too expensive for a buffet breakfast but there were cafes around for cheaper breakfast all bar one wheterspoons starbucks etc we had dinner from the restaurant one of the evenings and it was of good quality we also received a complimentary late check out
