hotel russell is my preferred hotel in london the piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel russell station and then you are in the central part of london close to the british museum and many historic sites the hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations the only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan
