from the netherlands my mother and i went on a weekend trip away to london for her birthday we loved it the hotel was located very conveniently next to the tower bridge and tower hill metro station which made it very easy to travel to the rest of the city the hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable also enjoyed taking a bath after a long day of walking through the city but what stood out the most surprising us with chocolates and a personal note by the manager saying happy birthday mom couldn t have wished for a better weekend away
