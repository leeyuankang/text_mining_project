the welcome from the staff anna on reception was exceptionally great our room wasn t ready she told us to come back n an hour when we did she had upgraded us to a junior suite as it was also our wedding anniversary this made our stay even more comfortable room was great and she had even organised a treat in the room which was lovely we didn t have breakfast but our impression of hotel and staff were this hotel is located beside tower hill tube station overlooking tower bridge and beside a beautiful garden which is lovely to sit n rekax in
