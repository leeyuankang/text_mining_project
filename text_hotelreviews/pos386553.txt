the location is really good and the room was very comfortable room we enjoyed the tea and coffee facilities plus the lovely biscuits and sweets the bed was really comfy and the room had a sofa and large tv with good coverage staff were friendly and approachable it was my birthday and they brought a cake with candles to our room and there were balloons left in the room which was a nice touch
