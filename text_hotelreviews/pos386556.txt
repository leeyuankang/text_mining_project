the service from the staff was excellent and the gentleman went over and beyond the call of duty thanks to the owner on duty who came to meet me in my car when i couldn t locate hotel due to roads being blocked by road works i also liked that i was upgraded to a room on first floor as had previously spent an hour driving around trying to get access into road leading to hotel the location was very close to the place i was attending that evening i loved my room it was clean and very nice and spacious the bed was very comfortable
