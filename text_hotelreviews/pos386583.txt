the hotel was beautiful and felt very luxurious it was in a great location for what we had planned and close to a tube station on previous trips to london noise pollution has been an issue at other hotels but not here the staff were very lovely helpful and efficient the room was bigger than we expected and had top quality facilities and complimentary items very clean and the house keeping staff were very efficient we didn t try the bar or restaurant as we had already made plans but it looked and smelt lovely the window directly above the bed was a lovely touch we also loved the rubber duck competition he has come home with us ready for us to take snaps
