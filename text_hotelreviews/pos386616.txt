our second time at this hotel it s a minute walk to the tower of london tower bridge which is the key point for us good tube connections from tower bridge tube which is also under a minute walk lots of restaurants and bars due to the tower so no shortage of options head a little further afield and you re in the city of london so lots of higher end options as well the hotel has a really good level of comfort and facilities beds are huge and comfy large screen tvs for that down time and good free wifi bathrooms are spacious and well equipped with toiletries room service was very accommodating for off menu requests on the occasion we used it be happy to stay again when i need to be that side of london
