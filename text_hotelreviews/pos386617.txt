the staff was kind and wonderful i ve had a credit card problem the day i got there but they kindly let me pay for half in cash and pay the rest later once i ve found an atm and got it the room was extremely comfortable the complimentary water tea and biscuits were great it s very close to the tower of london and tower hill station just a few minutes walk a perfect experience
