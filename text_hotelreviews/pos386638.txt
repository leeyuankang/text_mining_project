we loved the location of this hotel in only a few minutes walk from the tower of london and the nearest tube an extremely comfortable room although we only had the basic city room no view other than an internal courtyard but hence very quiet lovely quality complimentary toiletries as well as water and tea coffee hot chocolate and biscuits replenished every day bed linen changed very regularly too staff were lovely as well
