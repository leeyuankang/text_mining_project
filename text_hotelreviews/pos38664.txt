location and size of room were excellent i had stayed at other hotels in the paddington area and the rooms were so small that you couldn t even move the proximity to paddington makes for a smooth ride to and from heathrow just remember that you can take the heathrow connect for pounds instead of the express which will cost you double the price lots of breakfast options around tube and hyde park within minutes overall a great hotel we will definitely go back
