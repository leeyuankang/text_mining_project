had a brilliant stay and would definately recommend room was modern and very clean loved the large tv and seating area had everything we needed great location and with hour room service it was perfect there aren t many places to go for drinks in the evening so you do have to travel if you want a night out tube station is just down the road so it s not inconvenient
