great weekend in london and the icing on the cake was the hotel and staff location was fantastic for the tower of london and we could see london bridge from our room room was very clean lovely facilities bath and separate shower free wifi water etc and everything was refreshed on our second day it was the little touches and attention to the detail that makes a difference which some hotels lack at london prices we thought the room was great value for money we are in the hospitality trade and have taken away a few great ideas ps love the duck
