amazing location very close to a lot of attractions i e london bridge tower of london etc the hotel room was quite large which is always a bonus the bathroom had a bath and a walk in shower which is simply awesome as a lot of hotels have only one or the other the staff is very friendly and helpful and i can probably keep going on but i think you get the picture
