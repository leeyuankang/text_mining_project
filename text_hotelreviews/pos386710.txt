beforehand i wasn t terribly excited that the kids would be sharing a fold out sofa but we didn t want to go too crazy on cost in london so we went with it anyway the place was very well kept the staff were extremely polite and helpful and they even set up the couch for us while we were out exploring so when we returned the children s bed was just as nice as ours the terrace was lovely the snacks were welcome location was great as we could go exploring very easily
