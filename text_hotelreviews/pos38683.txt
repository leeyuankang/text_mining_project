the man at reception was super friendly and extremely helpful we got upgraded to a small suite room and a discount on breakfast and of course a late check out time of we also were allowed to leave our bags whilst we shop next day for free our stay was made more memorable because of the great service will definitely visit again when i am in london again easy access to bus train station lancaster gate
