my room on the floor was well equipped good tv aircon bathrobe excellent toiletries ironing board nice bathroom small desk comfortable armchair small but comfortable bed good lighting all recently modernised except for the size the room had the standard of a luxury hotel you can see the attention to detail good library on the ground floor all the usual daily papers were available there the staff were helpful throughout friendly and attentive staff in the breakfast room in particular and a breakfast which left nothing to be desired what a good way to start the day whether on holiday or on business and i was there for five days making such things more important great location on a quiet side street but right next to tube stations lancaster gate or paddington and kensington gardens for early risers a good start to a sunny london day is to walk right from the hotel along the serpentine to hyde park corner buckingham palace and further sights at least two good pubs nearby not the cheapest place to stay but one gives the impression that it is well run which cannot be said of all london hotels i would in general much prefer a good private hotel to a chain
