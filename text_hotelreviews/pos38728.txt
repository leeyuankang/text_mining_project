good location close to the subway and hyde park hotel is not unique but clean and comfortable i had very good deal on a single room that is small and located in the basement but well equipped and it had a window i advise to have your breakfast in the sun at the terrace of the lunch room at the italian gardens in hyde park located next to the closest entrance of the park
