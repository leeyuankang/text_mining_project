we loved the location close to the canals dam square good dining and cute cafes as well as being within walking distance from many important museums the hotel is small enough so you don t get lost yet big enough to serve your traveling needs nice relaxing bar really nice breakfast area and comfortable rooms and general feel the staff was super helpful and the locals were ready to point us in the right direction when we got off the correct street or walkway we felt safe and secure as we sought out the treasures of amsterdam the mecure hotel amsterdam is a really nice affordable hotel in a really nice city
