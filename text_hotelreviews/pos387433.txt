location excellent especially for van gogh and rijks etc and heineken experience customer service was excellent we really appreciated the free use of the computer and printer in reception so we could check in and print boarding passes and tickets to attractions booked on line breakfast was very good with a wide variety of foods on offer we loved the cool machine which produces freshly squeezed orange juice room well decorated and very clean
