the room was great big and comfortable a very good bathroom but i think it was a good luck as i know there are different types of rooms the room was booked with a good discount if no discount offered rooms are expensive the personnel was wonderful hospital and friendly the breakfasts are various and delicious they can cook porridge or omelette by request wonderful location nice area close to the underground station and to kensington gardens minutes by walk
