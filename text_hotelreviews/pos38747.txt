the breakfast is really good a lovely selection the service exceptional especially the fair haired waitress the room had everything i needed and was squeaky clean the hotel is in easy walking distance of the bus route and tube stations the bed was fabulously comfortable there are comfy chairs and couches in the reception area and they are well used by the guests you do feel at home there i thoroughly enjoyed my stay there
