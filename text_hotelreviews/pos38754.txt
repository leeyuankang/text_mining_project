very good location near kensington gardens and just two blocks from the lancaster gate tube station very friendly and helpful staff taxi service arranged by the hotel to heathrow costs gbp to terminal and gbp to the other terminals much more convenient than using the tube and better value than using the heathrow express if there are two or more of you
