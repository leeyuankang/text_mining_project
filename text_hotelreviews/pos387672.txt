great location down a side street from la ramblas though the street itself looked a little run down extremely friendly and helpful reception staff nothing was a problem rooms well equiped and comfortable but decor a little on the minimalist side lovely amenity area behind reception with free refreshments no problem with wifi worked perfectly good variety at breakfast and nice coffee from the machine
