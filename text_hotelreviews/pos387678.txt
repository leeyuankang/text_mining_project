brilliiant location and even better as i was unaware it was pretty much next door to palau guell so as gaudi fans that was an added bonus hotel staff extremely helpful accomadative bed was big comfortable overall it was a very positive experience and very good value given the brilliant location but some fresh air would be nice overall a positive experience
