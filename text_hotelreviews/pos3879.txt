the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly the room was relatively big so i had space to move around the staff is super friendly and the location is perfect the tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus for example you might think that being close to kings cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least minutes and that s if you get the exit right switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location it s also located in front of russel square park which is very nice
