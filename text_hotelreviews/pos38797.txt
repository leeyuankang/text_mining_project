location right next to tube station lancaster gate and to hyde park very quiet area staff nice and helpful although when i asked what was more economic for the journey i had to make between private cab or a black cab i think the lady really knew what was cheaper but she wouldnt tell me overall very good and economic especially bc it s london and it s not easy to find a nice clean and well located place unless you re willing to pay a super expensive price
