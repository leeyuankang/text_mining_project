i loved the brightness airy feel to the room the decor was simple stylish every detail of the room had been thought out to perfection the dressing gown and slippers felt lovely as did the bed linen especially the pillow which was beautifully luxurious the best i ve ever laid my head on air conditioning just right and the location was great staff were very accommodating friendly and very helpful the best hotel room i ve ever stayed in
