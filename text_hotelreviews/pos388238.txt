the room was great very comfy bed and lots of nice touches the bathroom was lovely especially the shower i contacted the hotel to ask if at all possible we could have an upper floor room as me and my partner were celebrating her birthday and our anniversary i am happy to say they delivered and we had a view as well so was delighted
