the bed was very comfortable my first night at the hotel i wasn t feeling so good because of the heat i think something i ate before i got to the hotel but with the air con in the rooms and in the hotel its self made the stay pleasurable the staff were easy to deal with nothing was too much trouble for them and everything was done as quickly as possible with a smile i would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting the excel as i was for the weekend
