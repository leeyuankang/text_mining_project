we stayed at crowne plaza aloft and moxy aloft is by far the best not only because it is right next to the station and excel but also because the rooms are super big clean and modern great coffee in the room design that provides amazing view quick and friendly service amazing restaurant inside the hotel do not miss plus the pool and the gyms are an extra bonus it will be our first choice for london
