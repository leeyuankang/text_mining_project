the best part about the property is the location the hotel is literally connected to the local train service which is only minutes from central london you can walk from the hotel lift to the train in roughly minutes the amenities in the hotel itself were brilliant and exactly as they look in the pictures the gym is hours along with a snack area and reception the pool doesn t shut to and the bar stays open till what more could you want from a fantastic location and amazing property
