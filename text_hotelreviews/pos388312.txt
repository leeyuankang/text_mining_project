the twin bedded room was very spacious and comfy the self service food hub open all hours was so useful when returning late from meetings and needing a quick but healthy meal and choices for breakfast good and affordable reception staff and some of the canteen staff were very very friendly and helpful the option to decline housekeeping and get a voucher off food was good
