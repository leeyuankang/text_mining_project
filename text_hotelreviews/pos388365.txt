fantastic hotel with great staff the rooms are large and spotlessly clean this is a very modern hotel with everything you need for a great stay there are very good links to central london via dlr so don t let the location put you off i ve stayed in central london before and found it difficult to sleep due to outside noise but at the aloft it is very quiet i ve given maximum score for everything because that is what it deserves well done to all the staff they simply can t do enough for you
