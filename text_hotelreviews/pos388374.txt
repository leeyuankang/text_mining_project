everything was completely seamless we checked in quickly and had everything that we needed to know explained to us by friendly staff as it was the first time using this particular chain we also asked to use their bag store before checking in on the first day as we were early and after checking our on the last day as we were leaving london long past our checkout time and they were happy to store them for the duration for free with tags to denote which were ours this was really handy for us as the alternative would have been to stay an extra night the room was kept nice and neat as you should expect from a hotel they had sachets of filter coffee complete with disposable filters which was a refreshing change from instant coffee along with some twinings teas tea bags and a bottle of water these were a welcome change from instant coffee as we had early mornings and a lot of walking to do for the room itself they had a flat screen tv a wired internet connection hotel wide free wi fi an alarm clock with bluetooth and a mini fridge i didn t test the speed of the internet but it did just fine for the browsing that i was doing breakfast which came with my particular package was a nice variety there was a coffee machine for filtered coffee various juices english breakfast bits cereals fresh breads fruits pretty much something for everyone the value for money would have been higher but we stayed on a weekend that is always more expensive than normal days due to an event at excel which we went to and we picked a hotel that was physically linked to the building
