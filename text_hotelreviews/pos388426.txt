staff apologised for putting me in the disabled access rooms on the ground floor but in fact i was very happy with my room as it was very spacious and had a huge bathroom and showers food shop in foyer really helpful location of hotel right next to dlr was superb also the scheme whereby guests can save the planet and reduce wastage by opting for limited housekeeping visits in return for free food vouchers is an inspired idea and was very welcome
