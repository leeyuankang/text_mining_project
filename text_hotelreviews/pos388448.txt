it was a lovely hotel a bit prices compared to nearby hotels but the services were just fabulous i was sad i didn t get to go swimming in the pool but then that was down to busy me not making time in my busy schedule during my stay all in all the hotel was lovely staff were helpful and pleasant and the facilities were lovely would definitely book again if the price was just a bit lower to compete against the other hotels
