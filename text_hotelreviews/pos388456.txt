the bed was so comfy the hotel was beautifully designed with really modern decor a card operated lift was great so you could only get off at your own floor great location right next to the station with great views enroute to hotel although there was a few issues that could be improved slightly don t let this put you off i would certainly return to this hotel in a flash
