this might be the best hotel we ve stayed in to date really modern and clean and the location was great if you re okay with staying a bit out of the centre of london we didn t really need maid service and we were fine to reuse our towels so you just hang a sign on the door and you receive a food voucher the front desk staff were friendly and efficient and helped us out when we wanted to stay another night we stayed on the second floor and it leads out onto a terrace where you will find the entrance to the dlr so really convenient the pool is awesome and also has a sauna steam and a gym don t even hesitate just book this hotel
