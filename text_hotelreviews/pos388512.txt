plenty of space in the room for cases bags etc beds very comfy awesome views from the higher floors staff were very friendly and helpful loved the snack bar in the lobby bar was a great place to sit and chill of an evening and id recommend the pizzas as they were delicious very close to the excel centre and the dlr which was perfect for us
