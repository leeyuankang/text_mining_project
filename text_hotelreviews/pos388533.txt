fantastic modern hotel with clean good size room facilities where great swimming pool and qym a bonus was excellent to refresh you in the morning we stayed there as we where going to a show in the and was a great location with trains stopping outside the hotel to get to the centre of london but is walking distance to the staff where also very friendly and helpful with directions and stuff would stay here again no problem will definitely use this hotel every time i m in london stars
