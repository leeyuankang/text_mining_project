it is in an excellent location for excel east london and the hotel is beautiful with excellent rooms and lovely comfy beds a few more hooks in the room would have been helpful as there is nowhere to hang your towels in spite of the fact that the airport is a mere stones throw away the sound proofing in the hotel is incredibly effective no noise whatsoever
