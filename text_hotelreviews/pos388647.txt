we have stayed in the hotel for only night because we had an early flight from london city airport with the taxi it was only minutes to the airport hotel is very modern bed was really good and the shower as well if you visit london for leisure purposes it is not the best location although the train will bring you quite fast to the city center but it is not a vibrant area staff is great very nice and pro active i like the atmosphere and i believe it is much better when staff is dressed like in this hotel informal but still representative
