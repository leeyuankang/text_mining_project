a really nice hotel with great interior huge rooms and friendly staff the beds are super comfortable and the shower is great the subway to the tower bridge closest sight in the inner city takes about from there you can get further into the city do some sights can take to reach we still found the quality of the hotel worth the extra journey we didn t book the breakfast option but had something from the grab n go every morning they offer sandwiches fresh fruit cereals and more we found it absolutely good value for money we paid about for two people if you don t need a full english breakfast we would definitely stay here again
