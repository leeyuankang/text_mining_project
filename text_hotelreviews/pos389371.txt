for a central london hotel it was never going to be cheap so putting that aside the staff were friendly attentive and knowledgeable the hotel is a delight bright colourful vibrant and so different from many other hotels in its class from the roof top bar to the bowling alley in the basement the hotel is beautifully decorated and visually amazing the location couldn t have been better for our visit to the theatre and from now on this is most definately my london hotel of choice a comfortable relaxing and friendly environment we loved it
