the warm cookies you get upon check in were fantastic the customer services was awesome the view on the floor facing the water and the city was breathtaking we were very close to everything great restaurants attractions transportation the price was a little high but would stay again for sure very spacious and suitable for children the apple tv set up was so innovative and they had plenty to watch for kids even though it was in dutch
