i loved everything about this hotel from the moment i arrived the front desk staff was welcoming and professional i requested a room with a view as i was staying for nights well they did not let me down i had a nice spacious executive queen room with floor to ceiling windows with a great view of the harbor and the city the room was a perfect size not cramped at all the apple computers were nice to use as well i travelled solo and did order room service often the food was excellent i ate upstairs at the sky lounge and that was awesome too i loved this hotel so much that i stayed a second time after visiting the uk during my amsterdam trip when i came back they reserved the previous room i stayed in so it felt like i was coming home i found that to be very thoughtful i will definitely stay here again when visiting amsterdam the proximity to the train station was great for visiting other cities for the day the surrounding neighborhood is great too and felt very safe
