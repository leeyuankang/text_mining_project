the guest services staff was super helpful they sent aspirin to my room in the middle of the night also a quart of milk and even programmed the throw away cellphone i bought to use in holland because the instructions were in dutch and chinese in terms of staffing the front desk had some of the friendliest people i ve met the hotel location is literally next door to central station which is also the terminus for both streetcars and the subway metro several bus routes also start in the plaza you can get day passes which provide access to all three transport modes from the guest services desk which charges your room account for the cost they even sent someone to kill a mosquito that had entered through the window i had opened i carry an epipen for my allegies
