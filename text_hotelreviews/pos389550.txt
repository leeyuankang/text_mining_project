the room was nice and clean we got a room on the floor with a fantastic view over amsterdam we could hear the music from the skylounge so don t get a room on the floor if this bothers you it played until atleast pm after that i fell asleep so don t know for how long it played the breakfast was also very nice with a wide selection and great choices the cookie we got when we checked in was awesome very good and warm location is perfect easy to walk to tram trains city etc you can also rent a bike at the hotel perfect as you then can cycle somewhere and all the way back to the hotel definitly recommend this hotel
