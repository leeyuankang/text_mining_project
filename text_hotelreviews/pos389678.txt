when we asked staff something out of went out of their way to answer or assist we asked for a lot of help when we arrived and they really were nice about it i normally check in and never ask for much we had connectivity issues with the wifi and it was a wild goose chase but they persisted and came back when things still were not resolved they were all helpful and cheerful and i was quite flustered trying to get online to attend a meeting with my office we asked for some advice on restaurants or asked them to make a reservation for one we wanted to try they were very helpful the food and beverage we had were very good also we had access to the executive lounge this was a great option for us because we stayed for nights we could have a nice place to sit and relax and at other times enjoy refreshments the hotel location was optimal we arrived at centraal station and easily made the walk over to the hotel with our luggage the sky lounge has a gorgeous view it is worth going up for a look it does get quite crowded up there enjoyed food and drink and looking out the window there
