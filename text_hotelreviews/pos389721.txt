the doubletree is a modern spotlessly clean ideally located hotel next to central station in amsterdam it is the outstanding staff however which makes this hotel exceptional my sister had an unfortunate fall the first day of our vacation at the doubletree and the staff could not have been more attentive helpful and considerate they went above and beyond to secure medical and dental care for her and to ensure our comfort throughout our pre cruise stay
