staff was very friendly the hotel is located very close to central station so getting to and from the airport is a breeze you are a little out of the way from the main hustle and bustle of the city this can be good for getting away from the noise but bad for adding an extra minute walking commute to top sites the sky lounge was a great hangout spot with wonderful views of the city great place to watch the sunset friday evening was very busy and so was sunday when we stopped in for a quick drink hotel helped with tickets to some top sites and also gave us some great suggestions for late night partying
