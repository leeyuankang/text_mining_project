the staff at the hotel went above and beyond from the get go when we arrived at the hotel on friday evening upon signing in they presented me and my other half a warm cookie wow who does that i thought that was amazing to our surprise they even decorated our room with birthday banners and confetti during the second day upon returning to the hotel we was greeted with a bottle of wine two glasses a birthday card from the hotel and a giant birthday chocolate cookie cake on all days at the reception they gave us free bottles of water and apples which i felt was really considerate the view from our room was also amazing and the hotel itself is right by the river the train station is a second walk away to which made the hotel easy to locate and to get to
