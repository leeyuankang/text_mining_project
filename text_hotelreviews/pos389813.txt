very nice skylounge bar very good staff there drinks were pricy but still fair good value for money there and its really a cool bar with lots of people and music and a great view of the city location of this property is really great just next to the centraal station in amsterdam mac instead of tv is really practical as you can watch tv and use it to research places to go etc rooms comfortable and nice lobby we got free cookies on check in which was quite cool
