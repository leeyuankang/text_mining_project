the smiling nature of the staff be it the front desk to the concierge to the people serving the breakfast buffet me and my wife travelled for our honeymoon to europe and we stayed in double tree hilton in mar the breakfast buffet has a huge spread with decent quantity offerings in vegetarian and non vegetarian food the front desk staff gave us a complimentary bottle of wine as a gesture for spending our honeymoon at their hotel the rooms were graciously adorned with pretty good views of the city and the waterfront the hotel is a min walk from the amsterdam centraal station which is the main station connecting amsterdam with major cities in europe all the people were wonderfully friendly and i would definitely recommend this is as the best place to stay in amsterdam you are bound to walk away with a broad smile on your face once you have stayed at this hotel
