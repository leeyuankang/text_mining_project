very pleasant and accommodating staff i had to make several updates to my reservation due to schedule changes during my stay further they have very flexible liberal pet policy at this hotel which is a differentiator for me i stayed here years ago and had same experience this time same pleasant stay still love sky lounge room service was fast and food reasonable and good
