ideal location for a first time visit to amsterdam staff were very helpful and knowledgable for directions and supplied maps we also forgot to take continental plugs and after a quick call to reception a member of staff was at the door with one in minutes free of charge hotels interior presentation is stylish but comfortable and we felt very relaxed and safe in bar restaurant areas guest rooms that include the use of the executive lounge are well worth the extra for the evening drinks and snacks there is also hr tea coffee they also supply complimentary bottles of water and apples at reception aswell as warm cookies as you check in an added little touch to start your holiday with
