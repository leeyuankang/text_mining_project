the staff was super friendly and helpful they were able to make reservations at every restaurant we requested it was also my birthday and they left a little gift for me in the room it was also really convenient for public transportation our room had a beautiful view of the city we also had a computer which doubled as the tv if the wireless seemed slow we just jumped on the computer to look up directions and restaurants all in all we would be happy to stay here again
