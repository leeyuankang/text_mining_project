a nice warm welcome from lesley on reception including a warm chocolate chip cookie always nice after a journey very easy to get to from the airport short train trip and about minutes stroll location is fab easy to wander into the tourist areas but far enough out to not be in a crowd of party goers all the time room not the biggest but nicely furnished and a free apple mac pc tv free water and apples fruit i ve stayed in hiltons all round the world over years and for the first time ever someone knocked on my door and unprompted asked if i was happy with the cleaning the sky lounge is fantastic and as well as serving nice drinks and complimentary popcorn has an amazing panoramic view over the city much better than the one everyone talks about at the library overall i d recommend to anyone and will use it next time i come to amsterdam
