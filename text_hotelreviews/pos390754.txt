staff were very friendly and extremely accomodating my room was upgraded to a junior suite very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable neither very hard nor soft breakfast was delicious with an assortment of croissants and rolls fresh fruit and veggies plus cereal eggs sausages and more air conditioning worked very well this hotel is close to a lot of the museums and parks and quite close to the subway as well
