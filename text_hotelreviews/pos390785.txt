the breakfast was above par and the staff is incredible they were so friendly and willing to help direct me to all the places i wanted to go they were accommodating and expressed an obvious desire to provide the best customer service and were even sensitive to my dietary needs as well the location is also prefect for the main attractions of inner stradt metro neuermarkt which was an superb suggestion by the manager
