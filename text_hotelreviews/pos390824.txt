it is a small hotel and the staff soon know who you are and were very helpful the breakfast room was beautiful and the food excellent the entrance and lobby don t give a good idea of how nice the rest of the hotel is my room was huge and my only grumble that it was too echo y and would have benefitted from more pictures or hangings on the walls i understand why it is easier not to have a carpeted floor
