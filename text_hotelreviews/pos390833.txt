location was great just a couple of steps to the subway which offers fast connections to every part of the city the main sights of vienna such as stephansdom hofburg palace etc are all within walking distance though the staff was very helpful and polite and made us feel comfortable we even got a free upgrade to a junior suite which was great the breakfast was good and everything was fresh but we d like it to be more various another positive thing is that they accept pets so you don t need to worry about them
