we often visit vienna but last week was the first time we stayed in das opernring hotel we really like the location across from the opera minutes walk to downtown vienna room and bathroom are very spacious and very clean it was extremely hot last week in vienna and the first night my husband got sick i asked the hotel to cancel the night because we wanted to get home asap and the hotel was kind enough to reimburse our second night as we had already paid for it in advance i ve never experienced this professionalism in any other hotel so thanks again for your kind gesture special thanks to harald and kyle
