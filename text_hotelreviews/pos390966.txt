we stayed in room the room was clean and the hotel was very quiet at night the staff were friendly and helpful we stayed nights and the breakfast was very good we didn t use the gym or pool but can see if people would be upset as pool is quite small x maybe the neighbourhood is safe and the hotel is close to both tram and train lines
