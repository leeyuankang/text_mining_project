the hotel was pretty good the room was big with comfortable bed but almost uncomfortable pillows the bathroom is a little bit small and with a smell the breakfast you won t be hungry there are hot dishes yogurts possibility to make sandwich etc but the meat for sandwiches wasn t fresh the same with all fruits they were acescent the coffee capuchino from coffee machine were instant the parking we left the request for the parking place but it wasn t accepted and when we came there were no places but the lady from the reception told us about the parking in m near the hotel and the hotel blocks money on your card so ask them to unblock to avoid double payment
