the bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast was awesome a lot of things to choose from waiters were replacing the empty trays constantly the personnel were very nice and willing to speak any language the location is fine about mins walking from the center which granted a calm area with less noise public transport and taxi service works great around the hotel s location a complete variety of bathroom items was provided thank you for everything
