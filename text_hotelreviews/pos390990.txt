breakfast was very good though juice tasted like it was more artificial and not natural staff was very eager to help and friendly they acknowledged my claims and gave me support to make me feel a little more confident close proximity to city center if you just look for an accommodation to stay and sleep it is ok don t expect more in regard of a calm tidy pleasant room the comfort level is between a little bit better than a hostel with the bonus of having relatively privacy see the cons for more detail price should be around euro a day more is a joke
