the staff is super nice and welcoming i arrived and they gave me a room at the top floor but it wasn t soundproofing i could hear the street noises like i was actually in the sidewalk so o called the reception to change my room and they did it no problems and with all the kindness the rooms are very comfy and the beds too the bathroom is clean and they give you lots of toiletries they a sample gym and pool but they are good and i think it s enough for nights staying at the hotel i would recommend for sure
