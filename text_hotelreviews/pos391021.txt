our stay at hotel exe vienna was a really good experience the reception staff was friendly and nice and we received a nice comfortable and clean room at the floor the room had a backyard view but this was not a problem since the high floor offered a pretty good view of the city skyline and plenty of light entered the room the room was well kept with regard to the furniture sheets and so on oh and the breakfast a more that great breakfast for euros with tortilla de patatas scrambled eggs sausage vegetables cheese coffee tea juice types of bread sweets and many more
