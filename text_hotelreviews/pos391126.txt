me and my friend had a warm welcome on our arrival thank you very much we received a room on the floor as requested an upper floor but not the last one the room was quite large and it included armchairs a sofa and an extra table we liked that we had a refrigerator and a kettle for making tea which was not included in the presentation every item seemed new and perfectly clean spotless we had a nice view from the window we had good quality items in the bathroom the twin beds were absolutely comfortable nice welcoming chocolates on the table a place for storing luggage at the ground floor sufficient number of electric sockets more than in other places the breakfast was served at convenient hours it was extremely varied and we could eat very well on every occasion but it was not changed from day to day that was not a problem the wifi internet worked quite well in the room to my surprise the swimming pool that is free for all the guests during the last night in vienna on a monday i needed some help with finding an open pharmacy drugstore at not quite a late hour the receptionist a man different from the woman who welcomed us was helpful and directed me to a hour drugstore in the neighborhood after i had struggled for minutes in vain to find one or at least a shop selling what i needed on foot this must be one of the few downsides of vienna you cannot expect an ordinary shop to be open at pm in the weekdays i find this unbelievable if you come to my country in a big city expect to be able to buy the simplest things close to midnight on weekdays i wonder how do the viennese cope with a medical emergency at home if by accident they forget to stack themselves with basic medicines the english spoken by the staff was very good the hotel management responded in a timely manner to my e mails
