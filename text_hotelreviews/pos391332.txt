it was an easy process getting from airport with the shuttle bus which took mins the hotel is surrounded by beautiful park lands and water ways to walk jog bike ride swim or have a picnic the bus station is out the front and takes min to get to canals in the city center free bar service in room was a treat also breakfast was nice if booking room ask for view over the park rather than the freeway
