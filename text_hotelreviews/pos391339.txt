the bed was really comfortable room was clean and it was nice that it was a bit away from the city center and near a nice park and lake the bus stop was also just around the corner though we rented bikes in town and just biked to and from the hotel during our weekend stay the breakfast buffet was also very good with small pancakes fresh orange juice machine and variety of breads and yogurts the staff at the reception was nice and friendly
