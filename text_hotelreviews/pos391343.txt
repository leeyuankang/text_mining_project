very clean and comfortable lovely views even though your near a main road but looking out seen lovely green grass and rabbits running about it was so relaxing the bed was very comfortable maybe to soft of some people as you just sank in to the bed shower had good pressure so was nice to have lovely hot water pick up with the hotels shuttle was very easy once you figure out where your at check in was simple enough
