the room was very clean and luxurious all the facilities in the room worked perfectly and there was a free wifi which was very useful in order to plan the journey around amsterdam the staff was very helpful with tourist information and gladly answered all to all the questions we had about our stay and advised us about the trip around amsterdam one of the greatest perks of the hotel is the lake on the other side of the road overall great location amazing apartments and helpful staff members
