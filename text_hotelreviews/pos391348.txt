the hotel was lovely clean towels changed daily bedding re made every day toiletries replenished daily had black out curtains had free transfer to and from airport although not in the city they gave us help with bus or travel into city with a discount deal on busses and also the bus stop was literally minute walk away from hotel the food was amazing not cheap but you get what you pay for the bus is about mins but takes you right into centre where it is easy accessible we didn t get discount for bus travel so cost us a day for a return to city centre near a massive lake which is nice to walk around
