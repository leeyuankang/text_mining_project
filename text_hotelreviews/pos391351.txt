the room was beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable ive had in a hotel could have been a little closer to the city centre but i was glad we booked this hotel you get to see more of the city than if you stayed closer in only downside when your walking to get the bus into the city there is no real safe walk to the bus stop you have to walk through the petrol station and then cross a road to the other side and when your coming back your on the wrong side of the road they could make a pathway from the hotel on the hotel side to the bus stop for guests to have safer access to the bus stops but this is only a minor thing
