the room is very comfortable spacious and the bathroom is very clean there s onsite parking and it s just right next to petrol kiosk so it s very convenient to just walk out to buy snacks and food from the kiosk if you need you can also top up petrol just before you leave for your trips or to the airport it s a slight distance from the airport compared to another hotel airport that i stayed which was much nearer to the airport i actually preferred this better the luggage deposit service was good i can deposit my big luggages at ease and pick them up on my trip back i will stay at this hotel again if i come back
