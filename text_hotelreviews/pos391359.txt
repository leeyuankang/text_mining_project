although the hotel is not in the centre we preferred this very close to airport and lovely setting beside a huge lake we preferred being out of the bustle of the city and it certainly worked out cheaper bus no into centre is only that s a lot cheaper than a city centre hotel stay public transport is excellent and buses run every minutes and start early end late if you don t mind being on the outskirts then this hotel is ideal we got bus into museum area and then walked our way everywhere it means you see everything can explore all the shopping areas and little cafes etc location will not suit everyone but if you don t mind a minute bus trip then it s ideal if you want to be in the buzz of the city then this hotel is too isolated bed was amazingly comfortable and the shower strong with plenty of hot water bar area lovely but very quiet so if you looking entertained then this place is not for you
