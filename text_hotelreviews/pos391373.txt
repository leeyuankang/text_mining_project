very quiet location quiet and clean room there is nothing near by just greenery so you need to take taxis to get to restaurants and things but the price differential made it worth it its a minute taxi to the airport i didnt use the hotel s free shuttle it was a minute taxi to my meetings i recommend using uber as it was cheaper than the taxis and they were always not more than minutes away from the hotel i had a room in the back and it was silent
