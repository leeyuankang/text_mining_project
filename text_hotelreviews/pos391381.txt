the location is decent pretty quiet area there is a big park nearby great for a morning run not too far from the airport the rooms are really nice big comfortable bed clean nice bathroom ac tv free safe one of the better breakfasts we had all of us agreed to this two are vegetarians very well priced for what it offers at least in the period we were there beginning of april we payed euros room night i doubt you can find something better at this price in amsterdam also the breakfast was totally worth the price of euros for in the week ends you get a euros ticket for the bar restaurant menu each day you use the please do not clean the room sign we often do this anyway because cleaning the room and changing all the towels daily seems such a waste so it s not the euros i applaud but the initiative to encourage a more thoughtful approach from each of us
