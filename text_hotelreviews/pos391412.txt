they helped us with travel and answered our questions in the simplest way possible very helpful and friendly staff the location is not bad at all and transport was very easy the hotel looks great and our beds were extremely comfortable best bit about having a long day out in the city was coming back to soft and warm beds and knowing we would be well rested for the next day
