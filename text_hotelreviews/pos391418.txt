it was not very near from the city centre but it was never an issue there was a shuttle every minutes from the airport to the hotel so for the whole days of our trip whenever we are getting back to the hotel from exploring the centre we get down to the airport from centrale station and take the shuttle back to the hotel we also do the same in the morning shuttle to the airport then takes the train from there to wherever we want to go the staff was also very friendly and accomodating
