very comfortable beds clean room and bathroom very quiet location room is cleaned everyday and you get fresh towels whenever needed showergel and shampoo are free in the bathroom the only thing you must consider is that the hotel is located outside town in the middle of a green area the only shop in the area is a gas station close to the hotel but it was enough for our needs they have lots of snacks drinks and other items you might need as i said far away fom the city center but definitely not a problem if you don t need to go back to the hotel several times during the day from the airport the free shuttle takes you to the hotel in less than minutes and to reach the city center there s a bus stop for line which takes you to the museum area in no more than minutes
