i walked out of the airport located the shuttle and walked right on to it the location is about minutes from the airport the room was quiet despite being on the road side of the building and clean the bed was very comfortable i just needed a place to rest my head between flights not a place to stay while touring amsterdam and this served the purpose perfectly
