i greatly appreciated the free airport shuttle which i used for both of my visits this month when i had to get a taxi to the airport before the regular shuttle hours started i was surprised that it cost so much to go such a short distance that service represents a real savings the staff was extremely helpful and kind they went out of their way to make me feel at home and answered all my questions cheerfully there was also the option to rent a bike on site which i took advantage of doing i only had an afternoon and evening in amsterdam so exploring the beautiful countryside magnificent vondelpark and city center by bike was absolutely a delightful experience
