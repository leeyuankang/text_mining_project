absolutely amazing loved the idea of it being a luxury apartment more than a hotel because of the higher level of privacy you get given the room was stunning could not fault it at all i even e mailed the staff a few days before our arrival to explain it was my partners birthday so could they wish him a happy birthday but they made the effort to decorate the bedroom with balloons banners rose petals and swan towels simply sensational and my partner said it was the best birthday he had experienced every enquiry we had the staff were eager to help and were welcoming during the whole of our stay
