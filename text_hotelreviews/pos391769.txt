great staff and very comfortable hotel relative to other places ive stayed at in amsterdam location is also great not in the middle of everything but either short walk distance or taxi away from the busy streets minutes drive from pc so i love it either way great and above the standards i ve seen in amsterdam thus far i extended my stay and hoping for the same level of service to continue of course
