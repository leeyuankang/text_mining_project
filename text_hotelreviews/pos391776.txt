i travel to amsterdam frequently and only recently heard of this newer hotel and decided to book a stay for an overnight trip i was glad i did as this hotel is pretty amazing and the location couldn t be better we found the staff to be super friendly and helpful the room was very large and modern and the kitchen would be useful for longer stays again the location is the best the rooms are large and luxurious and the staff among the most friendly i have experienced in amsterdam
