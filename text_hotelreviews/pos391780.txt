we wrote to the hotel for specific requests smoking toom early arrival etc although they could not accommodate these our expectations were managed very tactfully we were greeted by mira who is extremely courteous friendly and very helpful we were served welcome drinks on arrival and check in took seconds mira drew out popular places to visit on a map and gave us loads of information that was very helpful our suite was beautiful overlooking the garden and we were served a bottle of champagne the hotel is tucked away in a quiet street which kept out the noise we were in the heart of the city and trams that would take you down to spui rembrandtplein dam square centraal was only a min walk the hotel only serves breakfast but there are several cafes and eateries on the main street they had a small but lovely breakfast spread and you can order eggs fresh pancakes overall the stay was very pleasant and we definitely recommend staying here
