luxury suites is an amazing place i am very familiar with amsterdam and visit a lot so i have stayed in many hotels and airbnb s the rooms are huge the views sweeping and grand the facilities are modern and sleek but extravagant at the same time the staff was unreal in terms of outreach responding to issues there was only one and attention to detail i hosted friends in my room for pre dinner cocktails and the royal suite was perfect the breakfast which i only ate on my last day was amazing i cheated myself not eating there every morning what a variety the location is ideal it is a little east of center so you have quick access to all the joys of amsterdam but a bit more peace and quiet at night lots of precious spots nearby to enjoy and so may spots to snap a great trip recording picture i must single out wladimir who was amazing my whole stay and even before in fact all the staff were great but he deserves a special acknowledgement i will return here again and again for my trips
