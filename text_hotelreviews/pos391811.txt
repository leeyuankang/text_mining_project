beautifully appointed bedroom suites with fabulously stocked fridges the staff were attentive and helpful and made wonderful recommendations for dinner the location is central to most of the districts and many attractions i would recommend a trip to some of the smaller boutique shopping districts such a de pijp jordans and pc hoofstraat the cheese and wine evening canal trip was also worth a punt overall a super hotel and trip
