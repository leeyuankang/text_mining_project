the hotel was beautiful the outdoor courtyard was lovely to spend some time in the bathrooms were amazing and the showers had lots of hot water and plenty of pressure luca the host at breakfast was a delight and the concierge was of great assistance on a couple of occasions the location is just perfect for the older and more central part of amsterdam and the hotel was a comforting oasis to come back and rest
