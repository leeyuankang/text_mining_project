best location by far staff was was amazing there were little treats left in your room like macaroons under a bell jar adorned with a peacock feather i would return just to stay at the hotel even if it were not in the center of all of the attractions we were greeted each morning by hester at breakfast with a cheerful hello we slept in and missed breakfast one morning she said no worries and magically brought us bowls of fruit yogurt and had the chef whip up our favorites she seemed to anticipate what you like before you even know what you want amazing service
