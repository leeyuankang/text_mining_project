i was truly impressed with the hotel and it is pure luxury if i was go to go back to amsterdam would rebook with no hesitation i loved as soon as you walked in the free treats and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful they went above and beyond as saturday evening wanted to hire a bike for hours and did not charge us the room was fabulous and loved the shower
