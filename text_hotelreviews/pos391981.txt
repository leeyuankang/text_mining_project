i have been in amsterdam man times and this hotel has the best location in the city beautiful entrance nice swimming pool and sauna facilities excellent for relaxing after a long work day or long traveling day excellent staff making sure to keep guests welcome in the hotel which is not so common in europe might be the best hotel in amsterdam
