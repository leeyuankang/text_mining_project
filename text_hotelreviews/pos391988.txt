excellent hotel and a very friendly and professional staff very impressed with all the little attentions to my years old daughter suggestions to print at the reception the tickets to the zoo so we don t have to queue etc etc the breakfast is excellent too with very big choices for every culture the room not very big but super comfortable the bed is amazing and the last floor very silent we ll be back without any doubt
