the hotel is in a great location if you want your base to be in the centre of the old town ideal if you plan to explore by foot rooms were clean and in a good state of repair to say you are in the centre of town a stones throw from the red light district it was also fairly quiet for sleeping it was my wife s birthday the day we arrived and a cake was brought to the room which was a nice touch it was good to have use of the pool spa
