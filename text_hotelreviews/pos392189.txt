i loved the view from the room and the facilities were very good you can stream from your phone to the tv there s a record player and some vinyl to listen to illy coffee pods and a machine are provided the general area is lovely very vibrant but not too hectic very easy to get to as there s a free ferry from central station the staff are great really helpful the rooms are interesting it s basically like being in a large poured concrete cage with floor to ceiling windows even in the shower the bed was comfortable i informed the staff we were on a trip to celebrate our anniversary and they covered the bed in plastic rose petals and wrote us a note which i thought was very sweet
