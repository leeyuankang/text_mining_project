the bed i don t remember the last time when i have slept so well it is literally a heaven bed the view from my window was definitely a bonus to the perfect bed the room ambiance would make you want to stay more plus you have amazing toiletries the shampoo shower gel etc made by one of the local brands the only thing hotel might want to reconsider it is their price when people ask to purchase those it is unbelievably high even for its quality
