i loved everything about this hotel we travelled to celebrate my daughter s birthday and the staff left a message on the mirror and left her a birthday card and some sweets which was a lovely touch i booked this hotel because of the music theme and this didn t disappoint the staff were lovely from start to finish we ordered room service from the butchershop late one night and the food came quickly and was delicious this is a funky cool hotel and as my daughter said its a hotel with personality we loved and would definitely go back if you are considering this hotel please book it immediately if only to see the amazing elevators thank you so much to everyone at sir a dam xxx
