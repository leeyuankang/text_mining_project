the full english breakfast at the butcher was the best breakfast we ve had since visiting amsterdam the bed was so comfy and all facilities were modern and clean the staff were so accommodating and as we were visiting for my boyfriend s birthday they put balloons and upgraded our room which was thoughtful the hotel is very secure and you needed an access key card to go to all of the rooms
