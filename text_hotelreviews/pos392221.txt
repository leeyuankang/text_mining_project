what a wonderful location with great views of the hustle and bustle just a leisurely ferry ride minutes across from central station we loved the entourage cool and contemporary with the most comfortable beds we slept in in a while the staff were very welcoming and my husband was very impressed with the gym they even offer group lessons and personal trainers we definitely reccomend staying here
