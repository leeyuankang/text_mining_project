the beds were comfy and was in a nice location for sights and walking to town the rooms were cleaned and fresh each day without fail we were able to upgrade with no issues which was lovely the room had a terrace but the electronic roof over it wouldn t work staff were friendly tooo i would stay again but would consider breakfast and room sizes first
