the breakfast was very good and you had many options love that the hotel also had a swimming pool so you could relax after a day in the city or at the beach before going out for dinner det rooms was grat as well overall a very good stay in barcelona only min with metro to catalunya the hotel had also a good ac and a fridg to cool down the drinks we bough would visit again
