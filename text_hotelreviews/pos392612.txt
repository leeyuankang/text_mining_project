excellently location right next to sala razzamatazz which was the focus of my trip served also by two adjacent metro stations marina bogatell which enable access to barcelona s extensive underground public travel network the rooms are spacious and modern in style open plan bathing facilities separate bath shower and lavatory possibly not for the shyer guests sharing a room but if you re totally comfortable with your partner it won t be a problem breakfast is buffet style with an excellent choice of fare you can also enjoy bucks fizz to start your day if that s your thing this is my stay in this hotel it won t be my last
