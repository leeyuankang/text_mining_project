the hotel is modern clean and well maintained the staff are friendly and welcoming and we were upgraded from a double room to a suite foc on arrival the breakfast spread is excellent frequently replenished and fresh fairly short walk to the bogatell metro station from which you can easily access the whole metro network with a few changes between lines
