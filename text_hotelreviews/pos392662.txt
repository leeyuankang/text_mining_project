we stayed for nights and we liked the price for value the design of the hotel as well as the pool facilities the breakfast was abundant and they had typical spanish food as well the connection to public transport is convenient and the room was clean every day the area is a bit industrial compared to the other touristic districts but you can get used to it and you ll probably not spend much time there anyway the district is very chilled and silent you mostly see locals which can be nice after getting out of the busy streets of the center there are taxis parking in front of the hotel all the time which is quite convenient
