breakfast was excellent great variety of food my partner loved the prosecco too the en suite was modern and roomy walk in shower was appreciated it was easy for two to get ready at the same time there was a modern feeling about the room and the air con was very efficient we found we could walk to the beach the ramblas and the sagrada in minutes but the metro station was also conveniently close by the pool area was clean and relaxing and we also enjoyed using our complimentary passes for the spa we were particularly warmly welcomed at reception when we arrived and this gave us a good feeling about the hotel we really liked the hotel and would go there in future
