everything was just perfect we had an early morning flight so we arrived earlier than the check in time but luckily they had a room ready so we could sleep a few hours before starting to explore barcelona the room and the bathroom was spacious modern and very clean the bed was super comfortable as well the location is also great bogatell metro station is just minutes walk away both nova icaria and bogatell beach can be reached with a minute walk
