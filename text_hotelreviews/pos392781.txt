not a central location however this didn t matter a minute walk to bus stop on the barcelona city bus tour and a minute walk to the beach very friendly and helpful staff an excellent buffet breakfast that served everything even a glass of cava if you wished lovely pool area with an outside bar lunch facility and sunbeds we were upgraded to a suite which had a separate lift ideal as the main lift was very busy lovely bathroom with sinks bath shower and a separate walk in shower and toilet very comfortable large king size bed and other than a saturday night was relatively quiet
