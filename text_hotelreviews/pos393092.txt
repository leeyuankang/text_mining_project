the location of the hotel was superb as it was about from the beach and from the tube station it was also a lovely quiet area to stay in the staff were friendly and helpful the only negative was that we had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival but received no response neither a taxi was booked as requested this paid off as taxis were cheaper called on the street than pre booked via the hotel but it was a bit stressful as we arrived in the evening overall i would recommend the hotel due to its location and cleanliness
