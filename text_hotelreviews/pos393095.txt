it wasn t mentioned anywhere that the spa facilities the reason we booked the hotel you were allowed to use for hour per stay each only to realise you need to buy a swim hat to go into the pool the toiletries in room were not replaced unless we asked the coffee and milk in the room was the same dont want to keep asking for things which in other hotels especially star not its normal procedure will never visit that hotel again this was our second time in that city
