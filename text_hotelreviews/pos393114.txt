the spa facilities were excellent the hammam and different showers were particularly enjoyable the hotel was fairly close to metro stations and and the renfe train goes straight to passeig de gracia which is on and means that it is easy to get to the hotel by inexpensive public transport the staff were friendly and accommodating
