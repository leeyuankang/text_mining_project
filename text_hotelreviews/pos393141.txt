this hotel has just decorated bright and chic location quite good mins walk to the olympique port the breakfast was excellent lot of choices if u want to use the spa u have to change at your room and dont forget the swimming cap they sell the cap its fine the sauna space of spa kind of small but any way it was nice as well
