i loved the spa facilities in the hotel we didn t like our initial room top floor as smelly and had a view of a wall the reception staff were really helpful and offered to show us an alternative room on the floor which was bigger and had a better view they were patient and welcoming the bar man told us about an residential area full of restaurants caf and shops called ramblas de problenou worth the visit
