we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel room it was clean and nice designed we asked the staff about hotel room with balcony and they booked this room for us in advance the only thing what we didn t like it was the wellness room not tidy and the whirpool didn t work but all hotel services were good and staff was friendly we can recommend this hotel
