breakfast was sumptuous and yummy and the hospitality of the hotel staff and reception staff were very satisfying and knowledgeable the rooms and bathrooms were spick and span except for the fact that the location was lil far from the centre but compromised with the metro stations at walkable distance overall enjoyed the stay
