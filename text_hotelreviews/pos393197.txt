we went for the motogp and i would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to the circuit or looking for a place close to the beach but away from the hussle and bustle of the main strip excellent value for money rooms very clean and tidy staff couldn t be more helpful and welcoming only a min walk from the beach and nord bus station anyone who says it s an hour walk to the beach either walks very slow or went the wrong way spa was lovely great place to relax after a long day at the circuit or site seeing plenty of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from close by already looking to rebook for next year
