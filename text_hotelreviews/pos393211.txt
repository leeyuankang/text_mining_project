it was a very well appointed hotel and everything was clean and spacious with beautiful marble floors the bar was welcoming and relaxing the tapas meal we had one evening was absolutely delicious the breakfast restaurant was brilliant and you had a vast array of foods to choose from english and mediterranean you were never rushed and could help yourself to seconds and refills as often as you liked before leaving for the day there were always staff on reception and they were very friendly and helpful and they spoke very good english which was great we didn t get the room we requested but were given an extra large one to make up for it the metro was a minute walk away and the taxis were on the corner just outside the hotel
