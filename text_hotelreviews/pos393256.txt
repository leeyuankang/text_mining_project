stayed here for four days with family couldn t fault anything staff spoke excellent english were very helpful nothing too much trouble the hotel is ideally situated mins walk from beach and harbour it was very clean and spacious the breakfast was excellent with lots of choices would most certainly go again don t take any notice of the bad reviews they must have been meaning a different hotel
