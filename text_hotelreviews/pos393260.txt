the area around the hotel is very rundown but up and coming new district but with metro stations a few minutes away this doesn t have to be a problem there is a good bar next to the hotel that opens in the evening the rambla de poble nou is a nice rambla to visit full of restaurants and cafes with terrace seating there is a supermarket just up the road to the right of the petrol station the spa area is nice enough everything works
