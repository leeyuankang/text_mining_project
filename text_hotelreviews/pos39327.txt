nice room in a very modern and visually pleasing hotel which seemed clean and in which the bed was very comfortable only the bathroom was really small but apart from that also that was perfectly fine very animated areas nearby with lots of bars and restaurants but within the hotel i didn t hear any of it bus and underground nearby
