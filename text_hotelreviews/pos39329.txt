the room executive family was very spacious modern and clean with plenty of space for the of us large bathroom with new towels provided daily on site restaurant which we wanted to try but we didn t arrive at the hotel until and we were advised it was too late to order as the kitchen closed as there is a turkish restaurant just next to the hotel which provided a lovely alternative as it was still very busy at that time of night the hotel is just a minute away from aldgate east tube station which makes it convenient to get to other places via the tube
