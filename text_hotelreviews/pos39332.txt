the air conditioner broke down on the first night and the temperature in the room was very high the hotel was unable to move us as the hotel was fully booked but they brought us a fan as well as an electric cooling device which brought some relief the next day we were given another bigger room with good air conditioning hotel staff were willing to help us move our stuff and we received an apology and complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience wow the room has everything it needs from a nespresso machine a fridge empty though to a safe the bed was comfy and the shower was very spacious
