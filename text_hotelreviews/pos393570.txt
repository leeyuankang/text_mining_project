close to the central station min walking and the city centre but at a quiet place the rooms are nice and very clean the bed truly comfortable expensive as all hotels of this kind in amsterdam the staff were very kind one thing i really loved was that at the reception you may order some food and hot drinks even late at night we arrived to the hotel at and were able to order a pizza and hot milk
