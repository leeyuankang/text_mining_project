although slightly outside the centre it is easily reached via a short tram journey the location seems a bit industrial at first but the location is worth a good exploration on foot towards the waterfront there s the old lloyd hotel a few other restaurants and a supermarket and a short walk gets you onto one of the old islands walk in the opposite directions and there are more exciting restaurants tram lines are nearby and allow access to both sides of the city centre the northern end at centraal station and the southern end at the museums and the large grachten
