i usually have a problem not sleeping on my own bed not only was this bed so comfortable that i didn t notice the difference from home but this room was without doubt the quietest hotel room i ve ever stayed in while it wasn t in a central location the tram stop was only mins walk away and only stops to centraal station the tram stop was also there giving you a direct line to the museums
