very clean hotel lovely rooms very quiet and spacious we were a family with children who shared the sofa bed and still enough room to move around only stops on tram to central tram stop only min walk from hotel easy walk to nice local restaurants breakfast was sufficient highly recommend the waffles make sure you grab the discount vouchers in reception for attractions they were handy we got a taxi from the airport to hotel but was quite expensive and we found the public transport so easy when we left we ended up catching the tram to central and train straight to airport and saved euro we would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again
