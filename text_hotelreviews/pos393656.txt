the breakfast was incredible and really relaxed a decent breakfast is the best way to set up your day when you re out and about and this didn t disappoint for variety or quantity even the coffee out of the machine was delicious getting around from the hotel was really easy as you could catch trams to centraal station or the leidseplein from away from the front door or you could walk anywhere if you prefer though it ll take minutes to get into town or leidseplein on foot the room was really well laid out the bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of plug sockets the wifi all over the hotel was strong and it didn t seem to drop out there was no issue leaving our bags on the final day so we could go off and explore without the annoyance of lugging our bags with us this was another free service and nice touch
