the included breakfast had a good selection to choose from except the scrambled eggs they were quite bland i like they had a sofabed so you fit three or four in a room and it was comfortable and the room size was decent the shower has a temperature control feature which is a nice touch having a bath is old fashioned in a modern hotel the staff were excellent caring for every need and generally happy and friendly the hampton is near a tram stop so the main part of the city is only a few stops away and only costs euros for unlimited travel on the trams for a day
