the rooms were clean the bathroom was clean the staff were friendly cheerful and helpful the bartender was knowledgeable with regards to the london drinks of which we were not aware of location near to both aldgate east and liverpool street station and bus stations in close proximity were extremely helpful for us to get by there were atm machines in close proximity the hotel was located on brick lane and we were able to visit the sunday upmarket and take in the local culture overall it was an excellent but too short of an experience
