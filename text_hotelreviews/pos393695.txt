i stayed here one night while in amsterdam for buisness i needed a hotel room in the area and picked this hotel based on ratings on trip advisor it fitted my needs perfectly i stayed in a standard room and was very happily surpriced to see i had been given a corner room with lots of light see pics am guessing there are only three or four of these rooms so it was a great luck however if you are a light sleeper the noice from the street and nearby railroad might disturb ypu a bit the room was clean and seemed newly renovated it had everything i needed including an easy to use alarm clock and several sockers for charging my electronic devices the bed was super comfy that i decided to stay in bed a bit longer in the morning and skip breakfast when checking out the nice receptionist offered me to have a coffe and something to go as i did not have time to sit down for breakfast i will make sure to return to this hotel when in this area of amsterdam next time
