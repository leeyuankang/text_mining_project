clean so thankful that i booked here last minute we were on a long vacation and i was confining reservations for another location after watching the reviews on that location i was scared i read the reviews here and felt better it is literally a minute walk to a tram station that can take you right back to central station within minutes so don t be concerned that you are out of the city center it was clean quiet larger rooms and a large breakfast
