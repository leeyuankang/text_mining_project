we liked everything about this hotel because we ve been traveling around different countries and different cities and stayed in so many different hotels so we have something to compare with we are nearly at the finish line of our jorney but so far it was the best hotel even though we booked at least hotels during our trip nothing would compare to this one very modern very clean and cosy i would definitely recommend price and quality is perfect
