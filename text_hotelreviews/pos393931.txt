iat the end of a danube river cruise my husband and i stayed in vienna for two extra days i wanted a hotel with local vintage charm and modern comfort on trip advisor i found a hotel review with the words my husband loved the smoked salmon at breakfast included well my husband loves smoked salmon too i booked it what a lovely hotel we had room gracious elegant spotlessly clean fantastic bed lavish breakfast in a lovely setting cold air conditioning opening casement windows behind thick velvet drapes view of the vienna theatre with its plaques honoring beethoven and many others elevator but also beautiful marble stairs leading down to the beautiful lounge and breakfast rooms hour coffee and tea with some pastries and fruit if you wished the location was also perfect blocks from the ring and right beside the naschmarkt where we browsed the food stands and ate two excellent open air dinners sadly we left on saturday and missed the weekly sunday house concert played by an ensemble in the lovely lounge turned out to be economical also as we could walk to everything my husband said i love this place
