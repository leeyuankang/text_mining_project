everything to like especially free sunday night chamber music concerts for guests fabulous breakfasts and a garden for enjoying it as well as indoor space we ve stayed there before the remodel which is terrific with each floor a different viennese theme we knew our room would be small but it still had a nice desk area and two lounge chairs huge window so good air flow though no view as we knew would be the case so no disappointment beautiful modern bathroom very well designed just a block from secession and entry to karlplatz underground transport area so you can walk all the way to the old town walk streets without having to cross any boulevards about yards to naschmarkt with every choice of food and wine and resturants you can imagine we will stay there again everyone is so friendly it s a great place
