it is at a very good location and right across the street there is the line underground station that takes you to all the great locations around barcelona you can also take the d bus to the barcelonate beach from about metres from the hotel mnac and other interesting places are within walking distance as well the staff were extremely helpful and the pool and the smallish jacuzzi on the floor were a great change from barcelona s heat at summer the bistro is a gem but has no visitors and it s a shame its course meal of the day is about and very good value for money and the bar is also nice breakfast offered a lot of choices and we were really pleased with it the room was comfortable but a bit smallish
