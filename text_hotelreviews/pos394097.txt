very nice room with spacious wardrobes cleanliness was excellent and the bed was soft and spacious we liked that we were given refreshments to use in the room e g shampoo etc did like that there was a fridge in the room but pricey for the items that were inside i think this would be used more if was cheaper cleaners were very friendly in the hallway passing
