i stay at this hotel on a fairly regular basis the staff are friendly and efficient and you are always greeted with a smile the rooms i have stayed in vary in size but the beds are super comfy this is one time when size doesn t matter there is everything you need in the room iron with ironing board kettle coffee machine hairdryer as well as toiletries in the bathroom plenty of electrical sockets for your gadgets too i don t always have breakfast when i stay there but there is a fabulous choice of both continental as well as cooked for me there s no other place i d rather stay when in london definitely highly recommended
