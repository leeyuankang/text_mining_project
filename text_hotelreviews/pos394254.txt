i took my nephew away for his birthday trying to be a good uncle and we needed a twin bed arrangement when we arrived it was a king queen not sure but i asked the desk to review my request and she said no problem we will correct it very nice at front desk came back after some coffee and they gave us the same room with the king bed a roll away bed cot next to the closet which now we could t open went down to front desk and then they apologized and said they would will fix it i asked can we just get another room they said no rooms available not sure about that anyway they put twin beds in the same room took out the king bed and left the cot so now we have twin beds pushed together and a cot i asked can we have this cot removed we need to get into the closet also need the beds to be separated okay we will be right there they said from down at the front desk very pleasant i explained to the maids that came that we will not be sleeping together during the trip so the beds need to be separated which my nephew and i already were doing her response was get this lol oh now don t fight your trip just started when she left my nephew said i think she thinks all in all the rooms are nice and the hotel great location was perfect i recommend the trip if you can afford the larger room go for that and enjoy
