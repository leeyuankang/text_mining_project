we stayed at the grosvenor house hotel as a large group as we were getting married in mayfair library on december the hotel was everything we dreamed of and more even though the hotel had been undergoing major renovations and was being put back to normal when we arrived the staff made everything perfect our rooms weren t ready when we arrived but the staff looked after us and arranged for us to have drinks and to relax while we waited as a goodwill gesture javier gave us free wifi for our entire stay as well as one day free parking due to having to wait around half an hour we had our grandaughters with us and the staff sent a baby pack to the room for the youngest which included toiletries etc on the day of our wedding i was treat like a celebrity by the staff we wanted somewhere to have a drink with guests and the staff arranged that as well as sending chocolate covered strawberries to our room with a congratulations message with them the final touch was a beautiful bouquet of flowers from the hotel as we were checking out thankyou to the staff of the hotel for a wonderful stay
