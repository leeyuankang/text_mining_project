the room had a beautiful view and the balcony was a nice bonus we loved viewing the city at night from our balcony we were upgraded to a suite which was a wonderful surprise we were greeted by a very nice employee at the front desk when we arrived and the bellman was very thorough in his descriptions in our room there english was perfect which made it easy
