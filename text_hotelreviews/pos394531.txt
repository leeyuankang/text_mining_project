we loved the rain shower and the extremely comfortable mattresses we had an amazing view from our park side balcony overall the room was spacious comfortable and very clean which is what counts most in our opinion location was convenient less than a ten minutes walk from wien mitte walking distance from the inner city public transportation nearby we didn t have breakfast at the hotel we visited ringstrasse coffee houses instead so i can t really comment on the food but the in house restaurant where the buffet is served looked very fancy from what we could see
