we found this hotel to be excellent the exterior of the hotel may not be eye catching but once you are inside it is a totally different story hotel lobby is quite modern inviting and fresh as it is obvious that the hotel was recently renovated hotel location is very good with the aldgate east tube station district line less than minutes walking and liverpool st station about minutes walk away start of brick lane is also less than minutes walking tower of london and thames river is about minutes walking from the hotel hotel room is very spacious with ample space for people and their luggage we booked an executive family room the couch and the two armchairs were also a nice touch the size and the overall ambiance of the room was very good and it definitely made for a very comfortable stay the bathroom was also very spacious and the lighting in it was fine provision of tea herbal teas nesspresso coffee pods yes there s a nesspresso machine in the room and biscuits was also nice touch a jug of water was also provided which we thought was very nice especially after a long day venturing into the big city of london the main bed was very comfortable while the second bed which seemed to be a sofa bed got mixed reviews from the kids the room has its own air condition system and this came handy because although the temperatures were not very high during our stay it still felt sufficiently humid to warrant its use we used the hotel restaurant a couple of times and if you receive discount vouchers from the hotel staff i would recommend to give it a try the food was very good and with the vouchers is on par cost wise with restaurants around the area serving cosmopolitan dishes western european food view from the hotel restaurant was not anything to write home about but don t let that deter you from giving it a try
