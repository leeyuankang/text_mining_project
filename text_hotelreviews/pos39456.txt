we stayed here in july hotel outside was not all that impressive but don t let the exterior look deter you once through the front door the hotel is superb the room was incredible super modern interior spotlessly clean and very well presented a service and staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble location was terrific value for money close to local restaurants and supermarkets minutes walk to london tower minutes walk to aldgate tube station a fantastic stay
