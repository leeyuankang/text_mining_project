this hotel exceeded my expectations because from the outside the hotel looks like a dull office building once inside i realized it is a charming boutique hotel with generously sized rooms featuring all the amenities one could expect the views are stunning and my associate had a corner room that had a huge balcony overlooking the entire city with a gorgeous panorama the staff were friendly and very responsive to any and all requests
