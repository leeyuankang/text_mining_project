private balcony air conditioning quiet room located right on the schubert ring for easy access to everything extra touches like chocolates on the pillow and a room safe hairdryer eco friendly toiletries the hotel staff were exceptionally friendly especially sabrina k who gave me great advice on where i could go and how i would get there normally the single traveler is given the less desirable rooms in this case i feel like i was given the perfect room with an incredible view from my balcony to enjoy the evening after an enjoyable day of sightseeing
