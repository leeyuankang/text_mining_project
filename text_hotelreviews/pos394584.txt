hotel is on the top floors and we had wonderful top floor room with a balcony that wrapped around so we could see east out over the parkstadt as well as south and west back toward the city having the view of the park was very calming and open the only downside to the top floor was when it rained we had to take our umbrella out to have a smoke on the terrace the floor balconies do not have as great a view but do have a bit of cover the staff were wonderful the room was clean the bed was comfortable and there was a lot of closet storage space we skipped the euro breakfast at the hotel restaurant to try local options nearby several within a minute walk there is a ringstrasse tram stop right outside the hotel and the metro stop is very close by the city center itself is within walking distance
