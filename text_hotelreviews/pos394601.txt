the hotel is accross the street from stadt park which was a plus because we were traveling with our dogs it is also close the the subway station it is a minute walk to the opera house the suite was on the floor and had a wrap around deck which gave us amazing views of the city the bed was comfortable the resturant was also on the same floor which was nice wifi was strong breakfast was good please note that they cook eggs to order so you will not see them on the bufett this was a huge plus you can get fried soft boiled scrambled or an omlett
