the hotel is in a great place to see the centre of vienna the room i had single was very well equipped and clean the only issue i had was that the shower drain was blocked so when i had a shower it spilt onto the floor of the bathroom however the staff were very apologetic and when i returned in the evening it had been sorted without a fuss
