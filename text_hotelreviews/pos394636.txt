we stay in the hotel for the second time because it is centrally but peacefully located hotel occupies upper floors of high office building thanks to it the rooms have great panoramic views over vienna and no noise from transport opera st stephen belvedere are nearby wonderful breakfast with champaigne and same great view after you stay in this hotel there is no desire to try any other hotel in vienna
