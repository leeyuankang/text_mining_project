one of the best hotels i ve had the pleasure to stay in was a little on the pricey side but hey that s london staff were very friendly and even upgraded us upon our arrival they were also very helpful in giving recommendations and directions rooms were impeccably clean and our bathroom in the family room was huge and amazing complete with basins perfect for my mum sister and i the hotel made our stay in london so much more enjoyable very close to aldgate east tube station with great stores all around yet in a relatively quiet area tower bridge walking distance there is also an amazing sandwich place cafe just next to the hotel run by a moroccan family would recommend there for breakfast as i heard the breakfast at the hotel is rather pricey would definitely come back again
