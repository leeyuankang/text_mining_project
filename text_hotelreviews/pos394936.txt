lovely and central location near the big bus stop that shows you vienna in less than half a day good for business people too who have little time to do much sightseeing all the staff is extremely friendly with the exception of the manager of the cascade bar who was quiet disappointing for an establishment like this there s a daily happy hour between and and the attitude the man had when asked if i could take my drinks to the room was just not right food is lovely and so are the cocktails i stayed in the superior junior suite and the room is spacious with lovely views comfortable bed seating area and two big flat screens but the channels connection and scrolling through the tv menue wasn t smooth maybe the remote control was old and the channels weren t showing well the choice of channels is quite limited with many german speaking channels and not enough of the main english or french channels rooms are clean and room service is quick and very professional food is up to standard they know how to prepare your steak exactly between medium and well done keep it warm bringing it to the room and make sure it s tastes like as if it comes straight from the stove topped with a lovely b arnaise sauce
