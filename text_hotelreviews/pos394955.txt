the staff at this hotel are amazing when we checked in we realized that there had been an error in the request for double beds they immediately fixed the issue and found us rooms that were close together then on the last night of our trip i misplaced my purse and they helped to locate it pick it up and ship it to me the next day i cannot say enough of how great their customer service is at this hotel a
