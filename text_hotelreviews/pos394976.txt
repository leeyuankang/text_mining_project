the location is perfect close to everything in the center ring yet just across the street from a lovely park the rooms are spacious and the beds very comfortable we also appreciated the kettle in the room for making tea the breakfast was wonderful and in a pretty dining room at all levels the staff was exceptionally attentive and friendly
