service was friendly and efficient food was plentiful good variety and very fresh we had buffet breakfast buffet dinner during our stay unfortunately we did not get much time to use the lounge however when we did we noticed there was only one young women dealing on her own and it was very busy but i must say she handled herself very well and was still very friendly and helpful she was a credit to your company we would definitely stay again thank you we actually own a restaurant so know all about service etc so tend to be a little more critical but we had no complaints cheers
