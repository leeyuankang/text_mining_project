the hotel is well appointed with a modern low key boutique vibe which was what we were looking for the staff is very attentive and helpful and nice touches such as champagne in the lobby the hotel is in a perfect location to enjoy the port beach and easy access to major city destinations i will definitely stay here in for my next bcn trip
