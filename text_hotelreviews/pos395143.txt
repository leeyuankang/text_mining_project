the room was a lovely cool haven when the heat outside had reached heights of up to the room had everything we wanted and needed including a view of the port although we were on the floor so didn t get to see a lot of the port the trip was for my wife s birthday and i d asked for some champagne to be in the room when we arrived it was really easy to communicate with them beforehand to arrange and they d added some extra chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate cake along with a note to say happy birthday when we arrived in the room we also received a little note from the cleaner wishing my wife a happy birthday as shemust have noted the birthday from the cards we put up the rooftop bar was incredible especially for the san juan celebrations on the june the bar stayed open after hours and we had the perfect spot to have a glass of wine and watch the fireworks although we did get bitten a few times after sitting up there for a little while overall it was a lovely stay and i d definitely recommend to friends and family
