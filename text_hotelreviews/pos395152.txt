our rooms were amazing with a juliet balcony and beautiful views over the port we loved the layout of the room and the shower which was pure luxury it was great to have a nespresso machine which was replenished every day as was the bottled water the breakfast had a good buffet variety and they also take your order for a cooked breakfast the hotel is clean fresh and smart looking and in a great location for the beach restaurants nightlife transport and much more wonderful roof top terrace with a plunge pool but we didn t have enough time in our itinerary to spend as much time up there as we hoped every single member of staff we dealt with was brilliant in every way and always had a lovely smile
