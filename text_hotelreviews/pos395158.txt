the room was great very clean and the bathroom was new the room had a nice small balcony you could see the harbour and boots the personal was very friendly and the bar at the rooftop was inviting the so called fitness room has only ergo meter and one treat mil so nothing for people who want to do some sports overall i would definitely book this hotel again also the inner city and shops are only minutes away
