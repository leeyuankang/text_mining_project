the hotel was very nice the staf was nice too but they had forgot to clean my room they had done the bed nice so i did not notice before late when i was going to bed that the room was not cleand up the sheets were not changed from the last person and when i went to the bathroom there was still a used toothbruch and used body shampoo and other stuff in the shower it looked like the cleaner had not been informed that the room had a new guest its a shame because the hotel was actualy nice and otherwise clean the food was also good
