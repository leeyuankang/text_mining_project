great experience the hotel was located right on the marina we enjoyed views of the yachts and boats from our small balcony the room was very clean and orderly the staff was very friendly and made some excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants and finally we loved the small rooftop it had a small pool and lounge chairs we used them to enjoy the wonderful barcelona sun
