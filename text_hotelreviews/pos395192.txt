we enjoyed the hole experience from when we entered the hotel to when we left staff great clean and very tidy and location was great we did not eat there for breakfast or dinner as there are some great bar s cafes just outside where you can sit outside and people watch the one thing about this hotel was one reason for booking it is that it has a roof terrace with plunge pool and bar which turned out to be a disaster as most of our stay it was closed to general guest s as the management had let it out to company hospitality booking s gave us the impression that the normal guest mean s nothing to
