location was perfect close to the beach maremagnum shops loads of restaurants and hop on hop off bus a minute walk from the busy las ramblas and close to the gothic quarter the hotel was spotless and the view from the roof terrace was amazing lovely cocktails on the terrace which also has a small pool staff very helpful each room has a coffee machine but since we are not coffee drinkers they happily provided us with a kettle for tea breakfast a little expensive but well worth it
