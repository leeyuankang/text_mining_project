i think this is a fantastic hotel we had a nice designed room with a great view of the harbour the location is perfect with top class tapas bars and restaurants just around the corner the breakfast is definitely among the best ever nothing was missing so i can strongly recommend this hotel if you re looking for the best in barcelona
