the room is very clean and has great facilities there is a heater in the bathroom which is very useful to dry the used towels and hand washed clothes the location is very convenient just a few minutes walk from the exit of aldgate east underground station a walk distance to liverpool street and brick lane market the staff are very nice and helpful speedy check in and check out we requested to change a room with a view and the staff made the change on the same floor for us she just asked us to stay outside the room to wait for her to come upstairs to give the new room key cards to us and didn t have to go downstairs to the reception with our luggages to change the room
