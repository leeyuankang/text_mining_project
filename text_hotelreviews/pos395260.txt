the hotel is beautifully decorated and in a great location right near the port barceloneta el born and the barri gotic my plane had been delayed so i arrived later than planned the reception staff were so friendly gave me a glass of cava and still allowed me a complimentary cocktail despite it being after the time for this i was made to feel very welcome and i would recommend this hotel to everyone who fancies treating themselves to a great weekend in the fantastic city
