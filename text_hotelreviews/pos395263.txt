convenient location cava offered during check in very good breakfast loved the rooftop lounge staff is very helpful we booked an economy room which basically had enough space for a queen size bed but it still had a large screen tv small desk and mini bar and full size bathroom with breakfast included it was a great price especially since we did not plan to spend much time in the room other than sleeping
