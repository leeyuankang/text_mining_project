very well situated modern boutique hotel in port vell and within walking distance of all the fish restaurants in that area rooms bright and very quiet but maybe this was because we overlooked a courtyard the breakfast was great and nothing was too much trouble we received a wonderful welcome from reception when we arrived and were delighted with every single member of the staff they were all very polite and helpful
