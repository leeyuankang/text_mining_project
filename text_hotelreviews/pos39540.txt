the cleanliness loved it a lot the room was extraordinary much better looking that in the picture the staff really went an extra mile for me because i arrived earlier than the check in time and they managed to accomodate my needs even though it was early the room was incredibly clean and very very cosy i would recommend this hotel to everyone
