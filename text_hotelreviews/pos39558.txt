great room size for central london lots of space for families if you book the executive family suite this hotel is newly renovated it is wonderful we appreciated the tea coffee and cookies after traveling all day staff were super helpful with recommendations on where to eat and shop make sure you visit the spitafields market food heaven also ask for a room on a higher floor looking out to the city the view of the city lights is lovely
