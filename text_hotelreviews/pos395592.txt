excellent hotel in a great location would highly recommend it to anyone within walking distance to lots of bars restaurants and easy access to metro and bus stops to get to the sights slightly further away staff very friendly nothing was too much to ask hotel is a in a lovely area much nicer restaurants near the hotel than in las ramblas where you pay for the location and poorer quality food easy to walk to this area if you wish would recommend visiting la bouqeria market in las ramblas got a taxi to the airport which costs around euros and takes about minutes well worth it roof top bar quite expensive as expected but lovely views rooftop pool is an added bonus to the hotel we didn t have breakfast in the hotel so can t comment on that but loads of restaurants cafes close by to grab breakfast would definitely stay in this hotel again if we came back to barcelona
