the lady who checked us in was lovely friendly and efficient she gave us a couple of nice restaurant names and helpful reviews on tourist spots nice and well maintained hotel in a great locality taxis were available in front all the time close to casa mila and casa batillo quality of breakfast was very good though options were limited you have to walk out of the hotel and go next door for breakfast
