our greeting by the reception staff was warm and friendly very welcoming the decor is fabulous and fresh with bright colours and great lines and textures throughout our breakfast service was also wonderful our server seated us a few minutes before the close of the buffet was extremely attentive to us and our young son and was very willing and helpful when we requested something to take upstairs for our teen daughter he even walked us to the elevator also the manager stopped by our table and chatted with us about our trip and shared his stories about a recent visit to our home it was a fantastic experience and i will return
