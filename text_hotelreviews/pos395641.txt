great feel to the hotel very luxurious and all staff were very attentive the rooms are pure luxury and the roof bar is the ideal place to have pre dinner drinks didn t actually eat there so unable to comment on food the location of the hotel couldn t be better situated among the top designer shops and iwithin walking distance of the gaudi building and the cathedral familia
