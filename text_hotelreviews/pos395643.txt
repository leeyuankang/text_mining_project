super super good location located in the middle of shopping area next to all kinds of shops like la perla rolex feels very safe walking around at night in this area for barcelona not far from good restaurants really convenient very nice room designs spacious comfortable and clean helpful staff great wifi except one small thing that caused slight inconvenience the fridge in the room basically worked as a vending machine meaning you cannot open it but can only select what drinks you want from the screen and they come down so we bought some yogurt packs from the corner shop and couldnt store them in the fridge and had to finish them in the evening after dinner which was slightly annoying but otherwise this hotel was perfect for barcelona
