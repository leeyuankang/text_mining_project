great location to start blocks from la pedrera and walking distance to many other things had a view of it from our window otherwise a taxi ride to most places was wonderful helpful staff prior to traveling emailed for some itinerary help and they responded immediately and helped us organize the days we were going to be there to see as much as possible room was a good size comfy bed and quiet
