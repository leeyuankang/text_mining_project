the location of this hotel is fantastic right beside the aldgate east station albeit it was closed days of our visit but liverpool street station is just minute walk away and there are so many buses close by the room was fabulous really modern and clean the shower was amazing staff were really accommodating too no problem leaving our bags with them when we arrived early for check in and again after we checked out
