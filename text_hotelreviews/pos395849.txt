our night stay at monument hotel raised the bar we ve always used to measure star accommodations to a much higher level we have never felt more pampered nor have we ever received the incredible level of personalized service that we received at monument from any other luxury hotel establishment it was a major highlight of our trip and we would recommend this hotel to any traveler business or personal who expects just a bit more from their hotel experience the very worst you can do is to be satisfied and these days receiving even basic service is becoming rare enough
