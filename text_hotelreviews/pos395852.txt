it s a really good hotel great location for shopping and visiting casa milan casa batllo the room is really clean and comfortable i really like the design of the room they use jo malone as the washing tools which is one of my favourite brand and they have the valmont spa which is also attractive to me the smell around the hotel is element even though the price is a little bit high it definitively worth it for one of the stars hotels in barcelona it is the best hotel i ve stayed this time besides the tall guy in front door who helps us to take the luggages is really nice and helpful i was great experience here and i definitively will choose this hotel for my next barcelona trip
