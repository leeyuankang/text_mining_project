we liked the style of the hotel very much our room junior suite was very very nice and also the bathroom with the cool bathtub we enjoyed our weekend without the kids although we think kids are welcome spain in general for us for this kind of category of hotel is also important the smell very pleasant smell at the entrance and of the rest of the hotel too wifi top connection everywhere location very good if you want to go for shopping a lot of shops around the hotel area just perfect staff super friendly
