there is so much to like about this property the location is excellent and the perfect base from which to explore the city the hotel itself is stunning we booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a suite on arrival which was a nice touch the room itself was beautiful and the bathroom was a real highlight especially the free standing bath and very large monsoon shower much bigger than the pictures would suggest the bed was very comfortable and the turn down service at night was a superb extra touch particularly liked the food and drinks all free in the room except for alcohol which were topped up daily and the jo malone toiletries were incredible sounds odd but the hotel is scented beautifully around the corridors and lobby which oozes a luxury feel every time you walk in
