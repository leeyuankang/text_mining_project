rain shower and bathroom specifically were awesome free non alcoholic drinks from the minibar were a nice touch they had a pillow menu staff was unusually attentive to the point of remembering our names days after we checked in pretty sure they also mailed some postcards for us without charging us for postage this was my favorite hotel on our trip
