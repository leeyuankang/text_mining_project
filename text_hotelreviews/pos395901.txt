i loved that there s a rain shower and hot bath also that the toiletries are jo malone one of my favourite the other thing is the fact that you can choose your pillow and the non alcoholic beverages in the mini bar are complimentary which was a very nice touch the breakfast is not a buffet but was very nice and at reception she was very good and helpful in sorting out my reservations
