staff were absolutely incredible not one bad word to say every single one of them went above and beyond for each one of us and made us feel very welcome and comfortable we were a group of girls years old we weren t sure about the location after reading some of the reviews but we did not have any issues local restaurants were thriving over the weekend aldgate east tube station across the road mins from shoreditch which is a great night out a easy commute into central mins at the most direct tubes to and from victoria coach station which was great for us brick lane minute walk up the road actually on the same street definitely worth a visit on a sunday the hotel was comfortable clean and very relaxing highly recommended for any occasion
