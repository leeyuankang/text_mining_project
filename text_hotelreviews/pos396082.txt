i cannot praise the staff enough at this hotel they were incredibly helpful and friendly right down to the chef bringing around warm fresh crossaints to guests during breakfast the bed was very comfy the hot water actually stayed hot and we had a lovely view of the sea from our room window the gym was quite well equipped and i was lucky enough to have it all to myself one morning the lounge and pool area was a lovely place to catch some sunshine
