good location and brilliant breakfast however it s a struggle with the lift in the hotel it takes a awful long time to use it sometimes you have to wait for several minutes i used the stairs instead pool area is great with very friendly personal the old chef in the restaurant is great and they really did the best to make a nice breakfast for you overall a very good hotel supermarket close as well min walk to the beach gym is quite good as well i do train a lot so i was surprised a lot of hotel usually have no equipment and if that s the case i do not stay there
