we stayed at the hotel as it was close to parc del forum for primavera festival the cost was quite high which i imagine was due to the location at the time of the festival but it was within walking distance from parc del forum and the beach was a minute walk lots of little restaurants nearby in poblonou and the bus was and took you all the way to the centre near la ramblas and the gothic quarter the rooftop pool and lounge area was perfect and although you had to pay to hire the loungers and beds which we felt was overpriced especially for guests already paying to stay there was plenty of space to lie on bean bags or ground area to lay your towel the rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel was very clean staff were very attentive and we had a free bottle of cava as we were visiting for our honeymoon overall a lovely stay and although very expensive it was in the perfect location for the festival
