the location is nice it is on the front sea line but actually you have still to come over a few roads and a few sidewalks to get to a beach approx you can get a walk to a bus station and get to the city center in minutes the restaraunt and breakfast itself is nice also you have a nespresso machine in the room with free capsules every day room cleaning works well
