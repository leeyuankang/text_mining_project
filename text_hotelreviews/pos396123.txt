the bed was super comfy and the staff very friendly it was our honey moon so the staff gave us a bottle of cava which was really nice the location is pretty far from the main part of the city though which was unfortunate but overall it was a nice stay the rooftop pool area is great but the price to rent a sunbed is extortionate also the coffee served is from a nespresso machine i would have thought that would be included given the pods are on y pence each and we were charged euros a coffee
