the location is fantastic right on the beach and very central to the port and city centre the room and bathroom we had was large and the beds were so comfortable our room was spotless very nice views of the beach across the road the atmosphere in the hotel is really nice taxi bay right outside the hotel is brilliant there is also a lovely restaurant next door to the hotel the hotel restaurant opens until which is handy if your on a late flight
