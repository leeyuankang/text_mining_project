we got upgraded to the deluxe room and although the room was a little bit on the small size we put this down to the fact the bed was absolutely massive and soso comfy the rooftop terrace area with the bar and infinity pool are what made it for us very friendly staff burger at the rooftop bar was the best burger i have ever had
