we loved everything the staff are amazing so helpful and cheerful rooms are great good size very clean variety of stock in mini bar and very comfortable the bar area situated on the pool deck has such a relaxed vibe and the staff are a dab hand at making cocktails the staff are so attentive and bend over backwards if you fancy splashing out you can hire a private cabana where you have your own vip are
