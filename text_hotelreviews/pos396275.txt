i liked the fact that it was so near the beach i like the selection at breakfast but would have liked there to be more of the basics of an english breakfast as well eg fried eggs beans the staff especially reception staff were very helpful and gave good directions to the main transport for tourist attractions i like the provision of complimentary biscuits and tea the beds were very comfortable the room was nice and had a good view
