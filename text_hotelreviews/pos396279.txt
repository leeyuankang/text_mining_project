very nice place we enjoyed the gym and the spa jacuzzi and sauna a lot after having walked for hours in barcelona it is not very close to the center but in the end it was even better less crowded calmer the poblenou rambla is very close and it is better than the rambla in the center at least you can have a walk without slaloming among people we tried the hotel restaurant once and it was quite good and not too expensive people are nice the bedrooms are comfortable clean and well equipped we are happy about our holidays
