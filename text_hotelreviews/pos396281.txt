this was our second visit to this hotel as we were really impressed with it the first time round some may find its too far away from central but we love walking along the beach each day into the city centre amazing views of the sea from our room breakfast really great and such a variety they upgraded us on arrival and facilitated an early check in for us bedroom was beautiful very clean
