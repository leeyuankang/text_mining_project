the location near the beach lovely to be a couple of minutes from the beach where there are numerous nice bars and restaurants and many people running and working out as well as relaxing if you don t mind walking you can get to all the touristy places from here barri gotic la rambla etc are minutes walk along the beach front if you have a decent pace promenade quite deserted at night though so we got taxis back in the evening morning nice staff helpful and welcoming decent size room and clean bath and shower would happily stay here again if i could get the same discounted price again
