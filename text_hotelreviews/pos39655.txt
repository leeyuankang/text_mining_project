the room was newly renovated and very nice the staff was very good note although it s hard to find the door the hotel is under renovation inside everything is very new and shiny the breakfast is very good and good value for the price the hotel is also closer to the underground than it looks it s only about meters away from the whitechapel gallery outlet of the aldgate east subway
