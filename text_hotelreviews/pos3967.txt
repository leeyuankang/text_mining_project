this is a grande olde dame of a hotel very charming right opposite russell square it is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome i stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet i quite liked that fact and i have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but i did not find fault and i stayed in a small double everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot tv had plenty channels housekeeping was very good i have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired a brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by maintainance unlike a previous hotel du vin that i stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything all the staff from the doormen conci rge to reception were very nice and helpful to me sometimes i think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet george the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay good olde grande dame lovely staff will benefit from her renovation within
