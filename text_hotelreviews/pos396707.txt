the hotel was exremely quiet and i appreciated it very much as i had a tough day and needed rest the bed was comfortable room and bathroom were spacious enough the staff very friendly and helpful bar by the pool has a great view the breakfast buffet offered quite a broad range of food including fresh fruit milkshakes which i thought was great will definitely return
