this is more of a nice boutiquehotel which also fitted our little family me my wife and a year old little boy we really appreciated the nice lobby the food was outstanding in the restaurant and the little pool worked well for us however for older kids it might be a little boring on the other hand there were only some meters to the nice beach with a small taverna
