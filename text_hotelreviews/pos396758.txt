we chose the hotel for an overnight stop after hiring a car from the airport it s easy to find and the parking is in the basement of the hotel the hotel is modern with a rooftop pool and bar the mare gin tonics were fantastic there is a shopping mall opposite and it s a short walk to the nearest metro stop which is on the yellow line for easy reach of the city centre
