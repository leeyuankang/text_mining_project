i thought the hotel was very clean and beautiful the lobby is outstanding and has a great aroma i considered asking what scent was used a few of the staff working the check in counter were very friendly and always had a smile others were not as friendly i was assigned to the wrong bedroom but when i notified the staff i was upgraded to an ocean view free of charge that is excellent customer service
