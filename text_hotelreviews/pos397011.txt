we stayed here for two days and loved it charming boutique hotel with the best rooftop bar in town location right by the beach walkable to many good bars restaurants etc service housekeeping good we had a prompt check in they even gave us early check in and were helpful with information etc they charge euros per hour for a late checkout room not so big but okay for a couple we tried the classic room on floor but the patio which is actually just a french window opens towards the veranda on the inside of the building so can be a little dark we then stayed on the floor in a classic room with a patio which was much nicer as it was a little bigger with a small patio you could actually open and step out a bit on the patio if you want it s very small but still a patio lots of light much better than the inside open window as this patio opened towards the side street can be a little noisy as there are bars on the side street but we didn t mind it that much we didn t eat at the hotel but we tried the rooftop bar and it was great the rooftop bar is perfect for a sunny drink and some snacks we actually enjoyed the rooftop bar the most definitely recommend this hotel to anybody exploring barcelona while staying by the water
