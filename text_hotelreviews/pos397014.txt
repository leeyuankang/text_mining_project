we were offered a glass of cava on arrival and had a bottle waiting in our room i had emailed and let them know i was celebrating a birthday anniversary which was a nice touch the room was a good size with a large bathroom with bath and shower our room had a balcony looking straight across to the harbour worth the money a night just for that tbh close to la rambles and an amazing tapas restaurant called sensi must visit do not hesitate to stay here you wont regret it
