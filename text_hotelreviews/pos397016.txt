the hotel was very well located with easy access to various subway stations though if you are traveling with a small child in a baby stroller sometimes the location of the elevator may not be obvious within walking distance to la boqueria market and pretty much to most of the gaudi attractions assuming you are ok with walking km there is a self service laundry nearby as well the hotel is near les rambles and we felt safe walking with small children there even at night though of course this is really subjective the hotel staff was always very kind and friendly one of the managers would always come to give a high five to my son and talk to him making him feel very special the room was spacious and within our expectations we stayed in the renewed section of the hotel our room was in the second floor facing the street but in spite of that the room was very quiet there is a bar on the top floor with a great view of the pier overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again
