don t miss staying here superior service and staff the hotel is beautiful it was a small palace and those details are evident downstairs the rooms have been completely redone recently and resemble the simplicity of the seasons breakfast selection was excellent with eggs made to order after a long trip from san francisco and a five hour delay i was greeted with champagne and an upgraded room since they could not get me into a room before pm that afternoon this hotel would be a wonderful day base from which to explore barcelona it s in near the historic district with a harbor view so you have everything close by thank you staff for a wonderful but too short stay
