we booked the serras because of the excellent ratings on trip advisor and we were not disappointed luxuriously appointed rooms professional friendly staff and plenty of them and a convenient central location this is the perfect boutique hotel we booked a junior suite as we were traveling with a teenager and it worked out great a compact room but well thought out so we all had our own space and felt pampered we didn t dine in the restaurant but ate breakfast here every morning which was a lovely leisurely start to the day we especially enjoyed the roof terrace with its imaginatively prepared cocktails and delicious small plates i would have no hesitation in recommending the serras
