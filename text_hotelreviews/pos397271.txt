the hotel is on the farthest south end of gothic quarter very easy to re locate after wandering all day morever the location is on a major street with lanes of traffic and our room faced the street yet we never heard a sound sound proof windows were amazing nearly all taxi drivers knew the hotel just by us saying serras that was very nice
