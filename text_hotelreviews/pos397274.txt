the hotel was in a great location staff very accommodating and helpful beautiful roof top with music friday and saturday nights must sit up there and have a picture of sangria and enjoy the view i rented a scooter for the days i was there and was a great option got to see everything the hotel staff is very good always putting fresh towels and tidying up when we would leave would definitely recommend
