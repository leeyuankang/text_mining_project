the staff were extremely friendly and helpful the hotel is lovely with a roof top terrace and pool and as it is january we were supplied with blankets and fire effect heaters when sitting on the terrace every evening the bed was extremely comfortable and everything in the hotel was spotlessly clean and tasteful the location is perfect for exploring barcelona and i would highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious stay in a beautiful city
