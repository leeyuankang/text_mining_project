we stayed here for our honeymoon for nights the location was incredible in the gothic quarter and yet only a minute walk to the beach we were greeted with glasses of cava which were refilled often and an introduction to the hotel and the nearby area attractions the manager as well as the front desk staff we waited too long to do this review and have forgotten the names were so friendly and helped us to find great places to eat and explore as well as making reservations for us the room was beautiful spacious and very modern when we arrived in the room there was an arrangement of chocolate chorizo and cava as well as some beautiful flowers there is a wonderful rooftop terrace with a bar and a small pool with views overlooking the marina and the gothic quarter really nice to spend some time up here they also have a really cool bar and library on the first floor as well as a michelin star restaurant when we come back to barcelona we look forward to staying here again
