great location in front of the harbour and a short walk from the beaches the historical areas and the ramblas for the nightlife all staff were fabulous from the moment they helped us with our luggage from the taxi and gave us a glass of ice cold bubbly as we sat at the reception desk to the moment we left everywhere was spotlessly clean rooms equipped to highest standard from nespresso machine to the fabulous huge walk in power shower attention to detail second to none will stay at this hotel again at the first chance we get definitely could see how being a small boutique hotel competing with better know chains of hotels made them go the extra mile
