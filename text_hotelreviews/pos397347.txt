from the moment we walked into the hotel we received a very warm welcome and the staff continued to be amazing throughout our trip the rooms were stunning exceptionally clean with the most comfortable beds the terrace was a lovely area to relax and have drinks after a busy day of touring around the city sights location was also in very close proximity to major sights las ramblas strip and shopping streets
