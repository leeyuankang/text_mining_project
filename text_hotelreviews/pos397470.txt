spacious hotelroom should be said i had a corne room which is a little bigger then the some of the other rooms quirky with the bathtub in the middle of the room but that just gave the room some charm and personality in my opinion nice little french balcony where you could stand and watch the citylife pass by staff where friendly and accomodating but best of all where locaition locaition locaition right in the heart of the city with two of the major metro line stops yellow and purple line within meters distance making access to the rest of barcelona fast and easy would be happy to use this hotel again if i needed to stay in barcelona another time
