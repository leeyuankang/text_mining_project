great location it is in one of the main shopping areas in barcelona and near the train station direct to the airport the d cor of the hotel is quite funky and nice it is close to the main tourist attractions and about minutes walk from the beach there are also loads of restaurants to eat near by so if you do not fancy a big buffet breakfast or pay euros for it you can go out and eat in any of the places around there are cheap and the food is great we spent about euros for two people depending on what you order
