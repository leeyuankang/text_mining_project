from the moment we arrived at the hotel until the moment we left a week later we just loved it it is the most beautiful building in a prime location and the interior is stunning our room was beautifully comfortable and all the staff from the staff who serviced the room to the reception staff and pr staff were exceptional we would particularly commend alexandria and luria for ensuring that we went to the best places to eat we met the deputy general manager who was utterly charming and helpful ensuring that we could check out in the afternoon and take a shower since our flight was not until the evening all in all we shall definitely return and do not say that about many places it was a treat
