excellent first impression for barcelona my husband and i shared a room with my dad and it was comfortable for three people we had a welcome champagne in our room location was perfect five minutes from metro and the room was modern free coffee tea and biscuits during the day and a free happy hour at great location extremely friendly and bilingual staff we didn t eat breakfast in the hotel as we wanted to experience different places we had issues with the wifi in the room and they immediately provided us with a hotspot to use during our visit for free this was awesome since we didn t have a sim card and could use wifi all through the city we stored our luggage after check out and they let us continue using the hotspot until we had to leave for the airport we would totally stay here again great service
