this is a fantastic hotel location is perfect close to everything including gaudi properties just up the road we were upgraded to a junior suite with a lovely outdoor area for sun bathing and just sitting with a glass of wine this had protected views over the street but still was not noisy we left the window open all night the bed was enormous with beautiful linen fresh pillowcases everyday great breakfast only friendly efficient staff can t fault it at all helped make a great stay in barcelona
