we had an absolutely amazing experience at sixtytwo hotel this was our first trip to barcelona and the location couldn t be more perfect the amenities at the hotel are excellent everything was modern clean and comfortable but the best thing about the hotel was the staff and particularly laura she did a wonderful job helping us figure out where to start our tour of barcelona helped us buy tickets to a few attractions and even gave us a portable wi fi device for free next time we are in barcelona we are staying here again
