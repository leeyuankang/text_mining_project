very nice modern hotel quite glamorous it s somewhere you could see james bond staying beside that i actually don t think i ve ever had better service at a hotel which is number one for me and my family we had our month old boy with us and when we entered our suite we were pleasantly surprised to see a cot already set up with a cuddly toy within it the complimentary tea juice fruit and baked goods was a nice touch as well available all day and evening the staff here were absolutely incredible can t say it enough we ordered room service and they ran out of ice cream one of the staff actually went to the shops to get ice cream even though i told him there was no need above and beyond to top the experience off the location is perfect with everything at your doorstep you certainly will enjoy your stay here
