location of the hotel was great away from the most touristy part but within walking distance to the shopping area and gaudi buildings the subway was also at the door step for those who would like to venture further away front desk staff was very patient and helpful especially laura we had a junior suite and the space planning and design made the room bigger than actual measurement the terrace that is part of the room was great to chill out very cosy room overall with different light setting options will definitely recommend accommodation to others
