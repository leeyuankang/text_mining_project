i loved that they had cold champagne and assorted types of cheese meat and crackers in our junior suite the day we arrived which was the day of our anniversary the room and bathroom are very modern and clean the location of the hotel is at the heart of a major shopping street where you can find well known brands we found this ramein restaurant that is around the corner of the hotel it is by far one of the best dinning we ve had in barcelona the hotel is also near two of gaudi s creation which were beautiful and magnificent fyi restaurants don t open until so be sure to have a late lunch
