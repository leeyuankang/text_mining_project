when looking for grand old world charm this is your pick fantastic staff whose personal pro active approach and attention to detail made our stay a very enjoyable one the rooftop bar is a cool place to have a few sundowners on the terrace or at the pool whilst enjoying a splendid view of the city the room was exactly what one would expect from a hotel such as this one so don t expect iphone docs multiple tv screens or high tech infotainment systems but a high quality spacious clean and very comfortable room also the location is great to explore the city or to go shopping
