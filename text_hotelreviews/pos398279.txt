we stayed across the street from the hotel in a condo it felt very safe well appointed and spacious having two bedrooms and two bathrooms was great for a family of four after a long day of site seeing it was nice to have some room to spread out we had a patio as well which was great for having a glass of wine before heading out to dinner overall a wonderful experience
