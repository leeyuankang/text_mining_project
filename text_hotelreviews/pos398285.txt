we stayed in an apartment across the road from the hotel the apartment was beautiful spacious and clean the kitchen was large and well equipped including a washer and dryer too we had two bedrooms and two bathrooms which were really nice staff very friendly and helpful and all areas of the hotel were clean and luxurious the hotel is in the perfect spot if you want to do the open top tour bus as both routes stop close to the hotel city tour
