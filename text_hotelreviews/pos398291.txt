we loved the location charm and staff at this hotel and were also pleasantly surprised that we had been upgraded to the penthouse upon arrival we had booked a suite but the room that we were given was beyond wonderful hot tub on the balcony overlooking paseo de grasieg too lazy to check spelling chilled champagne and snacks waiting for us truly a wonderful experience for our first visit to this amazing city i was also presented with a beautiful parting gift of a candle upon checking out just great customer service and attention to detail all around we had booked this hotel as a prelude to a day cruise and loved it so much that we plan on visiting barcelona again one day and will definitely choose the hotel majestic when we do
