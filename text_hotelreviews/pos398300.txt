first night awake all night due to position of room next to service lift deliveries and laundry being wheeled around then banging into lift next day after complaining they gave us a room on a difference floor but in the same area so was moved again to another room which was ok but the whole sleepless night and room changing spoilt our much looking forward to weekend
