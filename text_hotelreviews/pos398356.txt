impressive interieur in a central location at the heart of barcelona in short distance to all the important sites with everything a world leading hotel should offer most remarkable was the friendliness helpfulness and professionalism of all staff from doormen to reception to housekeeping to bar service junior to senior it was really great we especially loved the roof top terrace bar with an amazing food and drinks selection and beautiful artisan look and delicious taste the view all over the city especially at sunset is most beautiful we definitively will come back
