after staying in a extremely small hotel in paris and the tiny cabin on our cruise ship this hotel was like an oasis we got to the hotel early directly from our cruise ship and our room was already ready the room was very large and modern great amenities like the espresso maker cold air conditioning and the bathroom was a good size breakfast was superb and highly recommended the location was central and only a few steps away to the get on off bus shopping and restaurants the concierge was very helpful and hooked us up with tickets to a great flamenco show overall a great experience
