the rooms are very nice and comfortable the aircon was working properly we got an upgrade which made everything better we were also able to leave our luggages when we checked out before our flight wonderfully located between casa mila and casa battlo at the paseo de gracia which is a shopping avenue very clean and peaceful lovely to walk at night breakfast selection is also good
