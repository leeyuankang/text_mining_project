convienent location on the picadilly line gives you direct access to heathrow coventry garden and leicester square just a few blocks from the british museum we had booked a superior room but were informed prior to arrival that due to renovations it would not be available provided us with a rebate for downgrading to a standard room and gave us free breakfast the room we got was much bigger than we expected which was a pleasant surprise the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay the breakfast was great although i don t know if i would spend the per person if it was not included
