roof top bar was wonderful with beautiful view of the city locations was excellent for a winter city break in barcelona and if your fit you can walk virtually anywhere in the city to lots of lovely local restaurants and markets great links to the metro as well though if your feeling a bit lazy lol i love this city and visited time last year it has something for everyone o
