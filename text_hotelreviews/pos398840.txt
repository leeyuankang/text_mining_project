the wifi was appallingly slow in the room and non existent on the roof top bar the bathroom in our superior room was tiny and very poorly designed with few toiletries one shampoo that doubled as shower gel no conditioner no bathrobes and the basin was in the corridor outside the bathroom so no possibility of any privacy and no space around it for two people s toiletries the shower was in the same tiny space as the loo so we swapped rooms with my daughter whose standard room had a better bathroom but was a smaller size with a smaller bed for two people sharing the superior room the bathroom is a joke not a funny one breakfast was chaotic with the main coffee machine broken throughout our four night stay a tiny kettle provided to boil water for tea but it was the slowest you could ever imagine and also tiny so one was constantly looking for staff to ask for more water not enough teapots ever large cups ran out no plain yoghurt on two days the most popular so there were always spare fruit ones that no one seemed to want choice of food was good though some cakes and pastries tasted of chemicals and were clearly not home made very dry and tasteless red velvet cake check out was problematic summary brilliant location clean hotel nice staff but terrible bathrooms and chaos at breakfast needs a shake up in management at breakfast which incidentally was not included in the price and charges hefty euros per person if booked for the duration of your stay at check in otherwise i think it was euros per person and a rethink about everything to do with the bathrooms which were just dismal
