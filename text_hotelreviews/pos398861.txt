rooms were clean comfortable and spacious air conditioned but not noisy and is the first hotel i have stayed in where the room temperature was spot on quiet for a central location too arnold who met us on arrival was very welcoming and helpful the highlight is the rooftop bar we didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that
