i came to the hotel as it was recommended by someone who lives in barcelona it s central with great access to the metro stations i was with my year old son as we were over to watch the barcelona game for his birthday staff were so helpful and really tried to give me and my son the best advise to enjoy our stay from a great hotdog restaurant for a quick bite before the game to advise on metro lines and the most economical ticket to buy couldn t have been more helpful and i would definitely stay here again xx
