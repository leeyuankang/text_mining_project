the location is excellent the superior double room very comfortable i really appreciated the powered window shades and every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful they seem to love their jobs the breakfast is wonderful with many selections if you re planning on a full day of touring i highly recommend starting with the hotel s breakfast
