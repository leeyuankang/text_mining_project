hotel royal passeig de gracia is well located sagrada famalia and ramblas are walkable distance the metro is in the next block if one does not like to walk varying degrees of shops and good restaurants are all over the place finally the hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating i hope to bring my family to barcelona and we definitely will be staying here
