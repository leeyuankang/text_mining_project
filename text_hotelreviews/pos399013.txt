the staff were all friendly and exceptionally helpful it is rare to get such amazing service as we were given they all deserve a massive pay rise special mention though for clara a receptionist par excellence who went above and beyond the call of duty when we arrived at the hotel early in the morning several hours before we were originally due well done
