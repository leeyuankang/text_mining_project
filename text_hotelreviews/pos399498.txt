i liked the quirkiness of a small boutique hotel every single one of staff is very very friendly and several that are very very hard working some worked harder than others of course one guy was the doorman the luggage guy the pool guy and when he wasn t busy doing that he was polishing windows sweeping etc all with a smile on his face in a black tie no less in the hot sun the rooftop bar pool was great rooms were clean upon arrival and the hotel was very well located central to everything
