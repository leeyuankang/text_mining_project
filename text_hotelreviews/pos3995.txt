my daughter and i came down to visit soas and were looking forward to staying in style we loved the space in the room the armchairs that the windows opened onto the park having an actual bath in the bathroom having real glasses rather than plastic cups the beds were comfortable and cosy we could leave our suitcases with concierge and generally we loved everything about the russell hotel
