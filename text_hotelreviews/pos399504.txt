my daughter and i stayed here for nights and though the room was smaller than anticipated despite being an executive room and them not fulfilling our wish for a corner room it was at the end of the hallway room and therefore very quiet floor carpeting though somewhat old fashioned certainly helps keep the noise level down the ac is very efficient and runs very quietly so our nightly sleep was wonderful the beds are on the softer side which is to our liking so that was good we checked in and our room fridge was not working after different attempts over days the fridge was replaced we asked for an iron and board and this was delivered immediately and left with us for the whole trip which was great the breakfast room while small is good and the breakfast very extensive especially for spanish standards our bathroom was renovated and modern but not clean hair in the tub on the first day afterwards not a problem anymore though and everything was replaced daily as needed towels paper etc rooftop terrace is lovely but as it s small and narrow it gets very crowded very quickly and unfortunately non hotel guests are allowed there too so there isn t room for paying guests pity the staff everywhere is very helpful and friendly the location is perfect for walking to the gothic quarter el born la rambla etc where there are tons of bars restaurants and eclectic shops and beaches harbor but a bit of a schlepp to the metro the bus stop and the hop on hop off bus is right outside the door if you choose that traveling method all in all a clean modern hotel on the inside in a beautiful old style spanish building with friendly staff and good breakfast would definitely come back
