the hotel is located about min walking away from pla a catalunya where the aero bus stops you can get there by metro in min but the closest metro station is jerume or arc de triumph which is almost walking minute away the location of the hotel is awesome surrounded by tapas bars and restaurants the best fish restaurant pradetta is just behind the hotel la rambla is to min by foot away the famous aquarium port the same everything is in walking distance and you don t need taxi or bus the hotel itself has a skybar with a mini swimming pool and resting area i guess very helpful on warm summer days the rooms are small but very clean and mattress is too soft for me the room has a safe and boiler the bathroom was big compared to the room with a nice italian shower a hair dryer is provided in the bathroom breakfast for was worth it but it s nothing overwhelming by the way a ride from airport by taxi costs and can last from to minutes we had dinner at mini bar on floor and the quality of the food was good the staff is multilingual and also very helpful if you don t mind the small rooms and the soft mattress then this hotel is probably the best value you can get in barcelona
