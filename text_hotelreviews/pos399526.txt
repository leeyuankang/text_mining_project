the staff were really friendly and accommodating the rooms were clean beds were comfy and the hotel was very well located with many bars and restaurants next to the hotel and a beautiful park opposite it was easy to walk to most places but there was also a metro a short walk away and it was very easy to catch a cab from right outside the hotel entrance the roof terrace bar was very impressive
