clean nice and super safe hotel with really professional and helpful staff in great location in barcelona within walking distance to the gothic old town and the beach but in a slightly quieter neighborhood i loved everything about this hotel my friend had her purse pick pocketed in a nightclub one of the nights and the hotel staff was really helpful in trying to help her contact the nightclub to see if they had found it my room was relatively small but had a nice comfy bed good standard and comfort in general and was very clean an oasis to come back to after a day or night out in barcelona
