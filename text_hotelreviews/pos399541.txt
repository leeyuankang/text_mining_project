everything about this hotel was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful the entire hotel was spotlessly clean and the terrace areas allowed us to make the most of the lovely weather when we needed a break from strolling around barcelona the breakfasts were excellent plenty of choice and all well cooked the bed was really comfortable and the hotel environment was quiet and restful
