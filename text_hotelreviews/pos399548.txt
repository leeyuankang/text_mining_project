the hotel is in a great location being near to several metro stations once you get your bearings sorted you will find that you can actually just walk to the different attractions we seldom used the train during our days and even chose to walk back to the hotel from the city are at night the room was nice and quite it was facing the street but there was no noise i believe we were given an upgrade by the check in staff thank you he also briefed us on places in a local map and recommended some places to go he was very helpful overall i would stay in the hotel again and i will recommend to friends
