first things first the room was just amazing not too small not huge but just the right size well decorated practical and as clean as it gets also it s been a while since i slept in such comfy bed it was like being hugged i had forgotten what it was like to have a perfect night s sleep the hotel is located in a very quiet albeit central area and we didn t hear any noise coming from other rooms surprinsingly the internet conexion was great the bathroom was pretty awesome as well let s just say that there was a tub and the floor was warm which i found was a nice touch like a cherry on the top of a sundae the friendliness of the staff is another point worth mentioning the airline company had lost our luggage and they went above and beyond what was required to try and help us to wrap it up we couldn t have asked for a better hotel at such a good price i d stay there again in a minute
