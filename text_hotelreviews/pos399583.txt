wonderful hotel with very friendly and helpful personnel great location beautiful rooms and good breakfast even though it is quite big the personnel managed to make our stay personal they booked all the entrance tickets we needed and printed them for us so no hassle at all for us outside the fun starts around the corner with bars and restaurants everywhere it is only a minute walk to the cathedral and this walk will take you through a lively and colorful neighbourhood also the hop on hop off bus stops right in front of the hotel
