the location of this hotel is fantastic mins walk to the hip bars and food of the le born area perfect for a more relaxed visit to barcelona it s not as central for public transport as some other places but all of the gothic quarter is walkable even in the heat of summer and there is a public bus right outside that stops a block away from the sagrada familia the rooftop pool was lovely breakfast was excellent and all the staff were warm and friendly all in all good value for the quality of the hotel and the service we received we would definitely stay here on a return visit to barcelona
