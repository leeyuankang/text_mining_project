an excellent hotel we both loved our stay at k k picasso it was a last minute booking made after i had arrived in barcelona the beds were super comfy the bathrooms very nice and the whole hotel had a wonderful ambiance the rooftop and pool area is lovely with great views over parc de la ciutadella it was also very quiet at night so we slept very well and the location is perfect
