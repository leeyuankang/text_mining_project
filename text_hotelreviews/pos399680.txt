the location is excellent the hotel also has very quiet rooms if you don t mind not having an interesting view can walk to a large number of restaurants within minutes of the hotel through the pedestrian strrets of the gothic quarter the staff were always friendly and not simply polite the breakfast spread was excellent there is no shortage of hotels in this area but we would definitely stay here again out of choice
