the pool was lovely and great restaurants and shopping just across the road so you can eat out at different places or breakfast over there if you don t want to pay a day the pool is owned by a different company but f you are a hotel guest you can have one of the e beds but remember you can swim and sit on the sofas if you don t want to pay that each day
