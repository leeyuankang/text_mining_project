typical hilton hotel business oriented with good service and good choices for breakfast very convenient location if you want to use the excellent sandy beach which is within walking distance there is a huge shopping centre bang opposite the hotel and a metro station on the other side of the shopping centre with fast connections into the centre there is a taxi stand just outside the hotel and a trip to the centre is about euros both hop on hop off tours have stops outside the hotel
