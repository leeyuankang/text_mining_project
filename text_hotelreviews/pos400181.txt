the breakfast was excellent and i particularly liked the smoked salmon and dill mayonnaise the staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for me i like the fact that i can open the windows in my room access from the airport is easy and the d tram to the centre is great i like the liechtenstein palace next door
