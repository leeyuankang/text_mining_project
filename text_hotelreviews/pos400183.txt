strudlhof hotel is a very good solution for a weekend or more in vienna a hotel without cheap impressions but professionalism is what you will get clean rooms every day rich breakfast likable lobby not exactly at the city center but close to it stands in a very quite place the most quiet i have ever stayed on my travels distances form st stepehn s cathedral or hofburg palace and musems quorter is about light walking friendly personel completes the whole picture distance for those who do not like walking is the only disadvantage it will be my first choice for a future journey in vienna
