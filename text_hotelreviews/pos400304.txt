the room was gorgeous and the bed and pillows made it hard to get out of every day the rooftop bar has an amazing view and we went up every night for the sunset the staff was extremely friendly and gave us recommendations daily they were spot on for their resteraunt suggestions we didn t use the pool but it looked very inviting
