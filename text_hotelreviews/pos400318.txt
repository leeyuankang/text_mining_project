the room was a good size for europe they had a really good coffee maker in the room bathroom was awesome and they even came by with water and chocolate at night the rooms have good art in them as well we enjoyed the rooftop restaurant they had a very good breakfast the staff was very professional and friendly they speak english the location of the hotel is two blocks from the passeig de gracia which keeps things quiet
