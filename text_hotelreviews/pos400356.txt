we loved everything about the claris from the complimentary upgrade to a fab suite to the welcoming glass of champagne and then the lovely bottle of wine in our room the room was so comfortable and clean the products in the bathroom were amazing every member of the staff were friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs and nothing was any bother even when we went across the road for a coffee while waiting for our airport transfer the doorman came over himself to let us know it had arrived and not to worry he would load our cases and call us when it was time to go while it was too early in the year for sunbathing the roof top terrace is really lovely and affords great views of the city we will definitely be back and would recommend the claris to anyone travelling to barcelona
