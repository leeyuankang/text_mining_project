loved the location and friendliness of all the staff they gave us some great tips on places to eat the welcome glasses of cava when booking in and the nespresso machine and bottle of rioja in the room where nice touches ideally situated for the best shopping areas felt very spoilt to be staying in such a lovely room and hotel we ve stayed in a number of barcelona hotels including more expensive ones we didn t feel uncomfortable venturing out at night which can sometimes be the case in some areas of barcelona this is by far the best we ve stayed in and we would happily return
