great location very close to two of gaudi s best creations the hotel itself was very plush and staff very curteous there was a mistake with our room and we were taken to a much more luxurious suite they then transferred us to our room when they realised this wasn t a big deal for me but the hotel staff gave us a tasty fruit plate and an apology note for this mishap very generous really appreciated the concierge advice on vegan restaurants and also for good spots to go to at night overall very very satisfied
