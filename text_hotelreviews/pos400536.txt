we were warmly welcomed to the hotel and every encounter we had with the staff was top drawer all suggestions given at the front desk were right on a special shout out to noah on the friont desk who was helpful knowledgeable and personable and made our stay superb the hotel s location is wonderfully close to the casa mills and the casa batll the outside patio was a wonderful surprise it was a bit pricy but we thought it was worth every penny if we ever go to barcelona again we would stay here
