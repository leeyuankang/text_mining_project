i love this hotel upon check in the staff immediately greets you with a welcome glass of champagne and also gives you an overview of the city with recommendations on restaurants and attractions the rooms are great and pretty spacious the style is transitional modern and contemporary but still the character of an older building we were celebrating a special occasion so they gave us a bottle of champagne and chocholates in the room a great treat i really enjoyed the area of town as well it s not far from luxury shopping or the city centre and in walking distance to most local attractions the beach was under a euro cab ride i definitely will be staying at this hotel when i come back to barcelona
