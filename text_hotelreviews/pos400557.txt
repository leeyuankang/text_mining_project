the service was excellent the staff was truly wonderful i had emailed ahead with a special request a piece of birthday cake for my husband we arrived and we re not only greeted in our room with a cake but he received a thoughtful handwritten birthday card to top it off as a gift the hotel added a bottle of champagne also the hotel is in a perfect location near everything basically the rooms are wonderfully designed the bed super comfortable no expense was spared here
