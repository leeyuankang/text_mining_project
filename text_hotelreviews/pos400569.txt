having opened the day before our arrival we were unsure of what to expect at casa mimosa and we were not disappointed the staff were efficient and friendly and their aim was to ensure the comfort of all guests our favourite place was the outdoor courtyard area a popular area to enjoy the delicious breakfast included during our stay a bonus was the view of la pedrera s spectacular rooftop by day and night thank you casa mimosa
