the hotel was lovely the pool was great to relax after sight seeing and our year old loved it there was a bar selling drinks and snacks and a shaded chill out area i would highly recommend this hotel as great location to get about the city staff very friendly we had a triple room and room was spacious with very comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom with bath and separate shower
