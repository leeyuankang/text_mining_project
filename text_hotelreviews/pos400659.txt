room was generous size even for a family of fantastic bathroom shower area with modern finishings just one block from plaza de catalunya tons of restaurants nearby the room itself was quiet the staff was extremely helpful while the pool was smaller than expected it was still nice to have a pool to cool off in after a long day of sightseeing i would definitely stay here again
