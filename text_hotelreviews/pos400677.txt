the hotel is in an excellent location in central barcelona and within walking distance to most of the sights the side streets near the hotel are filled with little cafes a number of which we patronized our room which was in the rear of the hotel looked out on a pedestrian street so we didn t have any noise the staff were very pleasant and accommodating we stayed nights and could have stayed longer because the hotel is comfortable
