the bed was huge and very comfortable in general the room was gorgeous and super clean the terrace is fabulous it has a pool with sun loungers a bar which serves food also and bigger wicker chairs which you can lie on the staff were very friendly and very helpful the hotel is in a central location within walking distance of passaig de garcia train station which made it easy to get to from the airport we also travelled outside the city and this made that possible all in all we would definitely stay here again when we revisit barcelona
