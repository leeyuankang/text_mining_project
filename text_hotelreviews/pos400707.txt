fabulous location very comfortable bed essential after all the walking shower bathroom fantastic can t comment on food as we didn t eat in the hotel and we didn t use the spa or gym but everything was clean and staff very friendly even though hotel is in the centre of the city very quiet in our room wasn t disturbed by the outside world
