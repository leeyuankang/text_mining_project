the staff was exceptional and very friendly they made every effort to assure that my room arrangements were comfortable enough to sleep people by upgrading us to a suite at no additional charge we forgot that the hotel only accepts euro and not usa currency for payments they waited patiently while my husband went to the exchange window to convert dollars while we waited a lovely gentleman brought us expresso and tea while we relaxed in the comfortable lounge area the suite was nicely appointed and the best surprise was the private pool accessible from each bedroom prime location just minutes from las ramblas by foot
