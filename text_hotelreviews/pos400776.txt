the location of the hotel is great it is very close to las ramblas about mins walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants and shops around the bed was a nice size big and comfortable the shower is bigger than my walk in closet i m not even joking the staff at at reception were all very enthusiastic and helpful they have someone posted at the entrance at all times to call a taxi for hotel guest they halted a taxi for us at a m so we could catch our early morning flight i also enjoyed the bar and lounge areas all very nice
