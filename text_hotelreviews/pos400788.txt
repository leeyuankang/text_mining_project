the staff were very helpful and willing to go out of their way to make sure i was happy after a lot of confusion with my airbnb i quickly needed a place to stay for the night that was close to where i was already the booking process was simple enough but i guess i was a few minutes too late as a large number of families checked in just before me andrea at the desk was very apologetic and made my check in very quick and simple if it wasn t for her and ronel going out of their way i would still have been very flustered would definitely recommend this hotel and i would come back again for the location and the top service
