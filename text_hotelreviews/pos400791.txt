this is a great hotel right in the centre of barcelona the staff there are lovely very friendly and helpful the pool area is a good size lots of beds to lie on around the pool and also in the outside bar area both in the shade and the sun loved the covered outside eating area which sprayed cooling mist at intervals there is also a spa which looked lovely but we didn t have the time to make use of it lots of seating areas dotted around the hotel too we had a problem with a leaky shower which was fixed immediately so no complaints there the marble flooring throughout made the interior lovely and cool all the time there was lots of choice at breakfast and dinner in the pelai restaurant was fabulous we would definitely come back
