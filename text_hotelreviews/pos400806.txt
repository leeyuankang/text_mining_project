we loved this hotel the facilities were great the staff and the service were excellent and the location was fantastic we didn t eat at the the hotel so can t speak for the food but everything else was top notch we had booked a family room but when we checked in there wasn t one available we were given rooms instead which was a real bonus for us as we were travelling with teenagers it couldn t have been better
