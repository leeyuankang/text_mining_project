what can i say this hotel was amazing the staff were the most helpful i have ever come across they went out of their way to accommodate our every needs we arrived early in the morning from a cruise ship and were checked in straight to our room we had a late flight out and for a small fee we were able to check out at the room was great big clean and modern fab facilities and a great location my kids also loved the free wifi would definitely recommend this hotel
