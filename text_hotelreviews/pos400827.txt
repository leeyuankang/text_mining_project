all the staff were superb nothing was too much trouble always friendly and helpful this was our first trip to barcelona and their advice on public transport places to visit and safety was a great help hotel was clean our triple room was exceptional and far better than other family rooms we have used in other hotels with a king sized bed and double sofa bed ideally located for the ramblas district shops metro and buses
