we were extremely impressed with the hotel it was a lot bigger than we expected and the decor is very modern we were welcomed instantly at check in by a very friendly member of staff we were given complimentary drinks and also upgraded to a superior room at no extra cost our superior double room was very spacious and the bed was massive and very comfy the location is perfect right of the ramblas and easy to get to all areas with the metro at the end of the street we would definately stay here again on our next trip to barcelona
