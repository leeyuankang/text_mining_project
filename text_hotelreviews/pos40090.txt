loved the location a quick stroll down to the seine and cathedral notre dame great little restaurants and shops all around the area our personal favorite le dante the pool was small but perfect basically an oversized jacuzzi in the basement with the prettiest architectural brick work it also had a steam room and shower down stairs we had the pool area to ourselves the front desk was always very helpful and spoke english too when we needed transportation they d call taxi service and taxi service arrived very quickly minutes tops
