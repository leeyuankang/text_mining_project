the location was superb it is a minute walk to the pantheon the notre dame and the seine the staff were really friendly and the room was always clean the cleaner even tidied my shoes into a neat line when we came back after our day out the free bottles of water everyday were a nice touch and definitely needed i liked that the hotel was set back from the road and so it was quiet would definitely return
