i liked the location alot very easy to get around and all the main shops within walking distance only around the corner from la rambla which is very lively and alot of restaurants catering for many cuisines metros are nearby the hotel was very clean and the room was a good standard with a mini balcony although we were overlooking the main street there was minimal noise heard from the inside of the room as they had two sets of doors out onto the balcony
