the location is perfect and despite being right in the centre of barcelona the room was incredibly quiet we had a suite which was perfect especially as we were travelling with our month old baby she had her own room the lounge the terrace meant we could relax outside while she napped i m not sure there is much difference between the suite and the jonior suite seems we had slightly different terrace furniture and that was about it
