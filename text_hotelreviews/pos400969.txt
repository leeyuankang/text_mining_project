the hotel has an excellent location very close to all forms of public transport and a taxi rank it is within minutes of the ramblas with all its restaurants shops and open air markets we were very luck to be able to stay in one of the hotels suites with our own private plunge pool which was a very welcome relief after a full day sightseeing we will definitely be returning to the catalonia and would thoroughly recommend to all other travellers
