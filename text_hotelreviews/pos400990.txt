everything about this hotel was excellent its proximity to the square and ramblas was a huge bonus minute walk staff facilities were lovely best of all was the breakfast everything you could want to eat was there fresh fruit eggs cooked to order cereals yoghurt and sweet pastries galore all served til too our room was very quiet with two double glazed doors and two balconies with views over the laneway behind room serviced twice a day and fresh towels provided for the pool i honestly can t fault the place and will recommend it to anyone who will listen
