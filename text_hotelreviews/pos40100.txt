great location just off boulevard saint germain and close to metro market just around the corner and amazing restaurants in the area the swimming pool is fantastic after a long day of walking and exploring nearby attractions like notre dame and the louvre staff was really helpful and accommodated early check in and the breakfast was top class would highly recommend this hotel
