very central just a short walk from notre dame and close to maubert mutualite metro stop pool and steam room small but great hotel right next to a bit of an ugly police station and down some ugly steps hotel was certainly not as fancy and upmarket as the photos looked disappointing if you are expecting a fancy boutique hotel also starting to get a wee bit old but for people for a few nights in central paris the price wold be good just don t expect an upmarket boutique hotel
