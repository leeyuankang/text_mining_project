the staff all seemed to know us and were exceptionally friendly and helpful the rooms were beautifully designed although typically small and lacking sufficient storage space for a stay more than a couple of days the rooms seemed recently remodeled with the greatest taste shown in design details and gave an overall sense of harmony and comfort location just off st germaine convenient to metro a farmers market a sunday flea market at the end of the block restaurants everywhere and dozens of bakeries to pick up your fresh croissants in the morning a police station in the same block which gave a nice sense of security we will definitely return
