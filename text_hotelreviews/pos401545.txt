the blinds are really good despite there being a bright lamp outside when closed the room feels like a crypt a very good thing for me i like to sleep in any time of a day perfectly located we didn t take the metro a single time any tourist point of interest in the city is within a walking distance the staff did come only when we left as we did indicate by the door sign and didn t disturb our late sleep
