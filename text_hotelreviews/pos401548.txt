i absolutely loved the location and i appreciated the small boutique size of this hotel it was spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed with white and gold trim we both found our room to be extremely quiet as we could never hear people coming or going in the hallways the staff was friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a wave or a cheery hola whenever we left or returned we would happily recommend this hotel to others and would consider returning ourselves if we go to barcelona again it was close to absolutely everything we wanted to do and so handy to every type of transportation including the hop on hop off bus the julia tours office as well as the subway and the bus system
