breakfast eggs are real eggs and nutella is real nutella nothing more to say big variety of food everything fresh replenished all the time by the nice breakfast lady breakfast is served from until which is amazing and quite a long period you can come to the breakfast room any time of the day for free tea or coffee room we had a renovated modern room however the hotel itself is not that modern but very nice vibe interesting art everywhere in the room there is a free safe hair dryer and shower goods also mini fridge for you to use bed is rather hard which i like location the hotel is located on the corner of two streets with quite a traffic especially during the day so do not expect completely quiet nights unless your room faces the backyard where you can by the way sit the room is not completely sound proof but i am a silent freak so guess it would be absolutely okay for normal people my company slept well i used earplugs as usual so if you can request backyard room hotel is just a few minutes from westbahn station and next to the top of the biggest shopping street mariahilferstrasse running down to the city center reception all the receptionists were extremely polite and helpful but we did not need much though you can store your luggage for free in the hotel on your check out day reception runs hours overall very nice stay in vienna absolutely great value for what we got cannot fault it
