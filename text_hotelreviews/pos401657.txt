right next to the train station so in easy reach of public transport easy to find decent breakfast esp the freshly made waffles were a hit we were lucky to have a corner bedroom which was huge the bathroom was tiny but perfectly serviceable all receptionists and breakfast ladies were very kind and helpful but i would like to make a shout out to the half italian receptionist was extremely friendly and especially helpful in locating a restaurant for tango dancing
