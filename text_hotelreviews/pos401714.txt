the hotel gives you the feel of being lord and lady of the manor this is a very special place so english and its not often you get the feeling that all the staff treat it as home and take extra care with the details if you want run of the mill square box boring hotel this is not for you but if you want romance history sumptuous furnishings and a feeling that you have been transported to another era but with all the modern convenience then this is perfect this hotel is one of the very few i have been in where i felt i had an experience not just a stay
