staying here is like a time travel the hotel has an amazing unique charm beautifully decorated and very nice location the staff is helpful i stayed in a single room with a bath tube i requested it the room is quite spacious much larger and comfortable than other places i have stayed the bath tube was beatiful and i loved it but might be a least preferred option for people who prefer to shower
