a once again excellent stay at the rookery it s a beautiful property in the heart of clerkenwell a particularly interesting and untouristy part of central london just adjacent to the city staff are super friendly professional and conscientious in spite of the nearby club life i find it to be a quiet and restful aerie from the hubbub of london breakfast is not included though there is food available to order to your room or the charming lounge but this is not an issue for me especially with so many excellent food choices nearby
