the hotel location is excellent and the building is stunning inside and out the staff were accommodating and very pleasant as always the breakfast special offer was also a good bonus plus the fact we could leave our luggage with the concierge as our room wasn t ready and we didn t return until was a real comfort it was lovely to be able to sit in the bar with a glass of wine and unwind after a very hectic day
