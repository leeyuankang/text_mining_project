interesting area lots of places to eat not chains very close underground line property has a lot of charm we loved the simon mitchell room with the peaked ceiling no elevator so flights of stairs made for unexpected exercise staff is friendly and helpful pocket garden is lovely space ren amenities are great the breakfast just didn t appeal to us this time although it is very good and fresh four choices and can be served in your room or downstairs in the lounge or the garden but it is very easy to get food elsewhere
