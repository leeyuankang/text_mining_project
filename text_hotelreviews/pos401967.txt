the location and the staff were highlights as was the spacious breakfast room with three rooms everything worked most of the time and when there were questions or requests they were dealt with immediately it was particularly nice that there was always a deep bowl full of apples at the front desk i especially liked the view of st peter s cathedral from the window of my room
