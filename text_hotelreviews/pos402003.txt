the hotel is in a great position in the city to visit all areas great transport connections just round the corner and within walking distance to all the main attractions the beds were comfortable there was plenty hot water the reception staff were very pleasant and helpful breakfast has plenty variety on offer however they could look at the flow as there was a lot of bottlenecks to get food and drinks
