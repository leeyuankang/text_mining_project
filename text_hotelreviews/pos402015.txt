the location is great within easy walking distance of the underground city restaurants and several major tourist attractions breakfast was good staff were generally helpful and happy to store our luggage when we went to budapest for a couple of nights we had a superior then standard room if your budget allows chose the superior bigger and better all round it it doesn t suggest you look elsewhere
