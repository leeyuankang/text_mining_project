everything including the facilities service and comfort was excellent but i was mostly impressed with the helpfulness of their staff i forgot a set of photo booth pictures which had very valuable meaning to me and when i contacted the hotel to see if they had found the forgotten item they replied immediately and even sent back my pictures with no extra charge
