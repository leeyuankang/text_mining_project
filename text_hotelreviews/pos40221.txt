great hotel very new decoration is very chic the swimming pool is really cool location is great mins to a metro station walking distance to many attractions lots of restaurants nearby staff very friendly the alarm went off on both nights which was annoying at first but got a handwritten apology card from the hotel along with a jar of candy that was a very nice gesture loved my stay hopefully they can fix the alarm and also the cabinets may need a bit more air venting can still smell the newly decorated smell coffee machine and kettle in the room free water in the lobby
