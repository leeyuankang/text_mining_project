i stayed in sacher and imperial hotels and no doubt sacher is the best in vienna as raring they offered me the best room overlooks the square it s stunning and beautiful the front desk assistant was so polite and professional he is very good another black long hair gril in breakfast was so sweet and caring the restaurant are very beautiful just a little compliant that the dinner is over price and not so delicious the next day the restaurant manager immediately regenised me and quickly appologised to me overall the best best hotel in vienna no doubt
