everything in the hotel is new and modern and it is very clean the safety is very good the only way you can use hotel elevator is with your room key best thing is the rooftop restaurant with perfect view and food drinks the location is also very good min to most famous shopping street via montenapoleone i highly recomend this hotel it s more than worth for the money
