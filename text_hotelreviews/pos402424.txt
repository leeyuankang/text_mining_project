the location the staff were very sweet and helpful there was an information desk that was useful for planning trips and checking for train schedules and how to use the metro and so on a lot of restaurants nearby milano centrale many arabic restaurants too they close late which is a bonus i love hotels with a turndown service makes life easier room was always very clean
