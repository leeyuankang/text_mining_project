beautifully appointed hotel with highly professional helpful and friendly staff it was my first stay here and only for night but nearly all the staff i encountered addressed me by my name superb and atmospheric bar where you are constantly supplied with delicious nibbles top breakfast but many of the cooked options are offered la carte
