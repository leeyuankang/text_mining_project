the location is amazing and in the middle of everything yet it s a calm street so not much noise which is perfect our room was wonderful deluxe eifel tower view and we spent lots of time on the balcony enjoying the views because the weather was amazing when we stayed there the bathroom and shower is spacious i would absolutely stay here again in the same room
