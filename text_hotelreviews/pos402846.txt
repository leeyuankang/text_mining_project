i have been in the hotel several times and always stayed in reasonable rooms but this time the first room your staff offered was too small and then they gave us a horable room old dusty the curtains was from th century the tv was not working the image of your hotel was destroyed and i persuaded my colleagues and my client to stay in this hotel at least times your reception personal was very unwelcoming and not helpful after so many times we have been in your hotel the money and value was not balanced this time the personnel in the restaurant is also not very kind best regards
