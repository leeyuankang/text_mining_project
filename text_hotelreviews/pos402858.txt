awesome service from the front desk and duty manager during our stay while there is not much to do for young kids at the hotel there are a lot of places nearby they can spend hours in such as the park museum of natural history aquarium just to name a few rooms are very spacious compared to similar hotels in the area super clean hotel and very elegant
