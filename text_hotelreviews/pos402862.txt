breakfast was one of few places in italy where i was finally able to have my eggs toast and breakfast sausage definitely limited compared to other breakfast buffets i ve had but it was a good change to positano hotel where all i ate was croissants it s also overpriced though beds are very comfortable and some parts of the hotel are worth staring at for their architecture
