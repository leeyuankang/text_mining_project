as we traveled by train to milan the hotel was in a really good location minutes walk away from milan centrale the hotel was excellent and all of the staff were very helpful both in the dining room and on reception the breakfast was amazing and although the evening meal was included in the price which was a real bonus we did go out on a couple of occasions preferring to eat in the old part of the city would certainly recommend to friends or other travelers
