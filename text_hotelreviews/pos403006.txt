excellent location very modern and very well maintained the staff were very helpful and courtious rooms are a good size and very comfortable we had a few small issues on arrival that were sorted out very promptly and efficently we stayed at the hotel at the beginning and the end of our holiday to lake como and it suited our needs as a link to the city centre and the airport i ll definitely use again if i m when i visit milan
