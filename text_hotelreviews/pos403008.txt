i travel to milan every week i have tried many hotels this hotel was ok the tourist were tourists given the location it is quite touristy the breakfast was worth a look however i recommend you avoid the orange juice not sure what the machine thinks it is doing but it really isn t orange juice not even close go water or coffee dinner well if i was on holiday and had my family we could eat it wasn t so bad nothing there for me after a long day in the office
