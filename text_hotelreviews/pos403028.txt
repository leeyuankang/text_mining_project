we arrived early and were given access to our room on the top floor the room was spacious and modern with a good view of the square outside milano centrale station we were given half board and the food was very basic but the drinks expensive for a very small bottle of coke there are a number of good restaurants within walking distance the hop on hop off bus stops outside the hotel we would recommend this hotel for a short stay especially for the easy access to malpensa airport by train
