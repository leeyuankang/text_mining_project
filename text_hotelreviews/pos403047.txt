the glam hotel is placed near the railway station and has a subway station in front of it it was a great location for us because we stayed five days in milan but three days we travelled by train to lakes the room was nice very clean with a great view over the railway station market especially in the evening when the lights were on wifi worked good the staff was friendly and helpful during this trip it was the first time when we were stuck in the elevator we called the front desk and since we announced it they let us free in a really short time the breakfast and dinner have been included in the room price both were very good very tasty and we could choose between a lot of dishes
