overall this was a great hotel with a cool funky feel the location was good for us as we were there for night and arriving and leaving from milano centrale all other areas of milan were easily accessible by the metro with access just outside the hotel the bathroom was fabulous with a deep bathtub and overhead rainwater shower i will warn people though that the ledge of the bath is wide and the step down is deep i slipped on my first night and landed with the ledge at the back of my thigh lovely bruise for the rest of our trip the bar was a nice area but wasn t always staffed we had to get reception to call for service not a problem but maybe something the hotel could look at improving there are some great restaurants nearby on the street the hotel s entrance is on we didn t feel overly safe at night by the station but other areas were fine if i was to go back to milan i would consider staying here again
