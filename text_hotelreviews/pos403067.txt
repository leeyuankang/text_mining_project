the location of the hotel high up on the hill the room was very simple with no tv etc so may not suit all but i suggest one should give it a go we would walk down to the town via the many steps and catch the bus back up breakfast was included which was very nice there was just something about this hotel that made us feel really comfortable would recommend to anyone
