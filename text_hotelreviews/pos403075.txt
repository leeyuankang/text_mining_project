it is just in front of the central station and then you can walk to all the sightsing spots of the city great evening buffet and i would like to praise their effort of minimizing the waste of food by asking people to take only what they are capable of eating very good sallad and warm food options and you can buy the wine per glass tea kettle in the room and wonderful views of the central station very good breakfast with lots of options
