this was my second time booking at glam hotel modern hotel with a very cooperative nice staff which you rarely find in european hotels i had a problem with the safety deposit box and the maintenance guy arrived to the room in two minutes the rooms are very clean a bit small but good for european standards half board was a plus good variety of food on both breakfast and dinner easy to get anywhere as the hotel is minutes away from the milan train station i used to pay a lot for taxis when getting to the city center euros the location of the hotel made it easy for me to get into express bus from mxp airport for euro per person would book here again and again
