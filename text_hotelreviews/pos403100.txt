modern quirky decor quad room for a family of four rarely found but highly appreciated view of the central station and the plaza in front of it beautiful included dinner with a selection of italian cheeses cold meats salads and olives together with soup hot dishes in bain marie fresh fruit and deserts all surprisingly tasty dinner service starts at pm and there is a bit of a stampede at that time breakfast also included in the room rate was excellent provided you stuck to the continental selection croissants were exceptional
