dinner was included which was a surprise nothing amazing but quite satisfactory at the end of long day overall super stylish super modern and great location in terms of accessibility my room had a view of milano central which was lovely but i imagine that some of the other rooms facing other directions may not have had as nice a view looking at other nondescript buildings
