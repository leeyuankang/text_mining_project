stunning modern hotel more or less at the entrance to the beautiful stazione centrale i have stayed in many hotels in this area and the glam is by far the best most hotels in and around the area are traditional and therefore lack the modern amenities that the glam offers super friendly staff and a good breakfast help makes this arguably the best hotel in this area
