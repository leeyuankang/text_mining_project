the staff has been outstanding everybody was extremely friendly and helpful as an example there was a small cleanliness issue with my room no need to tell the details stuff that happens and my case was managed fast and professionally i was even upgraded to a better room for the disturbance on the decor except for some color choices that are questionable the decor is up to date and overall has a modern vibe view from the rooms is quite nice also thanks to the very big windows my room was spacious and the bathroom was very good with a very large and comfortable shower position is very handy as it literally minutes walk from the main station and an underground just in front of the hotel allows you to move around the city easily
