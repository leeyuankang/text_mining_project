the location of the hotel was perfect just across the street from the milan central station and few steps from the metro minutes walk from the shopping areas and city center hotel is clean comfortable and the buffet breakfast and dinner were excellent with lot of choices and the speed in refilling the buffet was amazing we got a junior suite with a perfect view of the station and the street the staff were amazing helpful and smiling even though we got an electricity problem but the staff was so quick in responding and fixing it even at in the morning i definetly recommend glam hotel
