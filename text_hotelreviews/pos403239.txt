the breakfast was nice and had a decent selection to accommodate anyone gluten free rolls were available if you ask server the area to get to the buffet is very congested and annoying good location for access to centrale station but a bit far from most attractions done up well average furnishings and finishes with each floor decorated in a different colour scheme big bathroom and bathtub staff was professional and polite and every staff member greeted us when we walked by there was a mix of guests plenty of tourists and tourists with kids did see quite a few gentlemen with their nieces which was unexpected we had booked online for nights and asked to check out early after day but were told that we would be charged for the night thought that was a bit rough since we had already stayed and paid for nights i would not choose this venue upon another visit to milan as it does not suit us but i could recommend to friends
