this hotel was perfect for a night stay i was travelling to and from by train and the hotel is extremely convenient located just across the street from the main station the room was clean and basic and looked like it was recently remodelled the bed was fine a little bit of street noise nothing unexpected one particularly nice thing was the half board which means buffet dinner and breakfast included if on vacation i m sure many people would prefer to check out some of the local cuisine but for a quick stay or work trip this is very convenient there was a good selection with options for people who don t eat dairy or wheat it wasn t advertised as such but they were there i would stay again
