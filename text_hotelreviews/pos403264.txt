first of all i want to thank all persons working at the reception specially tiziano he was very nice and cooperative which is very important after long flights to meet nice people like him at glam hotel you will find all people working at the reception smiling most of the time and happy to help in any thing and i think this was the best thing at glam hotel beside the location is excellent also half board with dinner is an excellent add on because it really save much money in milan with many expensive restaurants although varieties are not much but still good quality food with italian dishes and fish every night was very very good for people who wants to avoid meat and chicken
