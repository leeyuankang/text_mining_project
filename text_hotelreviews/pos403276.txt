amazing new hotel at best possible location stylish trendy comfortable and very cozy even though windows overlook central station square the room is very quiet and you can fully relax and enjoy the designed bathroom and pleasant interior of the room the breakfast had a variety of choices and was very tasty italian ham cheese but also standard but quality continental choice we definitely enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting milan as one of the best values for money you can get
