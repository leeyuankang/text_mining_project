helpful staff i came after midnight and was checked in into a room with a poor view requested for another one and was moved into the room with a great one all of requests were met and satisfied almost immediately i requested a breakfast box and it was waiting for me at the reception and many other things proper cleaning and neat environment over all big beds really comfortable though and very nice bedding very good breakfast fast service and welcoming staff you can get a good coffee all kind of eggs by order but no extra charges fresh pastry salads etc you name it location is really good it s not really close to the center and it takes about min to get to duomo but the subway station is literally steps away from the entrance door wifi is good and fast and you can join up to devices though you ll have to log in a bit too often rooms are soundproof and no noises bother you neither from your neighbors nor from the street on line check in is a good idea
