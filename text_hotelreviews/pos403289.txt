it was very modern and clean the staff were lovely at check in and as we had arrived early they were happy to hold our bags for us until our room was ready we hadn t realised we had half board with our booking so that was a lovely extra bonus and the food was very nice the location was a plus for us in getting to the airport and around the city in such a short time frame
