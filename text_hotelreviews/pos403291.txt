excellent location across the road from milan station metro at the door meant stops to duomo and all the sights of milan we had a very spacious comfortable clean room on the floor with amazing views over the station and the forecourt the dinner and breakfast buffets were excellent with lots of fresh tasty choices staff very friendly and helpful great value and would definitely stay there again
