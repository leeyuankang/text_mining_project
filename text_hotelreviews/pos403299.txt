i think the criticisms of the hotel are ridiculous it s great value excellent service and unbeatable convenience the half board option is included in the room rate the breakfast is above par the dinner is ok but what would the miserable complainers be paying outside a minimum of euros for wine and a primi sample your amazing italian food for lunch but really this hotel offers excellent value those who say otherwise are inexperienced travelers
