the location is perfect located just across the main train station bus and metro stations are just a step away from the hotel entrance we appreciate it very much that we got upgraded to a junior suite that has an awesome view of the main road and the train station our rooms had a floor to ceiling glass window which gave so much brightness to the room we loved it that the front desk staff are very helpful and accommodating also the waiters at the breakfast and dinner room we forgot to get the name of the very warm and friendly waiter who looks like chris evans other than very good looking and well versed in english he is very hard working he never stopped moving everyone seem to speak english well we loved the modern and cool design of this hotel too our daily room rate includes half board meals breakfast and dinner buffet which we found very economical and convenient needless to say delicious too will definitely consider this hotel next time we come back
