it was a great stay for a short visit we booked a triple room with breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by complimentary dinner also being offered when we checked in the food was surprisingly nice for a complimentary buffet dinner the breakfast was nice too lots of selection all staff members we met front desk restaurant were amazing super friendly and helpful location was great for us because it was just a short stay before our next train ie just across the street from milano central but is not a walking distance to the major attraction however it was easily accessible by metro which is just outside the hotel definitely will stay again on our next visit great value for money no doubt
