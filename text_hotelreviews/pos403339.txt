the location is great if you plan on moving around by public transportation like metro or train the breakfast offers an ample variety of items for all tastes dinner is also good my advice would be to avoid peak times because people tend to annoy and to behave like the hotel will run out of food or something similar having either breakfast or dinner at later hours would save you from feeling in a the walking dead scene since people tend to fight either for tables closer to the buffet area or for food the service at the bar was outstanding the man was so polite and served us the best coffee we had in milan
