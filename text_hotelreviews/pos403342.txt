the staff was very friendly and helpful for example they knew the closest vodaphone vendor and their hours as i was looking for sim chip for my phone location is very convenient to milano centrale if you are flying into milan and taking train out it doesn t get any easier than this dinner was included in our stay and was fairly priced for a buffet for a jet lagged couple this was appreciated beds were comfortable and we lucked out and got a great view of the train station
