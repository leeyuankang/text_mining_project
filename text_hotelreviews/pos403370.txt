the location of the hotel is the best i ve come across in my travels the view from the room was perfect as you could see the milan central station as well as many people everyday passing by below the rooms were perfectly sound proof the breakfast and dinner were perfect and had good selection the room facilities were ideal for a business traveller with enough power points as well as good wifi network staff were very friendly and helpful definitely a place to stay again
