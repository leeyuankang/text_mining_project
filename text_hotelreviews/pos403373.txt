i loved everything about this place it s right opposite to the train station it is new and has a cool vibe to the ambience and room decor the staff were great i dropped off some bags at the concierge and they offered to leave it in my room things like that decent dinner and breakfast although i only had breakfast which wasn t a big spread but good enough i didn t stay there long and i wished i did i will definitely stay there when i go to milan again
