the room was a good size the hotel is really close to the central railway station its easy to get to the tourist attractions the hop on tourist bus has a stop just outside the hotel the buffet dinner was a surprise the selection of food was good and it was fresh and hot we did get in early and i could perhaps see things running out towards the end of service
