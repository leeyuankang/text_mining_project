if you are looking for a modern and spacious room next to the train station this is the place just steps to the station and the staff is very welcoming the half board is excellent with a bountiful banquet offered at both breakfast and dinner we were simply passing through milan so are not able to comment on proximity to shopping and sightseeing but certainly if you are travelling as we were this was an excellent transit stop highly recommended
