we came to milano by train only for two nights so we decided to stay in a hotel near the central railway station there are many hotels so it was hard to decide we always stay only in or star hotels but we know star isn t always star i think we chose the best hotel among star hotels in this area hotel was built just one year ago what means it is very clean and in the best condition the room was not so large but big enough to open big suitcases it s built in modern design with unusual but wonderful colour combination beds were firm and very comfortable there s a kettle in the room with complimentary coffee and tea and air conditioner was working well bathroom was large enough and there was bidet too towels were big and of good quality there was a pair of slippers but we missed bathrobes the etro bathroom amenities were very good the best things of the hotel are location kind staff and complimentary light dinner staff at the reception were very kind what make your day when you check in at dinner we liked giovanni who was very kind and helpful with a smile on his face and a housekeeper was very kind and helpful and did all what we asked her for the location of the hotel is really the best the entrance of the very convinient subway is just at the entrance of the hotel and the railway station is just across the street you need less than minutes to the center or popular via montenapoleone and the subway is very easy to use we just came from new york where we were shocked at very dark subway the subway in milano is clean easy to understand and safe the breakfast was good and the light dinner that is included was much more than we had expected really great dinner with many kind of dishes and a lot of vegetables meat seafood fruit cakes really great if we visit milano again we will stay here and i would recommend it to everybody i think we will visit milano just to stay in glam hotel
