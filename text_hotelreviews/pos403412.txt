the location opposite milano centrale train station was ideal it was great to check in within minutes of arriving at the train station and it was also really convenient for catching the airport shuttle bus from just outside the train station staff were very helpful and found an available room when i arrived earlier than the usual check in the room was very clean the shower hot the bed comfortable and the wifi worked well i was also pleased to find a kettle in the room to make hot drinks having dinner included in the deal was a nice extra the food wasn t particularly special but it was nice enough and there were plenty of options likewise breakfast had lots of options although the quality was fairly standard all in all a great choice for a night or two in milan
