superb location within minute walking distance to everything and across the milan centrale station so no trudging bags around long distances largish rooms with designer cosmetics from etro bed was super duper comfortable very stylish hotel without going overboard on design would stay here again in my next trip breakfast was excellent dinner was fair considering it was included with room and with the rate paid if you find something interesting elsewhere you don t mind missing it
