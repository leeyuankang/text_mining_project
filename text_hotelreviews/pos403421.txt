location right next to the station we stayed here for night only after being in italy for weeks some times in apartments other times in hotels this place ticked all the boxes for me had large bedroom with sitting room furnished with a divan sofa coffee table comfortable chairs great bathroom loved the vibrant decor buffet breakfast was wonderful the included buffet dinner was excellent could nt have asked for more great value for your money those people with negative comments should have maybe chosen a more expensive hotel there are plenty in milano
