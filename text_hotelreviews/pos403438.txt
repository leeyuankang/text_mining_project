very friendly helpful staff they upgraded my room to a suite with a great view over the square and the railway station the location was exceptionally good for my purposes i came in on the train and then had to go to the airport the following day it s walking distance to the station and the buses to the airports depart from the station this avoids having to get an expensive taxi to and from other more traffic choked central parts of the city there was some confusion on my part with my bill and the hotel followed up very quickly by e mail to clarify the d cor in my suite was striking in a modern way wi fi was good and reliable altogether a very good experience i would most certainly stay there again
