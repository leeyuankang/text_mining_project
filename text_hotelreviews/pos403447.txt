the hotel is in an excellent location for the holidaying visitor we have stayed in milan several times and this has been by miles the most convenient location the holiday maker could require the hotel itself was very comfortable and the staff are warm friendly and accommodating our room was well serviced and comfortable despite the expected traffic noise etc our room seemed cocooned from this environmental noise food was fresh plentiful and served in a pleasant dining area
