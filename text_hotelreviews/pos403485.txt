this hotel is great value for money there is a train station right outside the door of glam hotel the service was excellent and the staff were very friendly we had breakfast at the hotel and there was a good selection of food from sausages to pancakes and tartes dinner was also perfect the food was very tasty i do recommend going all inclusive as it can be very boring eating pizza and pasta everyday at other resturants we were kindly upgraded to a junior suite as the lady at the reception told us that the superior room we booked has a glass bathroom and gave us the option to upgrade for free which was very kind of her the room was great and so was the view very clean and tidy i really reccomend this hotel it made my stay in milan better
