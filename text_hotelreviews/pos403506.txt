i thought that this hotel was a little out of the ordinary run of the mill large city hotels with some interesting stylish features it is very convenient for anyone travelling by train and arriving departing from the central station and the metro is just at the front of the hotel and only stops to the duomo the buffet breakfast provided a superb choice the front desk staff were all exceptionally helpful noise was not a problem
