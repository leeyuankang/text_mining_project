i ve been saying at this hotel times now my main reason for choosing it is the convenient location and the clean comfortable rooms it s a new hotel and that makes a difference i recently discovered the half board offering and i am very pleased i read a few negative comments regarding the food which i don t understand maybe because i m vegetarian there are plenty of choices of warm dishes salads and vegetables fruits and cheeses for the price of this hotel you would normally not get half board for a business traveler it is great for someone looking for a romantic dinner with table service don t expect that here but explore the cities options i also like the breakfast and the option of soy milk yogurt
