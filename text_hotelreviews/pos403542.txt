the hotel is a relatively new and is conveniently located near the milan central station i stayed in the standard double room which overall i enjoyed the room is a good size and the setup is nice as the bed is comfortable and there are plenty of electric sockets and lighting throughout the room the room also has a flat screen tv which has cnn and some other english tv stations other things that are important which i enjoyed about the room is that the heating and air conditioning worked well it has nice big windows the bathroom had heated towel racks and the bathroom products are of good quality i found all the staff to be excellent from the reception to the doorman to the people who work at the bar and restaurant more specifically i found the staff to be young energetic attentive and nice another great thing is that the wifi worked well throughout the hotel as it is fast and easy to log onto which is important especially if you are travelling for business the breakfast buffet has a good selection and is convenient because it runs until furthermore if there is something that you want that is not part of the breakfast buffet the staff is there to provide you with what you want directly from the kitchen overall the hotel offers great value is clean and has a modern look and feel i would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again as i am a frequent traveller to milan and have stayed in many hotels there
