the location of the hotel is excellent just a minute walk from the central station metro entrances are also just outside the hotel from where one can travel on the green and yellow lines the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful which made a lot of difference as this was my first trip to italy i was on the floor and my room had an excellent view the room the bathroom bedsheets pillow covers and towels were very neat and clean and there was no smell the breakfast was also very nice my omelet was served with very nice and fresh green vegetables on the side every day my flight was at in the night and upon my request the hotel allowed me a late checkout till in the afternoon which allowed a little time to relax and shop for gifts for my family there were just minor hiccups along the way like my laundry was delayed the first days my room was a little warm and one morning there was some problem with the hot water but all these problems were fixed without much stress so all in all it was a very good experience
