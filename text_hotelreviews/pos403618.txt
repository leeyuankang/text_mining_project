the hotel was excellent from start to finish the staff were friendly and went out of their way to make my stay pleasant we had dinner in the restaurant which was lovely and breakfast the next morning was just as good the location of the hotel is perfect just across the road from the main centrale train station quiet rooms with everything you need really like the power showers the wifi was also brilliant i will definitely be staying here during my next visit to milan
