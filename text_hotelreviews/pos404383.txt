you become awestruck when you see this hotel it s beautiful it has an old school charm mixed with contemporary styling and the mix is so good that you fall in love with it the location is good it is opposite to the milan central train station duomo is easily accessible by a taxi the hotel staff is so courteous at par with any leading hotel of the world full marks to the staff our room was big airy and beautiful it had a gallery to open the door and enter the outside gallery area the hotel staff will ask you to sign a declaration no fuss about it just sign it and the guy will come with a key to open the door simple clean rooms with a mini bar electric kettle and multiple ports for charging breakfast takes place on the ground floor and they have a plethora of choices not good for vegetarians as they have only fruits and desserts for them the maserati given by the hotel for their guests is a nice touch we enjoyed the drive thoroughly slightly on the expensive side but when in milan do dedicate a few days from your trip and stay in the lap of luxury highly recommended
