this is an extremely modern and luxurious hotel we were given an upgrade to two suites that were both spectacular because they didn t have connecting rooms ok thank you they did everything in their power to make us comfortable from the afternoon snacks turn down service and all staff the bathrooms might be the most spectacular i have seen with every modern convince i look very forward to my return the linens and towels were also amazing we had room service and the food was extremely good and plentiful it was also the price of local restaurants so we did not feel they overpriced the food
