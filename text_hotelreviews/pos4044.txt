despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history hotel russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should the staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable i also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room i look forward to coming back throughout the years to come
