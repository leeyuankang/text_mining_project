location to two metro stops on line ideal for travel into major spots staff lovely bakery right on the corner really nice value for money good if you book ahead on booking com not quite if you are being picky but some nice touches like free tea and pastry down stairs in the afternoon we loved it be careful of down town moulin rouge can get a bit seedy
