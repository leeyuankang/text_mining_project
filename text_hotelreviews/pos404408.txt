the number of front staff is enough to smoothly take care of all guests we did not wait for long time to both check in and check out even though there were quite many guests in the front hall at the time plus all staff are very kind of handling my inquiries with quick respond and gentle guides the dinning room for breakfast is excellent luxury atmosphere good quality of meal and good attitude of staff make us very comfortable thank you very much
