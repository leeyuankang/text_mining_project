my wife and i are traveling all over italy days total staying in locations while in capri i had a nasty fall resulting in several stitches in my elbow so when i arrived in milan at the excelsior hotel i was hurting and had to find a place to remove my stitches so i asked for the help of a young man named filipo at the excelsior front desk he said this request was unusual and it was the day before easter a serious italy holiday as the hospital was closed he asked if he could do his homework and call my room in minutes he called as he said he delivered written details to me he had every detail arranged i was in and out of the hospital emergency care ward in minutes thanks to filipo thank god for him that night we had a wonderful meal at the main dining room and over our next day stay there the hotel worked out perfectly as we had hoped it was so close to the central train station we were in and out of trains and subways several times per day our stay there could not have been better thank you excelsior
