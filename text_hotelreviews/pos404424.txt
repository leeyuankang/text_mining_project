the staff were incredible from the concierge to the waiters the reception drivers butlers all were incredibly helpful knowledgeable and happy to assist to our random needs the hotel and rooms are beautifully decorated and the restaurant and terrace upstairs are lovely this is a must stay especially as they take you into the center of town with their maserati
