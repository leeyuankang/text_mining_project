this was the best overall hotel experience that either my wife or myself have ever been through it was our honeymoon and the staff made it beyond imaginable they were so nice and they went above and beyond in making sure that we felt special and had a great time not to mention the hotel itself was spectacular it was very clean and had amazing features we highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is in milano cannot thank the staff enough for the best experience we could have ever asked for during our honeymoon if we ever find ourselves back in milano we will be staying here again
