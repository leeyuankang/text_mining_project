excellent reception by the manager upon our arrival upgraded our room following a room mix up and offered complimentary dinner by means of apology the concierge was also very helpful and the location of the hotel was fantastic for access to public transport on our last day the hotel kept our bags secure while we enjoyed the remainder of our time in london will most certainly be staying again
