great hotel we stayed here in june perfect location to get around milan surrounded by wonderful places to eat and relax and the shops the cathedral is literally minutes walk away rooms are clean beautiful and spacious we had a long meandering walk from the elevators to our rooms but we didn t mind there s no noise from outside considering it is right next to the duomo the lobby is nice bar area is large with lots of comfy sofa s staff are very polite and want to make sure your stay is great wifi is very good across the whole complex the price is fair i would definitely stay here again if i return to milan
