the staff the valet parking the location the comfy rooms the amenities the bar restaurant decor everything about this hotel is spot on we only stayed here one night but this is one of my favorite hotels now they really make you feel special and the hotel itself is beautiful a touch of luxury that helps you unwind after shopping or trying to get emergency documents at the consulates as we unfortunately had to i very much look forward to returning some day
