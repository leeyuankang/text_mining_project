the location is unbeatable if you want to stay close to the duomo it was easy to get everywhere by foot metro or tram the personnel at the desk in particular enrico were very professional friendly and helpful the breakfast had some nice italian elements colombo and panetonne and the service was quick the rooms were very nice and well designed overall a great hotel i would come back again loved the illy coffee machine in the room
