perfect location step out of the door and you are at the duomo the main piazza and all the shops you could wish for we even had a view of the duomo from our room easy bus journey no bus from linate to san babila tickets each just jump off as soon as you see the duomo or at san babila for a short walk to the hotel we would not stay anywhere else and definitely plan to return hotel itself faultless beautiful d cor friendly staff and lovely room breakfast was great with lots of choice we walked everywhere but the metro trams and buses make getting around milan very easy
