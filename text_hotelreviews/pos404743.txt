amazing location only minute walk to the duomo easily reach the beautiful shopping precinct in milan staff very helpful and happy fantastic breakfast offered but a little expensive go and try one of the local cafes they are great and offer good breakfasts or stop for a coffee and croissant if you stand at the counter and have your coffee instead of sitting at the table you don t get charged a service fee thats what the locals do on their way to work
