fantastic room quiet on floor very spacious with our daughter s bed separated from our section by low wall and separate toilet and luggage rooms beds were very comfortable and generous range of toiletries breakfast buffet was also very generous with good fruit and cheese large range of breads and couple of decent hot offerings mushrooms overall the hotel s location was unbeatable in fact i think we got a bit spoiled being so central to the duomo wifi was free and worked well
