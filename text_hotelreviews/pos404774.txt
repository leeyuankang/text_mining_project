only stayed one night before heading to the airport the next morning but we were very happy with the accommodations location was great for restaurants and seeing the sigts in milan very comfortable beds plush towels quiet room and great wifi since we were traveling with our two children we really appreciated the ability to book two connecting rooms and the option to choose single beds in one room there were six of us in total and we also appreciated that the hotel arranged for a minivan to take us to the airport for the of us it was euros which seemed like a bargain over taking two cabs which would have cost euro a piece had we known better it may have been a smarter option for us to stay the one night near the airport but this allowed us to see a few sights and probably find better restaurants for our last night in europe
