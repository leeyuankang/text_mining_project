the location is great right next to the duomo and shopping areas lots of cafes restaurants within walking distance the breakfast buffet was ok but not really worth the euros we had to get a family room because we had adults and children it was a good sized room on the first floor but the room itself was a little run down i was expecting better based on the photos
