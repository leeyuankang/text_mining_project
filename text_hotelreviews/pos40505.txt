what can i say the staff in this hotel is one of the friendliest we have ever met extremely polite and helpful a lot of extra touches that made our stay even more enjoyable the location in madeleine is a great one a calm neighbourhood with plenty of small good restaurants and pubs around be careful though the majority will close early and on the weekends not to worry though as the champs elysees is just a few minutes walk away
