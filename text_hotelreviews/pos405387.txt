i stayed at this boutique hotel for my birthday and it was perfect the staff were so lovely and accommodating as we were new to milan so we had to treat them with a bottle of prosecco to say thank you brit style the location was great also literally seconds from gerusalemme metro stop and walking distance to sempione we clubbed in the evenings and the hotel booked a taxi for us that can take you to milans hotspots corsmo como duomo sempione for under euros even past midnight when it comes to aesthetics i m very particular with hotels but the interior was very pretty and modern i must say the bathroom especially was very posh and exceeded my expectations i would definitely stay here again and a special thanks to everyone here for being so helpful and sweet
