the interior design of the lobby is awesome large open space with huge mirrors well furnished unfortunately with some traces of leaks on the ceiling our room was on the first floor reachable from a long dark stairway we had a view on the interior garden from our room which was nice rooms shared the same terrace on the first floor but it was long enough so this was not really a problem for us the bathroom was nice and clean large enough for a couple and it had a window the room was well equipped cleaned daily the coffee at the breakfast was great you have just to ask for it it s free
