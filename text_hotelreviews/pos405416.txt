it was a very nice surprise to walk in there wasn t much on the outside to suggest a hotel but once you stepped in it was a definetly wow beautiful foyer and artful decorations and some cosy narrow pathways with more comfortable looking sitting areas room we had a superior suite and it did not only have two rooms but also two fully equipped bathrooms what luxury breakfast too had a friendly atmosphere with one big table and lots to choose from staff was very friendly and helpful and had many suggestions especially the pizzeria and gelateria they told us about were a treat
