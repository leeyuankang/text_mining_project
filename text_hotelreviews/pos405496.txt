the hotel was based in a residential district only from milan centre there was public transport right outside property if required but the weather was beautiful during our stay so my wife and i enjoyed the exceptional walk through semipone park and sforzesco castle into the centre every day all staff at the hotel were very helpful and polite i expected only croissants and coffee for breakfast but to my surprise there was meats cheeses lovely cake and fruit all available there was also bacon and scrambled eggs cooked to perfection i did book a suite in the hotel for my stay as it was very reasonably priced and had a massive king size bed the room overlooked the streets below and a small childrens play park there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the vicinity of the hotel which were very good china town is about mls away when booking this break i originally searched for hotels in the centre but so glad i changed my mind and picked the mozart hotel it was my first trip to milan and what a beautiful city it is if i do decide to return and there are vacancies at the mozart i will definitely be staying there
