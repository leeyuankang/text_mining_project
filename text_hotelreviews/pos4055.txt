i have stayed at this hotel a few times now and can never find any major faults with it it has great connections on the tube however is in walking distance to your main shopping areas and sight seeing staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is as you expect it to be the room was spacious and very comfy bed i will stay here again
