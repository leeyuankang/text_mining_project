what wasn t there to like we loved the decor the period charm and the sense of being swept in the parisian lifestyle beautiful luxurious boutique hotel generous and friendly staff who catered for all our needs superbly and with a smile if we are in paris again on our next travels we would be booking this hotel for our stay as it was wonderful
