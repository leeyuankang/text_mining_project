old fashioned hotel in a quite good sense not too big minibar in the room some extras in the bathroom quiet place to sleep breakfast was average for my liking but one can order any coffee from the polite waiter and waitress hotel is next to a brand new metro station gerusalemme and it is easy to buy a single or one day ticket from the machine great i had a single room for euros which i consider a good deal
