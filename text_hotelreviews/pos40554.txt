we have been staying at the san regis for over years we love the quiet comfort and perfect location of this intimate beautiful and charming hotel we have been guests at a few of the great hotel palaces of paris but much prefer the san regis the hotel will fulfill any of the requests you might think only a large five star hotel could accommodate but the difference being that it is all done on a very personal level i guess we enjoy the familiarity of going to a place in a foreign country where everybody knows your name we truly love this hotel and the parisian memories they have helped us create
