this place is not a hotel it is more like staying in a wealthy friends house parisien rooms are notoriously small but our room was spacious and gorgeous i usually dont like wallpaper but my god in our room it was a work of art and incredibly expensive i would imagine the staff are lovely i especially liked nicholas the concierge downstairs is just one room really but it is beautiful a great place to stay
