the location of the hotel is quite good well connected to the city centre metro the new purple line relatively close to main points like central station and porta garibaldi trains staff is polite and helpful but depending on what you ask i was denied switching on the central heating or air conditioning because we were not in the right season so the heating season was over in april but it was still cold in the hotel the breakfast is quite well organized all the products are fresh and the hygiene is at high level
