the breakfast was really good and we had everything we needed you dont have to think that everything will be gone from the buffet if you are waking up late the city center is around min away if you decide to walk you could also take the metro but i would suggest to walk as you will cross the beautiful park and old buildings etc many little restaurants and places you could sit at night the hotel from outside doesn t look so nice but the inside is clean comfortable and staff is nice too
