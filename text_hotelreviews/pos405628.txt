we stayed in this hotel for one week during christmas the hotel is not exactly in the centre of milan and there are like two train changes to arrive near the duomo but for the price we paid it was quite a nice hotel and the metro is only mins away in the room we had a nice shower tea coffee making facilities that were given for free when we asked i also forgot my toothbrush and they gave me a new one immediatly also one day we had to catch a train early in the morning and since we had to skip breakfast they prepared for us a small breakfast to take on the trip with us in summery all our requests were always met so thumbs up to the staff few mins away from the hotel there is a hairdresser and also a very very big supermarket were you can buy almost anything across the street there is also an amazing restaurant which specialaize in fish called arrow s which is worth a try almost all the staff was helpful and friendly except one of the breakfast womans with black hair and glasses who was always so pissed off unfortunatley the breakfast had a large variaty of sweets a bit less choice of food the scrambled egg was something we didnt like so much as it had a funny sweet taste also if you want to have a drink at the bar they offer also free nibbles after which we thought was a nice gesture i did not give star only because the location is far away from the centre otherwise the hotel is very value for money thankyou for making our holiday a little more perfect
