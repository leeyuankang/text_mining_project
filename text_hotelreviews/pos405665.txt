the hotel was clean and comfortable staff were ok not enthusiastic i like a good bathroom and the bathroom was spacious with spacious vanity area found the lighting not too great i think it was just the room i was allocated as a single traveller was slightly awkward as a corner room i needed to dress for special occasion and found the lighting not too great they serve a good breakfast
