very close to the duomo we were given a beautiful and large room at the front of the hotel but did not get any sleep due to the screeching of the trams the hotel moved us to a back room for the second night which was very quiet rooms were very comfortable with great ammenities very good breakfast staff very helpful lots of cafes nearby go to the top floor terrace for a spectacular view of milan
