we had booked a triple room through booking com and on arrival the third bed was a sofa bed after travelling and paying what we did for one night accommodation this is not good if you are booking a room for three it s something you look out for is the bed type and sofa bed should always be specified which it is on most listings on booking com we ended up changing room which was ok lumpy mattresses and utilities provided were for two not three
