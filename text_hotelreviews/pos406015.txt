the hotel is ideally located with a metro station just outside the hotel doors and the piazza del duomo just a couple of corners away the roof terrace bar is delightful with a great panorama of the inner city the wifi service is exceptionally good the breakfast is also excellent but can get a little crowded the staff are pleasant and helpful
