everything was fantastic the room was beautiful and comfortable the bathroom was huge and spotless the staff were polite and welcoming and helped my husband to surprise me with flowers and prosecco for my birthday in our room on arrival the rooftop terrace was wonderful if a but pricey for drinks and aperitivi snacks and a fantastic view the breakfast room was amazing and the selection and service outstanding the location was excellent less than minutes walk to the duomo and great value for money in such an expensive city
