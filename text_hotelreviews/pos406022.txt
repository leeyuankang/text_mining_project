a perfect city hotel just minutes from the duomo shops and restaurants quick check in and out friendly staff i was staying with my daughters and the room was a good size with comfortable beds and the bathroom had a bath and shower with a good range of toiletries we liked the fact the room had a kettle unusual in italy so we could make our own tea at bedtime without having to call room service or go out to a cafe breakfast had a good varied selection including fresh fruit bread croissants and cakes
