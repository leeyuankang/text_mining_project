experience we had a fantastic experience at the hotel i was travelling with a group of clients including one who requested to sign in four hours ahead of check in time i called ahead and this was accommodated for with no fuss in addition i asked if a number of gifts could be given to the guests on arrival and the reception were more than happy to manage this for us the piece de resistance was the rooftop terrace what a surprise we all enjoyed a spritz whilst admiring the beautiful views of the city at sunset rooms are spacious clean and everything has been thought of can t recommend this place enough and the location is perfect despite being so close the the centre the rooms are very quiet at night
