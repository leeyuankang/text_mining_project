a nice clean modern hotel within walking distance of place de trocadero eiffel tower just around the corner from one of my favorite brewpubs in paris the frog xiv expensive but not compared to other hotels in the area one exceptional thing about this hotel it s probably the quietest hotel i ve ever stayed in when in paris
