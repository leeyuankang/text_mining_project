a luxiously decorated hotel very close to main piazza but far enough away to feel a bit private the rooftop has a fabulous outlook the staff in the hotel were welcoming and helpful which was lovely as we do not speak italian the buffet breakfast was excellent and staff very hardworking and attentive cleaning of room excellent hotel is close to underground train and trams to get a little further away although taxi cost was very reasonable
