had an amazing view the hotel is gorgeous and the roof top terrace is amazing and trendy spot at night water pressure was nice lots of hot water location is perfect to walk to shops doumo and other things soft nightlight on dryer was a nice touch remember you are in italy and staying in a very old building and city don t expect everything to be like modern new cities in america or australia i love this hotel
