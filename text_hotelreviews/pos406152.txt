ratings say it all we spent one night on our way back home to deutschland and that one night certainly impressed us great room with comfortable bed big bathroom with slippers robe for pool big flat screen tv that wasn t used much since the balcony facing the valley presented an outstanding view of the spectacular alps indoor pool temp was just right and not over chlorinated surrounding lounge area was comfortable and quiet towels were available as was fruit for the eating we didn t use the sauna grounds surrounding the hotel included short walking paths under the eagles nest and around the property well kept grounds with water features and statues gave a relaxing yet upscale feel the michelin rated restaurant served one of the best meals we ve eaten side note we lived in vegas to years and ate out alot while the price of the room and restaurant is steep all things considered we would definitely return and are planning to in the near future
