the hotel was friendly and clean the location is perfect for the duomo area just mins walk from the hotel to the duomo piazza and mins walk to davinci s last supper mural but make sure you ve got a route pre planned as there weren t many signs the hotel is also right next to the central line metro stop missori so very easy to get to and from the main station or to get around milan via the metrol the breakfast is an all you can eat buffet with an abundance of choice from pastries and cakes to fruit and cereal or hot cooked eggs and bacon the roof terrace was a wonderful escape the roof terrace bar is closed in the afternoon but you can still use the lovely relaxing area and buy drinks from the reception bar we shared a triple room each with our own large bed en suite bathroom with plenty of towels and shampoos etc i would stay here again if we returned to milan the
