i liked the hospitality right from the start and really it made me feel at home the staff seemed motivated and passionate about what they were doing and that is the measure of engagement of any customer industry so the credit also to go to the arthur christina for leading the team with high spirits through out the stay i felt at ease and was given good care being a hr person and a trainer i could see the genuineness of the smiles and the passion to serve customers both arthur christina did not act as hosts but in fact did with professionalism and sincerity friendliness and politeness was felt in the air
