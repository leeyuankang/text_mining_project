excellent central location pleasant and helpful staff i stayed two separate nights during one week and had booked the same category room both times business double the first time the room was basic and sufficient for what i needed but i would have expected a bit more comfort for my second visit i received a room upgrade to an amazing suite which was fabulous the breakfast at this hotel is amazing well worth taking your time for in the morning the pastries are particularly nice but generally the selection of food and drink on offer is brilliant
