the hotel is rather lovely and the room was very comfortable with a beautiful big bed well appointed and decorated well bathroom was also great albeit a little dark as there was no window and all tiling was black great bar downstairs and also a lovely in house restaurant which served very good quality meals about a min walk to the duomo area so a great location very central
