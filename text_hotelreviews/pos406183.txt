breakfast was fabulous location very good first room we were given smelled bad but the hotel did move us and we were given a much better room also gave us a voucher for drinks at the bar to make up for the inconvenience all in all it was good breakfast was fabulous and they gave us a bag of goodies because we had to get to the airport early
