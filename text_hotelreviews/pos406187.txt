it s my second time at this hotel i love it s proximity to duomo walking and the missori underground station just in front of hotel which connects you perfectly with stazione centrale and the malpensa express amazing breakfast sparkling wine prosecco included lots of choices it had classy christmas decorations in the lobby and generally a nice classy atmosphere will return
