location and staff were amazing it s a minute walk from the train station which was very convenient there was also a grocery store beside the hotel my favourite part is it is away from the hustle and bustle which gave me a very safe and peaceful feeling one of the staff even helped me planning my whole itinerary and suggested amazing restaurants nearby definitely staying here again
