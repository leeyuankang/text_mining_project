i went with my children we were all so impressed with the spacious comfortable room the breakfeast was delicious i went for a swim every morning in the lovely pool and worked out in the gym the hotel was very central you couldnt get a better location so we went shopping on the hotels doorstep walked to the duomo museum of history and planatarium the metro was outside the hotels front door facilitating easy transport to milans many treasures great resturants such as sabatini where my kids had the best pizza ever and i had the tastiest homemade pasta all within minutes of the hotel
