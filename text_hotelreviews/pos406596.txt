this was our second stay at galles best western the hotel is gd for its location close proximity to the train station we liked the availability of triple quadruple rooms to accommodate our family we liked that breakfast was provided to us for a very small fee we picked the hotel also for its gym and pool it is right next to a shopping area where you have the street brands and within walking distance to afew supermarts if you need to grab some food
