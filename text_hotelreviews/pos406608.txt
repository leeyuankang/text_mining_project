great location on main shopping street not far from central station within reasonable walking distance of the duomo area but if you don t fancy the walk the metro is right outside the hotel excellent breakfast with great selection for all tastes lovely roof terrace with great view over the city good organisation at reception with very pleasant helpful staff also very secure system for leaving luggage after check out if you have a late flight would definitely stay here again
