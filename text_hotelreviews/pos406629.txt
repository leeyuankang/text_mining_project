the room was a good size for a city center hotel and despite facing onto the main road it was surprisingly quiet the staff were lovely always happy to help and smiling this hotel has things in particular that i thought were simple but made life so much easier firstly they offer a special repacking room so you can repack cases on arrival and check suit case weights before you fly etc on the last day we checked out but left our luggage at the hotel we returned several hours later and were able to comfortably repack our cases with all of our shopping they also had one power point in the bedroom which was permanently on not only when your key card was in the slot this meant we could leave things charging while out and about etc
