love this hotel so much it s about minute walk to the centre of milan out but they make up for this by how well equipped they are everything was so clean and tidy and the staff so helpful and friendly the breakfast was awesome and the roof top terrace were a bonus the spa is lovely and clean and relaxing i would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member and will definitely be staying in best westerns from now on
