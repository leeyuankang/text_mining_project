we were in transit from venice to paris and needed an overnight stay relatively close to both centrale and garibaldi railway stations we also wanted a place with a pool for the kids to have a swim this hotel ticked all the boxes the staff were very helpful with advice on transport options to get to garibaldi station and the room service was quick and good
