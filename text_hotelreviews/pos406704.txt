the location of this hotel couldn t be better if you like to shop and sight see this is a great place to stay buenos ares is a double street approximately long filled with shopping if you keep walking along you then join onto the spiaga which is all high end designer about away and in between is all buildings and parks you then reach the galleria and duomo which is more shopping highly recommend for the price quality and location there is also the centrale stazione down the road so you can train it to other parts of italy ie rapallo or use the shuttle bus service from outside the station not the hotel for euro to melpansa airport
