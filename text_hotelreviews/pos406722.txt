we loved loved this hotel we had a family suite which was elegant and very spacious after traveling for several weeks and staying in hotels that were much less attractive this was such a treat we loved the soft robes the slippers the gift of chocolates and water the beautiful decor and the very helpful staff although the gym was in the basement the showers in that area were excellent as well we were also really greatful for the fantastic breakfast served on the terraza with nice views of the city great hotel in a great location
