the hotel was lovely and clean i booked two superior rooms of but was only allocated one our room was extremely small we talked to the manager but he said it was superior maybe because they put gowns in the room we actually struggled to move with the suitcases in the room my reason for paying quite a bit extra for a bigger room breakfast was amazing good quality food and always replenished all and all a good experience
