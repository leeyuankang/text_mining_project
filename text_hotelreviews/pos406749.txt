good location by metro station excellent breakfast although loud and very busy good outdoor roof space for sitting sunbathing raphael on reception was a superstar we were not happy with our room at all as the website pictures were very misleading and for the price very over priced raphael listened to my disappointment and worked with me to delay my check in to try and find me a better room later in the day so we didn t check in on time but at least our room was closer to the one we were expecting all this thanks to raphael and his hard work and excellent customer service
