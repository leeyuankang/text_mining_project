it wasn t until we travelled further through france and stayed in other accommodations that we truly appreciated this one the staff knowledge was excellent especially for us as first timers to paris superior room was great size comfy beds and love having the coffee tea facilities many places did not have these things we have taken for granted in the past thank you for our stay
