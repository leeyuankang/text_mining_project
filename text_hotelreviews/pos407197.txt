the breakfast were way too good especially their croissant this is a definite plus if you are a breakfast person like us located just less opposite to the centrale station which makes it extra convenient and many restaurant around to choose from from romantic dinner averages at per person to cafeteria which you can get lovely pizza from as low as the hotel and their rooms are very clean
