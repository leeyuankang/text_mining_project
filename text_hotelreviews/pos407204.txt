the staff was very friendly and helpful especially lucia the best i believe she is a future administrator manager of the hotel she was always so really helpful giving us great train connections schedules recommendations i couldn t do better by myself though i am an experienced traveler and always do all preparations very thoroughly the hotel is located near the railway station which gives you the best connection around milano as well as to other places if you have some time to travel within good breakfasts and cozy beds and tea coffee in the room is a great option
