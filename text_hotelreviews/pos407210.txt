convenient location close to the centrale train station made this an ideal hotel for our recent night stay staff were very good and friendly breakfast was not included with our room but we paid the extra as it was far cheaper than what nearby cafes offered we enjoyed a very good meal in the restaurant room was a good size and bathroom was great
