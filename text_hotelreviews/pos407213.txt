close to main station very easy location for day trips to other areas staff were amazing very polite and useful they even brought our bags to our room they answered all questions easily were able to check trains and when they were leaving rooms were clean triple glazed windows you can hear the rumble of the trains but its actually quite peaceful and wasn t loud stops from the city centre by train cost euros each way tip watch out for the helpful girls at the train station ticket machines if they try help avoid machines or tell them no
