this hotel gets the most important thing right the room this deluxe superior room was great value for the money very reasonably priced the room was spacious with practical and pleasing modern streamlined furnishings leaving a good amount of open space for exercise luggage etc the bathroom was likewise large and spacious wifi was good bed comfortable nice in room coffee service with extras included breakfast was more than i was led to believe with good fruits veggies dairy and beautiful pastries for those who like a bit of sweet with their coffee the location has pluses and minuses it s right across the square from the central train station which is convenient for next day travel and on the down side it s next to the train station rather than in a fun urban neighborhood
