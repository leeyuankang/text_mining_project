the hotel is very close to milano central station so you have acces to taxi train metro which is a really good advantage despite the amplacement the hotel is very quiet the room is not very large but quite enough for two adults and one child very clean and cozy good and various breakfast nice staff at the reception and at the breakfast room the hotel has also a small fitness room which made my husband very happy we had a very pleasant vacation
