the cleaning of the room the wi fi service and other facilities but i must ackowledge that the best facility of starhotels anderson for me and my girlfriend was the fact that it is literally beside milan central station allowing us to move easly from milan to other cities by train or even by plane once there is a express train that takes you to the malpensa airport in minutes departuring every hour from the central station for just euros the price of the room was really fair it was a little bit above the cheapests hotels of milan but for the comodity and the confort it worths a lot paying euros for that service that amazing double bed and all those facilities made starhotels anderson reach the top in our experience during our trip
