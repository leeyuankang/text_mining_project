a great hotel right next to the train station which was perfect for our itinerary note that milan centre and the sights are a decent walk or a few metro stops away but easy to get to modern clean rooms and furnishings excellent wifi comfortable bed couldn t ask for much more we belatedly decided to extend our stay by a night and they were able to accommodate us which was very helpful staff were in fact very polite and helpful special mention for the bar who prepared some excellent cocktails
