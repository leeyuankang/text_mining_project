we are a group of pax travelled from rome to milan and arrived early but the staff allowed us to check in without any fuss the check in was super smooth and friendly location of the hotel is really superb only from the station the hotel allowed us to leave most of our baggage after check out just now and hence we can travel light for a night in venice i would definately stay here if ever in milan again
