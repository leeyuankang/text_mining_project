the hotel is very clean and comfortable the location is right across from milan centrale station which has great shopping and access to trains and metro so you can get around easily within milan and to malpensa aiport as well as links to other parts of the country the station itself is a fabulous building to visit outside the station is not fantastic there s a lot of people hanging around but everything else makes up for it there are porters to help you with luggage if needed at the hotel the staff are very good
