location is great convenient to visit the city as well as the nearby lake area by subway or train i booked a room with twin beds and one sofa adult plus two kids of and years old additional euro is charged per night this may be normal in europe but in china no extra charge the room is clean and comfortable big enough the breakfast is good with different choices at euro per person
