great location just by milano centrale train station close to good restaurants the hotel has a classic vibe and the rooms are inspired affairs with above standard bordering on a luxurious feel if you go back to those decades jacuzzi bath and nice little touches such as stationery a mini bar as well as numerous multilingual tv channels we were also able to leave bags at the concierge with no trouble whilst we wondered around the city the following morning close to metro links would definitely stay here again if we re ever back in milan
