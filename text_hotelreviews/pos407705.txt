if you have reason to be very near the train station like an early morning flight or train michaelangelo is a perfect choice after a problem with the a c in my first room the front desk assigned me a new upgraded room without my even asking the wifi is a bit strange being through direct tv you have to keep the tv on but worked fine i had to get up too early for breakfast so can t comment the hotel offered very good value and i would return there again
