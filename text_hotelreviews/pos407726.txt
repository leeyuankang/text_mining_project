super close to the stazione milano centrale which means you can get a bus from linate or a train for malpensa the area around the train station has definitely improved since the last time i was there so it s pleasant to walk around the hotel rooms are spacious and i enjoyed the slippers bathrobes and cosmetics provided they also helped partially reimbursed me for a wrong reservation i made which i appreciate
