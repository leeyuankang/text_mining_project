this hotel biggest selling point for us was the location it is right next to milano centrale and therefore made our trip in and out of the city easily accessible by train with all of our luggage and it made it easy to get to other areas because there is a metro stop inside the train station as well the hotel itself was fine the bathrooms were nice we didn t try the breakfast
