this hotel was in a great location next to milano centrale easy access to from there if you are traveling by train the room was nice not particularly spacious but not too small either the bathroom was really nice it had a spa option for the bath but we didn t use that standard toilet and bidet all in all worth the price and in a great spot with quick access to metro and trains the staff was helpful and spoke english the room was clean
