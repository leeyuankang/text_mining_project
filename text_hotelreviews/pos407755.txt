the staff at the restaurant were just fantastic they were nice helpful and very enthusiastic we must praise alessandra and the rest of the crew sorry i didn t retain their names for making us feel at home as per the hotel facilities they were as usual comfortable and clean it is a bit odd to rely on the tv set for connecting to the internet but that is not a big problem thank you guys very much
