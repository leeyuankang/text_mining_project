the hotel michelangelo in milan is a high rise across the street from the train station and very convenient from that viewpoint which is why i stayed there based on a local recommendation i quite enjoyed my stay from a cultural viewpoint the hotel is modern in an italian modern from forty or fifty years ago sense everything in the room is a gadget to figure out including a pants press the wi fi only works when the tv is turned on the instructions were good the curtains open and shut with electronic button controls sort of a james bond hotel in a word try it you might like it or at least the challenge of some the puzzles as to how to work things like the shower
