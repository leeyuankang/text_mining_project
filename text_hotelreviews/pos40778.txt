near euston station so bus and tube access were excellent parks nearby so it was a lovely area for walking the room was quite small but everything was modern and clean the tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the heated towel rack made for easy hand washing of socks and small items lobby was a great meeting lounge space overall a very nice day stay
