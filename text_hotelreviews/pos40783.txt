fantastic location minute walk from euston train station and mins from kings cross giving great access to the tube and therefore the city centre itself we arrived early and was greeted by smiling faces and helpful staff and we were able to book in early as our room was ready the room was clean the furniture was a little tired but all in all a very comfortable room the afternoon tea in the hotel restaurant twelve was absolutely a maz ing and such good value
