hotel had a beautiful view of central station perfect location to travel anywhere great value for the price the room was beautiful and had all the amenities a traveler could ask for breakfast was great but if you don t like it there are several cafes within walking distance they let you check your bags after your checkout so you an travel all day freely and it is right next to the bus stop for the airport
