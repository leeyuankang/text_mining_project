this hotel has beautiful well appointed rooms that provide you all the comfort you could possibly need the staff were very accommodating and provided us a level of service that was second to none the hotel is in a great location two minutes walk from the train station and about a ten euro taxi ride to the centre of milan we would definitely stay here again a
