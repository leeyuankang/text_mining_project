this hotel was probably the best hotel i stayed at in italy and the facilities could almost be considered luxury the room size was big there was a view of the train station right across the street but it was quiet the breakfast was decent and had quite a bit of variety the staff were helpful when i had a problem the wifi seemed to work well
