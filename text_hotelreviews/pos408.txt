we stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation it has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings would definitely stay there again
