saying it is my new fave is a joke as i have not stayed in milano for years however having picked the mercure for nights after a metro arrival from malpensa after arrival i booked a further nights the accommodation is more than comfortable padded fabric wallcovering made a change i had a room facing the porta venezia and it was quite quiet so no worries there staff were helpful and virtually all spoke english the best bit is the location for going elsewhere ok the metro entry is right in front of the hotel but the best bit is the no tram across the square not only does this go a short way to start at milano centrale but also runs down to porta genova and past the entry points to the navigli canal area which is where i ate every night so for arriving conveniently off a tram easier than maybe stairs in the metro with bags and access to bars and dining it cannot be beat and the period prints decoration is all nice too wifi no issues so all good
