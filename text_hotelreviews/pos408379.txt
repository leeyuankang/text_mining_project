the hotel has a great location right next to the central station you can actually see the cs from the rooms which also provides a nice view the hotel is calm and quiet we could not hear any noise from other rooms nor from outside the rooms are spacious enough maybe on the smaller side but include everything you could need and are very well organized i loved how they left a welcome note from the management and a cookie rooms come with great beds very comfy so it s really a great place to get a good night sleep when traveling the bathrooms are well equipped everything worked perfectly nice shower good and very clean towels soap etc included the whole hotel and the rooms are extremely clean they pay special attention to little details everywhere which was highly appreciated and made our stay more special the staff is incredible thanks to all who have booked restaurants and taxis for us given us advice and offered help well beyond their jobs i ve notices comments complaining about the stairs at the entrance of the hotel there was always someone there to help us carry all of our luggage and they were also extremely friendly all the time the hotel has many lifts and they rarely get crowded the breakfast is good beyond average with something for everyone you can find interesting things and combinations special mention has to be given to the muesli station well done in the evenings they have cocktail hours with free appetizers in the lobby bar definitely a hotel where i plan to return for another holiday
