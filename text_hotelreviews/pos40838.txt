location is excellent just a few minutes walk to both euston and kings cross as well as st pancras international and their excellent transport links rooms are pretty average but a decent size for a london hotel very clean a decent shower which is essential and the nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch overall a good stay and i would recommend to anyone who may be travelling to or from the above mentioned stations
