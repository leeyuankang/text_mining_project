the fact that the hotel is right in front of the central train station is the best thing it is very very nice and staff are very friendly and helpful reception downstairs always helped us with the necessary it has a very nice comfortable relaxing lounge area a bit expensive to buy your drinks from there but overall it was great and convenient would book again
