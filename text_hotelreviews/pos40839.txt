near to euston and kings cross stations the rooms were small but had everything we needed everything was clean and the basic facilities like hairdryer flat screen tv nespresso machine etc were all there we didn t eat in the restaurant so i can t comment about the food thre is a small cafe area which isn t luxurious but is fine to while away an hour waiting for your train
