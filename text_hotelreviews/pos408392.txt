avant garde i loved every single thing about this hotel we stayed there for only one night but it would take me a whole page to describe it the best lounging spaces ever fatboys laying on the grass at night to hang out with your drink two amazing terraces classy restaurant a super modern bar with rocking chairs and design couches the bed was oh so comfortable and the buffet breakfast was unforgetable and this is difficult because i try to go gluten free which is usually a nightmare in italy what really worked perfectly for us was the location just across the street from the train station milano centrale you arrive with the train and don t even need a taxi them from there you take the subway to go to the cathedral and all the shopping mecca s in milan and also from the same station you catch the train to the airport no taxis no hustle
