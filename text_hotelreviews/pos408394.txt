me and my friend who are both students stayed here for night the hotel is nice clean and modern it offers good facilities great breakfast and decent rooms me and my friend got back to our room late after a long night in the city this is when we noticed that our air con did not work along with the heat our room was also placed close to the ground facing the central station this meant that all the trams that went past the hotel would make extremely loud noises as well as give a shaking sensation to our room which made it hard to sleep we would have asked for a new room if we would have noticed these flaws earlier but decided to just go with it and try to catch some sleep
