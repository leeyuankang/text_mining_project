a package was delivered to the hotel for me a day or two before i arrived with clear instructions to hold the package for me however someone on the staff received the package but did not follow instructions to hold the package for my arrival instead he sent the package back to the sender and i never received the package i was disappointed that the hotel was not able to follow simple instructions i expected better from this hotel
