overall great price for central london some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really not impeccably clean but not what i d call dirty either windows could use a cleaning room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central london staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until is great considering every other pub closes at or midnight plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the picadilly line is one block away i stayed here nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price i paid
