the decor of the hotel is stunning modern boutique hotel with an eclectic range of vintage decorations stepping inside the lobby is like walking into a furniture shop great place to unwind with a night cap as an alternative to the bar scene rooms are spacious and clean with all the mod cons staff are warm and friendly the closest metro station was a good minutes on foot but the tram stop is just up the street with a couple of lines going directly to the duomo the hotel is not the easiest to find i walked straight past it looking for signage it s behind heavy black metal gates breakfast is nothing to write home about you get brought a set range of pastries museli yoghurt and juice anything else can be ordered a la carte at an additional cost great roman restaurant a few minutes from hotel cacio e pepe which has fantastic authentic carbonara
