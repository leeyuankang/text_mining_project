probably the nicest hotel experience i have had in europe to day even better than a few i have been hosted by given the absolutely embracing and unique environment crafted with wit and heart the impeccable guest service blending international professionalism standards and genuine italian hospitality and the strategic position in the heart of the city full grades for a great job with creating a classy and yet warm nest in the city centre looking forward to going back
