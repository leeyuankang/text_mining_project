for mid income travellers the hotel probably is one of the best boutique hotel in europe for both leisure and business trips and interesting i would like to add it is a living retro museum for guests absolutely not kitsch in evenings we had have no desire to leave it so comfortable and artistic the lobby is a lot of good art and design albums at any place there relaxing lightening a nice non clamant music from the bar friendly naturally nice staff people
