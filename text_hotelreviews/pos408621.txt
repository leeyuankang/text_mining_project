simply an amazing place to stay where do i begin from the staff was exceptional very professiona friendly and above all so helpful the hotel was one of the beat we have ever visited with a very elegant decoration the breakfast was the only thing i would like to have more options of but everything else was so perfect that this was a mere detail the location was the best to stay at in milan although a minute walk to the metro we will definetely be back oh and the owner is such a beautiful stylish woman who even kissed us goodbye we felt home away from home
