the concierge was really helpful made our stay very comfortable he knew what the recommended ways of travel and explained the ticket procedures for trams and trains for all the sites we tried to see we had earlier been advised to not use taxis because of their gross charges this was our first time in amsterdam and holland the restaurant on the first floor was also very good excellent meals and service
