the main reason why i chose to stay at this hotel was mainly because it was the selected venue for our conference so it made sense to stay at the same hotel what i realised later on is that it was a waste of money this hotel is rated stars where i would personally rate them or at most stars i honestly wish i have gone with another hotel that is closer to city than this hotel the swiss brand is not reflected on this hotel at all i had the executive double room which was on the top floors yet it was so small and normal it didn t reflect any executive feeling at all i ve checked out the other rooms and they are the exact same except the other room doesn t have access to what they call the executive lounge which to be honest is not worth it as they have nothing to offer in that lounge they had kind of belgium wine on the happy hour and some nibbles finger food which is not that good at all the service at the lounge is so bad you feel like it s some kind of scam if you think of the amount of money you are paying for such service room when it comes to the room again the room decore is very basic and looks like they had that formica covered fake wood which made things look so cheap and very ugly the bedside tables had no drawers there is just no enough storage space in that room which is ironic as the swiss are known to have very good designs that is functional and smart yet this hotel represent the opposite the bathroom was not smart either the shower water pressure is very low you feel like you are in a world country they only provide shower gel and shampoo nothing more than that which is strange for an executive room i would have expected they would provide a toothbrush and some more toiletries such as little perfume or even proper organic hand wash or even s loofah or a shaving kit like any normal start at the end you feel like you are not getting your money s worth
