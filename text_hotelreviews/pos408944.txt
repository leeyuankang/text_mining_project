i have experienced many star hotels in many countries i can honestly say that m venpick amsterdam is one of the top hotels in which i have stayed for once i was not on a business trip but on a citytrip with my wife the room was great the location is fabulous and the restaurant is very nice but above all the staff and atmosphere in the hotel give you a warm welcoming feeling almost like coming home this is something i have not exeperienced in many hotels except for the w hotel chain m venpick is up there right with the best of the best
