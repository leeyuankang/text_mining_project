we had a superior room on floor with a city view one of the best views in town it has a great location min walking to city center near from everything just under the hotel you can rent a bike the mini bar is for free everyday they get you free bottles of water and everything you take from the minibar the staff is nice there is a free shuttle to the central train station which is min walking away i would definitely go back to this hotel especially at the same room we had
