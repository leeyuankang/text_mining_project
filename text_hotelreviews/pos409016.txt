no complaints whatever lovely views spacious clean new looking comfortable room adequate lighting great breakfast buffet there is a free hotel shuttle to central station but there is also a tram stop right across from the hotel min walk enabling more flexibility and later return times the hotel is not actually in the center of things but with an unlimited ticket for public transportation highly recommended it is incredibly easy to get to wherever you want to go in minutes and without any confusion
