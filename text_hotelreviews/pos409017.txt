we had a wonderful two day stay at this hotel before a celebrity baltic cruise we were able to walk our luggage down the block and drop it off at the cruise terminal the morning of our departure the hotel was beautiful and clean our room was very nice with a comfy bed and stunning water views we had dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night since we were tired from traveling and that was very nice too
