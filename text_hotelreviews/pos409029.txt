the hotel was excellent while not in the very center of amsterdam we found this to be an advantage because we didn t have to be in constant crowds it s only one tram stop away from central station and also an easy minute walk the staff was wonderful and the included breakfast buffet well worth the money the concierge very helpful with tours tickets vouchers etc also near the library where my husband wanted to do some research we booked a junior suite with a stunning view
