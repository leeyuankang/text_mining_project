location it is just a minute walk to the central station and along the canal views from the room are outstanding overlooking the river and motorway great effect at night too rooms we stayed in the family room with interconnecting doors very comfortable beds and great for a family of breakfast worth dying for you are spoilt for choices staff extremely polite and helpful great work ethic transport free shuttle every mins to central in case you don t want to walk solves the problem of the location being slightly away from the center
