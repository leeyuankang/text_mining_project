excellent staff we stayed nights we booked specifically a double bed room but got twin beds we asked to change when we arrive but the hotel was full but we have been able to change the room for a double bed for the second and the rest of the stay very comfy and clean shuttle service to central station was helpful too there is also a bike rental company in the parking just below the hotel
