we travelled to amsterdam to meet with family who were docked at the pier so this was a really good location for that the room had everything we needed and was warm comfortable and clean the concierge helped us greatly with regard to navigating the city on the first day we ventured out and sold us tickets for the van gogh museum as well which we found extremely helpful
