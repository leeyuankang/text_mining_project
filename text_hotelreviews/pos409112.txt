the hotel is in a good location one tram stop from the central station rooms are very trendy however what i appreciated the most is the staff flexibility and approach to the guests they are very at tentative to any concern you might have we faced an issue and the hotel manager and front office manager were very accommodating it s a hotel that really cares about maintaining it s brand name and reputation i definitely recommend and will come back to again
