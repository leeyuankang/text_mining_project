the hotel is beautiful contemporary and comfortable it s a bit out of the way requiring a ride on the tram to get into the city of amsterdam it is close to the port where we boarded for a river boat cruise if the cruise is your main objective and you re looking for an overnight the hotel is great if you re there to tour the city i d recommend a hotel in town
