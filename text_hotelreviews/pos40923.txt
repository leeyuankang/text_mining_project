excellent location just a few minutes walk from euston station room was a decent size and very clean nice compact bathroom option to leave luggage after checkout if you are out and about which is handy we didn t try the restaurant although the menu sounded good and it looked as though it would be nice checkout isn t until midday as well which was great most places seem to make you leave by or so we were impressed with that
