nice hotel in a great location walk from the euston station good for a short london stay with good tube and train connections from euston polite and helpful staff rooms are clean and nicely furnished but rather small with pod style bathrooms so would not recommend for longer stay but definitely fine for a few days enjoyed my stay there
