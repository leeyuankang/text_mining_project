amazing location especially handy if you are new to barcelona and wanting to be close to everything and get your bearings quickly staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly hotel isn t as modern as some people may like but if you re going to barcelona why would you want to be in the hotel all the time comfy beds and our room was upgraded on arrival i would definitely return
