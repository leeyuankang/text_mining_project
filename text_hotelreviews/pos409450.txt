this hotel was recommended to us for its location the staff were excellent and quick to put things right ie when lights went out maintenance arrived speedily the lobby bar smelt and looked good i believe the hotel has already began refurbishing rooms once all rooms have had a make over i am sure this hotel will be in much demand very courteous staff
