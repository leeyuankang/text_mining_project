the hotel is in a fantastic location less than minutes walk from the plaza catalunya and just metres away from las ramblas yet still quiet inside the public areas of the hotel were modern and stylish but the guest bedrooms were a little dated but perfectly adequate staff were very pleasant and eager to help it wasn t warm enough to use the swimming pool during my visit but would envisage it being great during the summer would happily recommend the hotel and would certainly stay there again
