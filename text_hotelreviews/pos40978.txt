i liked the area as it is very near to russell square and the tube is very near there are also plenty of buses and a lot of eating places in the vicinity the brunswick shopping centre is close by the staff were polite and helpful i liked having a kettle in the room and tea and coffee and complimentary water the room was cleaned every day and the tea etc was replenished
