great location min walk to the beach and min walk to the center the room is new but very tiny so is the bed there was no space to put the suitcases why would someone need a kitchen in this full of restaurants and cafes area we had nice view over the harbour the staff at reception is vey friendly and helppfull our low rating is due to value for money issue not worth eu per night in general we enoiyed our stay
