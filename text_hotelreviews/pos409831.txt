we stayed nights at the end of may in the suite on the floor facing the street with the view of the harbor we were a little concerned about the noise at first but it was no bother the room was very nice and spacious we did not use the kitchenette much but it was well equipped hotel staff was very friendly and helpful excellent location we were able to walk to the beach and many shops and restaurants in the gothic quarter all together it was a pleasant stay i would definitely recommend duquesa suites to anyone traveling to barcelona
