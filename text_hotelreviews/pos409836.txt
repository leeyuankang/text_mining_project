the staff is very friendly and helpful the apartment clean the only problem was with the air conditioning i tried many times to get them to correct a problem with the air conditionner dont know if its only room that the air conditionner doesn t work properly every time they would come up to the room and of course some cool air would always be venting but not efficiently yet in the hallways it was freezing low and behold since this review i am sure the problem has been found
