for customers who want a large formal lobby this is not the hotel for you however the rooms are very nice larger than the norm in this section of city and the hotel is in the middle of the very old section of town where there are numerous bars and restaurants within easy walking distance the reception desk service to facilitate check in print boarding pass reserve taxi etc was great
