we loved everything about this small but wonderful hotel the staff were so friendly accommodating and helpful the location was perfect for walking all over the many great areas of downtown and old city barcelona the views from the rooftop solarium were gorgeous we could have spent more time simply relaxing up there and we had plenty of room for a family of and it was clean and comfortable with great amenities we didn t want to leave we will be back
