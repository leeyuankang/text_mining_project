a fantastic place to stay lovely location right by the marina the staff were great they made us feel really welcome and were always happy to help the room was really good spacious and modern with our own kitchenette but best of all was the rooftop overlooking the port we would recommend dequesa suites to anyone and will definitely be staying here again
