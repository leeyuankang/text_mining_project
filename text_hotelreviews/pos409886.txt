we had a corner suite which had a lovely high ceiling and loads of light the young man on reception was utterly charming and helpful and kind when i broke my ankle we slept well due to excellent soundproofing despite the noisy location it was clean comfortable and spacious and a tremendous view from the roof the kitchen is fully equipped and the furniture was all in good shape we would happily stay there again
