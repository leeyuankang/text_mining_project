location was excellent great for the barri gotic area and the marina the corner suite was roomy modern and clean very comfortable the staff were all very friendly and helpful the rooftop pool and sunbathing area was great in the barcelona heat and had great views of the marina we travelled as a family of four and i would recommend the duquesa suites to anyone
