this place was perfect for our stay in barcelona such nice modern rooms everything was super clean and the staff was very friendly we had an interior room so we didn t have a view but we were always up on the roof deck anyways the roof deck is so nice and you have a beautiful view of the marina we were up there every night of our three day stay the location was really nice only a minute walk to la rambla we were also really close to the stops for both loops of the hop on hop off bus would definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to barcelona
