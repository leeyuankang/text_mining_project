this is a gem of a hotel in just right spot in barcelona on the edge of the ciutat gotico and within walking distance of the born district placa cataluyna the ports beaches and barceloneta fishing village great for families with kids had a kitchenette and we had a room with large bed and nice sofa style second bed instead of being crowded by a third bed boutique style with helpful staff and lovely rooftop pool for cooling off with great historic views of the city after a hot day of seeing the sights couldnt imagine a better location from which to see barcelona
