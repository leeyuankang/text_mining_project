i stayed here for nights with my mother and my daughter in early june we stayed in a superior suite and it was perfect with very comfy beds there was all the equipment you would need to prepare your own meals but we ate out each evening they also supplied champagne flutes which was an added bonus to have a glass of prosecco on the roof top terrace staff were very helpful and would stay here again as location was ideal
