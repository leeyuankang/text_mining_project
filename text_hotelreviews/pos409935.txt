we had so much fun here the staff are so kind and helpful the kitchen facilities are really nice and well stocked the beds and pillows are very comfortable the wifi was really fast the rooftop pool was the best part it is shallow and my kid loved it and we spent a lot of time up there the view from the hotel is beautiful and the hotel is in a great location we could walk to the beach restaurants and the tour bus stops and there is a supermarket a few steps from downstairs
