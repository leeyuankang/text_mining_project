breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory plenty of choices for all bed was very comfortable bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water location could not have been better very short walk to underground beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel very quiet in spite of being close to earl s court rd staff was friendly and helpful everyone was very easy to deal with
