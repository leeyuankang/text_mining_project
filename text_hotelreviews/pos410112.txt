the hotel was strategically located within a short walking distance to the conference centre where my congress was making it convenient for me to walk to and fro each day there was a tram stop directly in front of the hotel and a metro station a little farther away this made exploring the city very easy for my husband and son who had accompanied me on the trip the natural history museum which was just next to the conference centre and the beach a little beyond the centre were also firm favourites with them there was a shopping mall with eateries and popular brands within walking distance too during their walkabouts my husband and son discovered several halal eateries one was in the shopping mall while there were at least others in the vicinity of the hotel these restaurants sold mainly middle eastern food such as kebab and biryani and were reasonably priced breakfast was good with an exciting array of food to choose from
