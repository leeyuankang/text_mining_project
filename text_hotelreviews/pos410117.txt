the staff was very friendly and helpful special thanks to bianca in the reception she did everything to help from check in to arranging a transfer to the airport at check out the location is excellent in a quite neighborhood but with access to all public transportation at walking distance including bus metro and tram which made moving to downtown rambella and port very easy also the proximity to diagonal mar shopping mall made shopping an amusement at the end of everyday
