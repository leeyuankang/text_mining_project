the facilities were perfect the pool and the spa especially the floor lounge the rooms are really comfortable there s a tram that stops right outside the hotel and the tube stop is to the side the barcelona bus tour stops right next to the hotel too so great location it is about min from the main town centre there is also a taxi rank right outside and a shopping centre
