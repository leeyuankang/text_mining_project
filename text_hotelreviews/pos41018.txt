trip to hotel was upgraded from single to double when explained about noise from other guests on my first stay the receptionist was very helpful and accommodating and found a quiet room clean tidy and a really comfortable bed wi fi was fast enough for normal purposes and plenty tea coffee etc would liked to have stayed another night though the lack of wardrobe space would have been difficult even tho the double was cheaper than the single very convenient for eurostar etc
