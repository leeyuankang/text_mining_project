fantastic hotel we stayed in a suite with a jacuzzi the most relaxing and comfortable nights sleep i have had in a long time the room was immaculate and the view out of the floor to ceiling windows was fabulous the staff and facilities are second to none and they are pet friendly so made our stay even easier i have no doubt that we will return to this hotel
