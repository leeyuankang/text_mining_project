good transport connections and many of the tourist attractions were in easy walking distance we did not have breakfast in the hotel as there was a little cafe round the corner that did beautiful smoked salmon and scrambled egg on toast with a coffee or tea for hotel was very clean i had a single room which was rather small but had all the amenities including a nespresso machine
