we had a jacuzzi suite and it was lovely the staff were brilliant for us the location was perfect near the beach and metro service right outside which took you to pretty much everywhere in barcelona the bed was very comfortable it was my birthday on one of the days and they sent a card to my room which had been signed by all the staff with a bottle of prosecco which was lovely the room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels and bedding and the barmans specialty cocktails have to be the best cocktails i ve ever had love this place and will be returning x
