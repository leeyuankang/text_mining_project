we booked a room with a hot tub and was not disappointed we had a large room with everything you would require for a comfortable stay the hot tub was very relaxing and with a bottle of cava free from the mini bar made it even better staff greeted us straight away and made us feel very welcome we are certainly coming back to this hotel
