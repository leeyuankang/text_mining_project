i loved that it is located just a few minutes away from the beach we walked with our dog all the way approx from the hotel to the city along the beach and it was wonderful a lot to see and very beautiful walk the hotel itself is situated beside a shopping center at the end of the diagonal road easy access also to supermarkets to buy water and food for our trip back home in the car hotel is easily to find with our car and with a good underground parking garage per day it is not a five star hotel obviously but ok for the price and we are convinced and we will book it definitely again the next time in barcelona
