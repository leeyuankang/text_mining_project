i really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel the staff is wonderful accommodations quite comfortable the electronic control panel for lights and temperature is a little tricky to figure out but once you know the secret there aren t any issues the pricing on spa services was very reasonable in my opinion the location is great if you are there for a conference at the ccib as it is directly across the street and diagonal mar a large shopping mall is also across the street there are quite a few quick eateries in the area as well and it s just a quick walk to some of the beaches you will need to take the metro or tram both stops close by or a taxi to downtown and to go sightseeing however
