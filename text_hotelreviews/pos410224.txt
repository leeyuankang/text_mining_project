i traveled with my little boy the hotel staff were extremely accommodating with all of our needs including allowing us to use the hotel freezer for storing some of his baby food the room included a microwave and a fridge which again is very good when you have a child with you overall it is a very good hotel and fantastic value for money everything is so near by the public transport is easy to use and you can reach the center of the city within minutes by metro
