the hotel is in a great location with a shopping centre just mins walk away lots of restaurants to choose from in tbe shopping centres we didnt eat at the hotel at all not even breakfast as great bakery round the corner where we bought our breakfast and lunch for the day for under for both of us the spa was good we got one days access included in the stay and also we booked a tibeten hot stone massage which was exellent and highly recommend the room was very clean and comfortable with all your mod cons and free wifi l would stay here again
