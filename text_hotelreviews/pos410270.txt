we chose this hotel as it was within our budget and it was important for us to be near public transport links to get around the city this meant that we were located outside the city centre and tourist area to some degree but this did not impact negatively on our holiday our room was impeccably clean very spacious and the facilities were perfect there was a safe which we believe to be essential when travelling free wifi was also important for us and having a microwave in addition to the mini bar was a nice bonus the walk in shower was great although a nonslip mat would have made it feel safer there was a separate toilet and bidet as well as complimentary toiletries and extras such as disposable razors were a nice addition the staff were friendly and helpful and indulged our attempts to communicate with them in spanish with good humour and their english was a welcome relief when we struggled s little we only had bar snacks and chose not to use the restaurant as we wanted to sample the local eateries instead we visited in october so didn t use the swimming pool or open decking area but would have in perhaps slightly warmer weatheras it looked fabulous we would definitely stay here again if we visit barcelona again
