it is interesting location will never guess that barcelona could be so modern and with such a high tech buildings if stay somewhere closer to center big shopping center nearby with a lot of cafe restaurants opened till late night so you never have a problem where to get something to eat also you can get it in hotel directely sea beach is quite close so if you like you can get there times a day at mornings and evenings while day time is for city center
