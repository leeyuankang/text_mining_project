the hotel is very modern and looks good the rooftop pool is very nice and the view fantastic the hotel ist next to a metro station so you can reach rambla etc very easily the stuff is friendly the rooms are clean nothing bad to say there the only strange thing is that you need to pay at the beginning of the staying not at the end of the staying they accept cash and card i paid by cash the room includes everything you need the view is great the hotel gym was great one of the best gyms i have ever seen in a hotel
