the hotel was extremely futuristic from a design perspective and had very fancy electrical fittings the decor was nice the location was pretty central beside the large mall and close to the big bus bustop and the breakfast has to be the best one can offer at that price it was a massive spread and really value for money the staff were pretty helpful as well and there were loads of little convenience stores around to get basic necessities the view from the swimming pool on the top floor was marvellous and the entire takeaway from our night stay at this hotel was positive
