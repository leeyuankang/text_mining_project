good things the hotel is nice and modern the rooms are modern and comfortable the staff are quiet helpful and even upgraded our room to an executive room free of charge when we asked for a sea view executive rooms allow free access to the spa and the roof terrace bar you see in the photos unfortunately if you do not have an upgraded room you cannot go to the roof top bar this is a shame as it is almost deserted up there so if you like an atmosphere it s definely not the place you d want to spend an evening but the views are amazing and it has a free help yourself bar yes as much beers wine and spirits as you want the spa is fairly good for a hotel a lot of the reviews will tell you about a large mall very close to the hotel the food court is fantastic it s indoor and out door the outdoor part is really nice and there is an italian restaurant there that is really really good you must go for dinner there if you stay here
