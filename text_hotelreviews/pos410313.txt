the room was large it had a working desk a comfortable bed and a range of pillows to choose from despite difficulties operating the air conditioning i can recommend the hotel as it also has good metro and tram connections to city center the pool on the top floor was small but nice with a good view the hotel is also circa minute walk from the beach and next to the natural history museum and a large shopping center
