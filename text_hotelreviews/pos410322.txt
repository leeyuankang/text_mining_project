the location of the hotel is very good we rented a car and the hotel offered the parking at extra cost euros day due to being booked through booking com otherwise if you go directly through their website is free on the plus side if you book through this website you get a big discount on the spa facilities you get a bar at the ground floor opened until you have a pool on floor and also if you book a suite you get access to the floor vip terrace the rooms are very tidy and cleaned everyday clean towels are provided daily also though it usually happens around if you arent planing to rent a car there is a taxi station just in front plus buses and trams as well have the station in front of the hotel very nice stuff and helpfull although i imagine they have to put with a lot on a daily basis i would encourage you to book a bed and breakfast and no more then that reason being the breakfast is fabulous with lots of food to chose from and is really worth it otherwise is per day im very happy with my choice the waiters from the bar downstairs are great big thanks to jordi one of them try the eclipse bar at the w hotel the view from the floor is amazing
