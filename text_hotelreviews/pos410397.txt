i love this hotel so much we come every year for the primavera sound festival and whilst the hotel is more expensive than we would normally accept we think it is worth every penny the staff are always excellent the pool terrace is one of the best i ve previously used other hotels in the city the rooms beautiful and the breakfast incredible
