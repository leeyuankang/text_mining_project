the staff was amazing there was nothing too much trouble for them we had an early check in we just wanted to leave our bags behind us but the men at reception offered a ready room the receptionist young spanish guy with glasses unfortunately i can t remember his name was the best so far you have to know i working in a star hotel in london but i wish i had his colleauge just so naturally kind and polite his knowledge about guest service and about the city is highlighted the room is fully equipped the location is brilliant just minutes walk from the beach just hard to say negative about the hotel yeah the lift so many times just stopped to work wich was fixed within minutes so who cares definitely will be my choice in autumn when i return back to the city
