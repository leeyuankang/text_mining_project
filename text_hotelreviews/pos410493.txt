clean friendly and comfortable hotel we went for a bit of luxury and certainly felt pampered well worth paying for a suite the jacuzzi in our room was amazing there was no kettle as other reviews have stated but i only had to ask at the bar and they gave me one for the room location is a long way from barcelona central but easily accessed by taxi or public transport with a huge shopping centre opposite hotel plenty of little bars along the street and the beach a min walk away we didn t feel the need to go anywhere great place for days of pampering floor lounge an unexpected bonus personally i found the spa clean and well enough equipped and the staff were great
