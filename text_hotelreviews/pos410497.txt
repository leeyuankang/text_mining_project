the breakfast was superb however if you didn t want to pay pp pn you could always go to the supermarket or caf s in the shopping centre or near the metro station the rooms were nice but maintenance is a little slow we had a broken shower tray and doorstop not massive issues but when you have a one year old these things are hazards gym is well equipped and always seemed empty although you have to pay extra to use the spa surely if you re a guest of the hotel then you should get full access the location is perfect near the beach a large shopping centre with loads of restaurants and caf s on the terrace it s only a min walk from the metro station where you can get to the centre of barcelona in mins that being said the hilton and marriott etc are equally as well located
