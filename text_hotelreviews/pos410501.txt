my room was very clean and comfortable there was a good desk and work space the bar and restaurant had great staff and quality the location wasn t perfect but definitley not bad there was a tram stop right in front of the hotel that could take you down to port olimpic which was where most tourist go there is a beach in walking distance from the hotel but it is kind of small
