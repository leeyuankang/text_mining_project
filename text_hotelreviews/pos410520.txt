very modern business hotel located in opposite of the ccib close to restaurants bars a big shopping centre and the beach directly at the hotel there is a tram stop the hotel service was very friendly the room was absolutely tidy and comfortable the gym was perfect too with everything you need for a good work out but for early birds it could open earlier than for a next stop in barcelona i will book this hotel again
