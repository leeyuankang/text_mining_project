the staff were always pleasant communicated well and very willing to help with our needs giving directions taxi etc the experience was memorable from the moment we checked in and received a welcome drink our room was ready early as i had informed the hotel of our arrival time but did not request an early check in so that was wonderful we definitely took advantage of all the facilities the rooftop is just perfect to escape the mayhem in the pla a reial we loved it so much we had dinner at la terraza del do twice during our stay
