this is one of those very special hotels that makes you feel so at home so comfortable and well taken care of that you actually think about planning another visit to the city just so you can stay here again although they have just rooms this hotel doesn t feel cramped or small the high ceilings and huge windows make it seem like a much larger space yet with a sense of calm and intimacy that will sooth any weary traveller they even have a small rooftop pool don t expect much it s tiny but hey you re in the city in an historic building a bar at the top with gorgeous views and a spa with massage and facial services the hotel is located in an old historic building and rooms have beautiful hardwood floors and the original ceiling beams and details but the hotel is just four years old so everything was refurbished and renovated and very clean and luxurious the bathrooms are wonderful double sinks great lighting a detail so important and yet so often overlooked in hotels a full bathtub and a full separate shower stall commode with its own full door so more than one person can use the bathroom at the same time molton brown toiletries huge thick and soft monogrammed towels and a heated towel rack in the room the beds are terrific and they even have a pillow menu so you can choose the sort of pillow you want and a room scent menu as well drinks in the minibar are all complimentary so you can refresh yourself without spending a fortune and a sign of the exceptional service was shown when i left the room and came back in the evening to find that the exact same drinks i had consumed that afternoon has been restocked the hotel has an excellent location right off the las ramblas pedestrian mall and just steps away and overlooking the beautiful and popular pla a reial i just wish that more hotels would be like the do and offer such fantastic facilities and service
