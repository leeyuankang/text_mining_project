breakfast is amazing food here in general is really good should come here even for lunch or dinner especially on the terrat friendly staff and always there for any request you may have a beautifully decorated hotel from the terrat down to the rooms and in the restaurant in the basement a pearl of a hotel amongst the busy and crowded pla a and neighboring streets and avenues location is everything and this hotel is at a very prime location i will definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to barcelona
