comfortable newly refurbished rooms excellent location for the beach the gym facilities are great very well maintained with a lot of equipment the lower pool area is nice for sitting in the sun and relaxing the upper pool area does not receive much sunlight in the afternoon as the hotel blocks the sunlight a good selection of food is served in the outside area the wet deck parties on sunday evenings are quite lively free for guests i will book again next year
