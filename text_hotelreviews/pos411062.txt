the w is a great hotel the sea views from the sky room were superb as was the shower no sunset view but nonetheless enjoyable the hotel is right on the beachfront so is a great location in close proximity to restaurants and bars the infinity pool was great a much more relaxing environment than the larger pool sunday nights during summer hold a wet deck party and that seems like the place to be breakfast was expensive for what it was but adequate the hotel gym is probably the best hotel gym is used
