the staff were superb from arranging restaurant reservations sorting a champagne breakfast for our first day down to providing an umbrella at the first site of a cloud the staff were attentive and quick to respond to all our requests a complimentary upgrade to the suite was also a fantastic touch as it was my girlfriends birthday the views from the rooms are amazing and the eclipse bar is a must
