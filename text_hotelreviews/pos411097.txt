we had both dinner and breakfast at bravo and we both times disappointed the dinner was not good value for money considering it s fine dinning and breakfast was slow and food that ran out was never replaced most disappointing food of our honeymoon however the rest of the hotel was absolutely excellent especially the wet area staff and service and cleanliness very impressed and also a big thankyou to the staff at the front desk and eclipse bar made our honeymoon worth while
