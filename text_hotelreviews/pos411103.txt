arrived at check in is at room was not ready were told that the room would be ready in minutes and that we would be called after an hour no call so went to check then waited another for the room then the room cool corner suit had an obstructed view most of the view was the roof of another building the room wasn t cleaned the next day so we had to call reception and only then did they come and clean it whatsapp service that was offered for service was bad used it once and didn t get a reply for over an hour room service did not bring all the requested items overall disappointing for a star hotel at this price
