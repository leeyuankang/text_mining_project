the hotel is stunning inside and out the standard is impeccably high we were a group of of us stayed on the floor wonderful room and on the floor cosy room both were equally as luxurious with the only difference being the wonderful room was slightly larger with a full view the view on the floor was visible so still great i would definitely stay again
