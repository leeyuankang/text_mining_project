i couldn t speak more highly of this hotel the view from the fantastic room facing the beach and city was out of this world and the bed was super comfortable the service we received was some of the best i ve ever experienced staff were always friendly and attentive the facilities were great we really loved the wet deck especially the sundaze party that was held there on sunday night we would definitely stay there again and will highly recommend it to anyone else
