everything was just perfect it was definitely worth the money the staff couldn t do enough for you the location was amazing too both meals in the wave restaurant on my birthday and in the salt restaurant were lovely the waiters were very attentive pool attendants and pool bar staff were also amazing they seemed to work long hard hours but never tired of offering help or smiles especially the lovely pool man on the roof top pool bar
