the location was great since there are only a couple of high end hotels on the beach if you like to get exercise this is the perfect place to run and the gym at the w was above your average hotel gym the rooms were spacious the view was great the showers had hot water and water pressure the mini bar was also complete with what you would need to make your own drinks if necessary the prices on the menu were reasonable in comparison to some other hotels at this level the staff at the bravo restaurant was very friendly
