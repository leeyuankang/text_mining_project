beds were awesome rooms were spacious with great views whether on the or floor we stayed twice at the beginning and end of our cruise breakfast was a little spendy for light eaters and drinkers but the food was really great especially orders off the menu and staff was uber pleasant and attentive everyone and we mean everyone went out of their way to make sure we knew where we were going and had everything we needed we would definitely book again
