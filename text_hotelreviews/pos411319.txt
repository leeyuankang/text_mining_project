fantastic place we were there for nights and found the staff to be super friendly and will to cater your every need the food we had round the pool was exceptional with the tuna salad coming up top for me drinks prices round the pool are slightly higher than the norm but not too high that you feel you have to hold back i think a beer was there is a short walk to the main restaurant area of barca but it s a lovely one along the promenade would i go again oh yes
