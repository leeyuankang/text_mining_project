we travelled to barcelona as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary we arrived in our room to a bottle of champagne and chocolates and a lovely letter from the hotel wishing us a happy anniversary the staff could not do enough for us they even called one day asking if we required any more complimentary water or pods for the coffee machine we had asked for a room overlooking the front of the hotel to add to our experience of our first time in barcelona to get a feel for the buzz and not to be looking into other accommodation or other buildings as we were aware the blocks are in a square formation this was what we got lovely experience all in
