we chose this hotel for a week in barcelona to celebrate my wife s anniversary we both agree it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in our room had a balcony with a view of plaza urquinaona the entire hotel looks and feels brand new the architect did a really good job turning an old building into a modern star hotel the position is great for visiting all of barcelona except park guell on foot we first planned to get the city tour but didn t have to since everything was within walking distance from the hotel get the breakfast it may seem expensive at but trust me it s well worth it great variety with different stuff every day their chef makes the best poached eggs i have ever eaten got them every morning they also have lots of fresh fruits i especially loved the pineapple bonus points for the roof terrace it s a great place to chill for half an hour in the evening before going to your room also good if you like sunbathing we don t we did love the small pool however though it feels more like a jacuzzi then an actual pool if i had to choose my favourite thing about the hotel it would definetly be the staff they are really nice and went out of their way to make sure we enjoy our stay we got complimentary bottles of champagne from them during our stay one as an apology for a problem with the keycards that was fixed the next day another one for my wife s birthday and a third one just wishing us a pleasant stay
