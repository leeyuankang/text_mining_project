the beds where really comfortable i liked the balcony with armchair and additional blanket for the chilly nights as well the shower was huge and with a big showerhead the coffee machine was a wonderful plus and then there was always a bottle of water very useful and comfortable the super soft sponge bathrobe and the sponge slippers the position of the hotel was really good right in front of urquinaona metro just across the street and in minutes walk you are in barrio gothic there are some nice touches arond the hotel like always a very good scent in the hall and some yummy candy jars around forgot to tell when you check in they offer you some drinks the hotel bar has a nice outdoor area in a green courtyard last but not least the reception staff was excellent
