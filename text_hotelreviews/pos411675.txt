my stay in barcelona exceeded all of my expectations from start to finish the hotel was excellent especially as it was so centrally located and wonderfully designed almost everywhere could be reached on foot the hotel staff were extremely obliging as nothing was too much trouble for them and they provided lots of information regarding the places of interest in the city i would certainly recommend using the city tour buses as they provide good value for money the one ticket can be used on both routes being east and west therefore taking in many many sights that could not be reached on foot as a tip to tourists use the blue autobus service to and from the airport and buy a return ticket as it is just over euros per person and the travelling time is only minutes approximately why waste money on taxis when you could be spending it on all that wonderful cuisine
