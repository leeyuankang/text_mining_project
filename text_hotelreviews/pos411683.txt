perfect hotel great rituals toiletries in the room and we were given a bottle of cava and chocolates because we were there celebrating my partner s birthday the location is perfect for exploring barcelona on foot and was very quiet at night despite it s central location staff were really helpful throughout our stay wouldn t change a thing
