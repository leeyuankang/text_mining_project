the staff at the reception and entrance are all very helpful with all our queries they are super attentive to us on the epiphany day they even went an extra mile to help us make reservation at a very nice restaurant for dinner we really appreciate that the hotel really impressed us with the modern and grand outlook it really has everything a traveller needs location is perfect just a stone throw away from the metro station and walking distance to place de catalunya and the gothic quarters
