the property is in an excellent position for exploring barcelona the welcome on arrival was excellent and the glass of champagne was very gratefully received after a long train journey we had some problems with our door keys when we arrived but the engineer was called to resolve asap and in the meantime we were given a master key so that we could leave our things and go off to explore overall very happy with the whole experience and look forward to staying there again
