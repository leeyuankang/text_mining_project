the air con in the room as well as the roof terrace was lovely especially in the evening for cocktails especially mojitos the staff were always helpful everything was brilliant the location of the hotel was brilliant not too far from la rambla the gothic quarter and much more definitely recommend going to the manchester bar that s ace also would highly recommend eating off the la rambla and not on the main streets
