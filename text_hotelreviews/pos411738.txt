the decor of the hotel is fantastic the rooms are exceptionally clean and comfy we had a balcony which had very comfy furniture to sit and relax especially liked the drapes covering the balcony we stayed for my partners birthday the hotel surprised him with a bottle of cava and chocolates the staff are very attentive and friendly i would definatley recommend this hotel not only for what i have mentioned above but also for the location and value for money
