upon arrival we got an upgrade to a suite with a terrace the terrace was spacious and very comfortable we loved hanging out there after hectic activity packed days the room had everything we needed a hairdryer teas and coffee complimentary water it was clean and modern the location was the best thing about this hotel we aren t strong walkers but were able to easily stroll to majority of the sights listed in guide books the catalunya square is a three minute walk there are buses and a that take you to and from the airport bus also leaves from the square can get you to park guell in less than minutes definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to barcelona
