the location was perfect walking distance to most places the staff were extremely polite and helpful our room was lovely the bed so comfortable i slept really well the whole time it was my partners birthday whilst we were there and had put a bottle of bubbles and a box of chocolates in our room with a note to wish him happy birthday which was a lovely unexpected touch would definitely stay here again
