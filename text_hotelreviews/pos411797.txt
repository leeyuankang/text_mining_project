amazing location staff were so helpful and friendly and as it was my first time in barcelona they reccomended places to eat things to see also giving us a map and marking out the spots and where the hotel was located so we could easily go and explore by ourselves room was amazing and the view cleaness was a solid would go back to this hotel bar staff was lovely and the rooftop was just amazing to chill down of a night and drink a few cocktails before bed
