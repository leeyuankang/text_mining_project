just a few minutes walk to plaza catalunya and metro perfect location for tourists visiting just for a few days and don t have enough time to commute the rooms are uber modern and clean i would suggest booking a room with a balcony ours looked out to the garden very nice at night when its lit up staff were fantastic i don t think i saw a single staff who didn t greet you with a warm smile and is ready to help it means alot especially to a foreign tourist thumbs up and definitely would recommend to anyone visiting barcelona
