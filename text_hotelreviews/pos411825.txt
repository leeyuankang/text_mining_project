this hotel will make your stay in barcelona the location is unbeatable for sightseeing shopping etc the staff is incredibly helpful specifically would like to mention nacho whose recommendations were fantastic the room we had was a double room on the floor facing the main street but the double windows blocked out any noise from the street the decor is modern and room has all the conveniences you can ask for
