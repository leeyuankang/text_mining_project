we got a really good deal for this hotel and when we arrived our room was upgraded from a standard room to a balcony room so it was excellent the hotel is old but the room is nice and comfortable we stayed for nights the concierge is very helpful the location is very close to louvre museum and the metro station this makes it even more convenient
