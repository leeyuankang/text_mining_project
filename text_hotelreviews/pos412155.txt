staff were fantastic really helpful and always available i travelled here with my wife to celebrate her birthday i had contacted the hotel beforehand about this and they couldn t have been any more accommodating with all of my requests from a room upgrade to a birthday cake and a bottle of wine on her birthday they made the stay an excellent one
