great location friendly staff lovely bar area car valet service was particularly pro active the bed was comfortable and then room was very large with lounge facilities however we were kept waiting for our room and not called when it was ready the room did not smell fresh and felt stripped down to the minimum no coffee facilities payment needed to watch tv or use the internet other than wifi probably more a star hotel than
