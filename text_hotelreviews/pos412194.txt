the staff was very friendly and helpful they upgraded our room made a restaurant reservation printed out our tickets for the louvre and just generally made our stay amazing we chose to pay a little extra for a room with a view and it was well worth it our window overlooked a plaza between conseil d tat le louvre des antiquaires and the louvre
