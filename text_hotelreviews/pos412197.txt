the staff were fantastic they were so welcoming and definitely debunked the expectations of sassy french staff the hotel lobby was beautiful the room was quite spacious and comfortable and the staff did everything they could to make our stay memorable this hotel is a perfect location for a great trip to paris we were only here for one night but were so central we could walk to see all of the sights
