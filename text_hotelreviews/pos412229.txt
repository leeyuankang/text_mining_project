the location of this hotel is fantastic however overall it lacked the attention to detail you would expect for a rating the staff especially the concierge were extremely helpful however on occasion we felt rushed to finish our drinks snacks by some staff at the terrace bar despite it not being overly busy the free wifi was a welcome feature
