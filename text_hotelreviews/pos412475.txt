i choose our hotel properties based on other reviews hotel websites pictures and i guess a bit of intuition it is always a pleasure to find that the intensive research pays off and hotel miramar is no exception it delivers all it promises and the staff are a credit particularly the very hardworking pool bar and restaurant staff who diligently look after you fetching and carrying in the baking heat whilst always smiling the bedrooms are exceptional and without doubt possibly the best for all round comfort and location the views from our balcony of practically everywhere including port beach sea were simply stunning lovely molton brown toiletries and the comfiest bed and pillows awesome location property and staff oh and the breakfasts pricy at euro per person there were of us but it was delicious and beautifully presented and provided by yet another set of amazing staff just a tip if you are more than a party or family of it is going to be difficult hailing a roadside cab to accommodate extra people so better to give reception some due notice if you need transport
