the hotels situated up on mount juce and over looks the harbour we had paid the extra for a suite that was at the front of the hotel with a gorgeous balcony i had read lots of reviews about paying the extra for the suite and i can honestly say it was worth it the staff were so helpful i had a really bad headache in the middle of the night and with no paracetamol the porter had organised a taxi to go to the local pharmacy and brought me paracetamol within the smellies in the room were loccitaine and the there was a little spa shop where you could buy goods the bar food room service and restaurant were all yummy i would go back and recommend this hotel to anyone the open top bus trip stop is right out front a taxi down into the center was only euros and the walk is not too bad down the hill
