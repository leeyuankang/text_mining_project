a lovely setting and a very nice hotel on first glance spa is in need of a good lick of paint walls peeling shabby locker rooms the staff in the spa very good but just looked tired hotel view amazing originally placed in the gardens asked for a sea view we got a city sea view which was lovely food and drinks very expensive in comparison to the city itself but within prices so not too bad
