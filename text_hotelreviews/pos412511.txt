i stayed at the hotel nights and i am very pleased with my choice of the hotel the hotel staff was utmost helpful professional yet not intrusive every little request i made was attended to immediately i was hesitating whether to order breakfast or not because it is on the expensive side but i am glad that i chose to have breakfast at the hotel what you get is definitely worth the money you pay for it and it includes good quality traditional spanish food
