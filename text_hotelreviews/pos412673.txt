superb unbeatable location absolutely fantastic very friendly helpful staff excellent facilities we were lucky enough to have a big room with a lovely balcony on the floor we had a view right over plaza del catalunya we loved it and will go back there if we ever return to barcelona wifi was excellent full strength signal in our room possibly not fast enough to stream hd video but it was great for normal browsing lovely breakfast if a bit expensive
