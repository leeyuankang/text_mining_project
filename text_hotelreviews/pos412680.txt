me and my husband stopped for nights at the amazing hotel on arrival we were upgraded to a suite and given a bottle of bubbly with strawberries dipped in chocolate made our stay even more special location was perfect close to everything and allowed us to walk the ramblas everyday as the hotel is located near the ramblas there is alot of choices for food everything is located close by so we walked everywhere the hotel was always clean i admit i am very picky but i couldnt fault the hotel and we never had any issues very helpful at reception also would definately come back to the hotel again
