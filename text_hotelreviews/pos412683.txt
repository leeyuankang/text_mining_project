the hotel was so close to everything from food entertainment nightlife and banking the staff was exceptional and very helpful the rooms were posh private and spotless the hotel although located in the hustle and bustle of gothic square was private and quiet the room had plenty of space i had a really great time and will return to this hotel again when i come back to barcelona
