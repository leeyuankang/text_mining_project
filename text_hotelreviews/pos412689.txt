it s an amazing hotel with very wonderful and friendly stuff so clean very well designed rooms and its location is in the center and a few steps away from subway and bus station breakfast is quiet satisfying when we got there they provided us a room with a view of the pla a and sent our room two bottles of champagne which was a very kind gesture i will definitely stay here whenever i go to barcelona and i advise it to all my friends
