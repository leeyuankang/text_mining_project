i loved everything about this hotel it was perfectly located and the room was huge with a great rain shower a comfortable and large bed modern d cor with a great view of the plaza we were given champagne on arrival and there was a bottle waiting for us in our room they gave us another bottle the next night staff was super friendly rooms were kept spotless by the housekeeping staff we would definitely stay here again
