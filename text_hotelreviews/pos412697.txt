the staff makes this hotel shine plus the location across from the catalonia plaza makes it ideal for getting to most tourist attractions in barcelona many of the excursions tour buses and city buses are stopping right in front of the hotel the hard rock restaurant is next door and that s normally the pickup point for many tours that are booked the staff couldn t have been nicer and we were greeted by name any time we stopped to ask a question or directions
