the hotel and its staff where outstanding nothing was to much trouble and they really did go out of their way to make your stay an enjoyable one on arrival we were given a room upgrade with fantastic views of the city we didn t eat in the hotel so i can t comment on the food but i would recommend this hotel we couldn t fault it at all
