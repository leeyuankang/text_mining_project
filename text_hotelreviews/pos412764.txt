i liked the excellent service and attention to detail given by all the staff nothing was too much trouble the manager remembered our names and enquired about our comfort personally we were given a glass of champagne as we were checking in we were given an upgrade on our room on arrival which was modern and spotlessly clean the breakfast at this hotel was first rate
