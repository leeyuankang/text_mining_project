the staff at this hotel are outstanding check in restaurant advice taxi to station check out and more dealt with in an incredibly friendly and professional manner we were given an upgrade and champagne for no particular reason we couldn t drink the champagne so our minibar bill was waived the room was very comfortable quiet and overlooked the magnificent square as an added bonus we watched the christmas parade in comfort from our room we return and recommend this hotel in a heartbeat
