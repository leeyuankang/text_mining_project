great location at plaza de catalunya few meters away from ramblas road and the metro station on very short walking distance the airport shuttle bus station is in front of the hotel so its very convenient the hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming and my room has been upgraded to nice suite no doubt it will be my choice on my next visit
