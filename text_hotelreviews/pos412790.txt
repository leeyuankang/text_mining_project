the front desk staff were awesome all of them and so were the rest of the staff they were all kind helpful and well informed we were offered a free upgrade room had a fantastic view and was super clean location of the hotel in my opinion is the best you can find in barcelona if you prefer staying in the heart of the city am definitely going back there
