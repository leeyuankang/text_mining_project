i had been in olivia plaza hotel last week for nights with my sister and it was a fantastic experience and actually the hotel is one of best of the best in barcelona we had two double rooms and it were so clean and modern style and the location is so great close to the shopping areas and malls the staff was very friendly smiling all the times and always welcome us really we miss them thay provided a plate of fruits and waters in our rooms and they presented a high quality of customer service in my next trip to barcelona i will not hesitate to book their again
