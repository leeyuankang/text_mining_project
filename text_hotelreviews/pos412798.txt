great location staff was friendly and helpful we were welcomed with a surprise bottle of chilled white wine and also when we checked out after day stay however in both cases there was no bottle opener but the staff resolved that quickly when we mentioned it the bed was very good firm and supportive and the shower was powerful and spacious
