reception staff are friendly helpful and super efficient we were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous great views of plaza catalunia the suite was very well appointed with lots of space as an unexpected bonus we were treated to cava and chocolate strawberries we stayed a third night and were permitted to remain in the same room this is a wonderful hotel staffed by excellent and friendly people in a fantastic location if you a thinking this report was written by hotel staff owner you are wrong this is a genuine report and i will definitely be returning
