the staff were by far the best i ve ever found in any hotel i ve stayed in nothing was too much trouble for them they were so kind to my mother and she appreciated the front of house manager michael taking time to chat to her the hotel is in the middle of everything you need for a terrific stay in barcelona bars restaurants shops and tourist attractions the rooms are clean and very chic and i particularly enjoyed the view from our room watching the sun rise through floor to ceiling windows each morning i can not recommend this hotel enough a truly wonderful stay we will definitely return
