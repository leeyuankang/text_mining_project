my wife and i started off our honeymoon here and i requested the hotel to surprise her with some sort greeting of flowers or chocolates and instead they surprised the both of us by giving us a free upgrade to a suit and also gave us chocolate dipped strawberries it was perfect the staff were all extra nice especially marco at the reception this place is very much recommended and we will definitely visit again if we stop at barcelona in the future
