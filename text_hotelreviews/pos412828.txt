i was upgraded to the suite courtesy of the hotel the suite was very spacious with an epic view looking out on pl catalunya although my room was not ready the hotel offers additional service to store your luggage while you take your time to tour the city while your room is being prepared the staff is very friendly and optimistic i recommend this hotel to anyone that is travelling to barcelona soon the aerobus transfer from airport stops right in front of the hotel and thera are several city tour busses there too i will most definitely stay here again
