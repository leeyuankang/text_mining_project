excellent staff receptionist was very nice was nice enough to upgrade us to a city view room hotel had a very relaxed feel thank you to the doorman that was very nice too on our leave we were offered a water on checking out which the receptions realised there was none and searched for but as we had a flight to catch we suggested we would leave that offer it s the little things that count though will be returning in the near future
