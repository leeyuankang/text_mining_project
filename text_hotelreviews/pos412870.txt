after a month of travel in france and italy this was an oasis much nicer than i had expected for the price the rooms were so clean and bigger than what we had experienced in other hotels on our trip the bathroom is unusual with a frosted glass sliding door but not a problem for us the doormen were delightful and gave us good advice re security on the streets and trains the front desk staff were welcoming and generous with their time without even asking we were given maps and ideas of where to go and they went out of their way to help us fix a problem we had with a viator tour in fact they arranged a much better option at a lower price than viator offered the breakfast was also better than expected with a spacious dining room including the option to have breakfast in the sun room or open patio the breakfast options were lovely smoothies and nutella crepes were a nice suprise plus the usual hot foods and so on our room was quiet and the beds very comfortable the position is brilliant the airport shuttle bus is so close a metro station even closer great shopping centre on the corner and les ramblas is also on the corner we walked to lots of nice restaurants and the old cathedral and used public transport without a worry
