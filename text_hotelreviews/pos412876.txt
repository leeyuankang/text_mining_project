very central could get from aeroport bus to hotel across placa very easily or indeed for cheaper with a taxi if you are a group of four negotiate comfortable good sized bed good views from top floor over barri gothic and placa de catalunya but could not see the familia sagrada from our room as indicated by the website very helpful reception staff who were always cheerful and booked us a restaurant we had chosen door men always greeted us with a smile
