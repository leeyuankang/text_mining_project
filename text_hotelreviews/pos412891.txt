the experience was excellent from the start we got a complimentary upgrade to a room overlooking the square but despite the championship celebrations of fc barcelona there was not a sound to be heard we had a bit of problems with a loud party next door and notified the management big surprise that we received a bottle of cava and chocolate dipped strawberries the next day on our last day just when we had a late evening flight back home my wife fell ill and we received a late check out the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating all through our stay great job thank you
