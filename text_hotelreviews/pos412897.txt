we missed our flight and arrived one day later the hotel kindly upgraded us to a superior room with a great view of the main square and also included breakfast for free and said we could check out later than usual on our last day which i thought was a nice touch we didn t ask for any of the above and i thought it was such a good move by the hotel to make up for our lost day staff are professional and friendly and we would definately stay here again when in barcelona
