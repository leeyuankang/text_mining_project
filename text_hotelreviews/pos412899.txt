everything about the hotel and staff was excellent we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and when the reception staff found out we had a bottle of champagne delivered to our room our room overlooked the main square so we sat and people watched whilst drinking our champagne the room was very modern clean and spacious and the shower was excellent to be honest the whole hotel was clean tidy and very friendly and above all a good price we had a wonderful three day stay
