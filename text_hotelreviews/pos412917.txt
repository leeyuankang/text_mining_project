the location is wonderful as it is close to restaurants a large grocery store metro stops hop on hop off bus stops the aerobus stop to the airport and the bus stop for some day tours outside barcelona perfect base for sightseeing within barcelona as it is at the top of las ramblas and close to the gothic quarter nice bright large clean rooms my husband now wants us to install a similar rain shower head in our shower excellent internet connectivity we opted for twin beds and they were comfortable we stayed here twice over a period of three weeks once for four nights and another for one night before and after a cruise we informed them that we would be arriving early on both visits i expected that we would need to leave our luggage but we were pleasantly surprised when they let us check in to our rooms upon arrival both times at no additional cost we had a little inconvenience with workmen doing work outside our room at a m normally not a problem since we are usually up and out early hotel staff responded to our concerns immediately reception staff was not aware that work was to be done on our floor that morning and they said that work is usually done later in the day to avoid any disruptions for guests staff went over and above in ensuring that the rest of our stay was wonderful can t say enough about the staff all employees that we saw and dealt with from reception to doorman to restaurant staff were very pleasant friendly and very helpful the one minor drawback to the room is that we wish there more electrical outlets also the placement of the existing outlets could have been better there were two outlets in the bathroom and one at the desk available for use we unplugged a lamp to use an outlet by a bed we travel with two phones two tablets two fitbits two cameras and one curling iron which makes charging items a challenge next time we are in barcelona this is were we will stay
