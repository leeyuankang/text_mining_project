we liked everything it s simply fantastic staff was great everybody they spoilt us since the first second we stepped into the reception hall we were welcomed with a glass of ice cold cava we were walked to our fantastic room on the floor with spectacular view on plaza catalunya the room is very spacious cosy bright of nice design and comfy before we discovered our room we asked for an upgrade of accommodation as it was not available the staff offered us free full breakfast on the first day delicious then when we came back in the evenings we found in the room a bottle on cava in ice on the first day and a platter of cheese and ham bottle of red wine on the second day extraordinary we would highly reccommed this hotel position is also strategic perfect right in the middle of the city and of easy access to transfer to the airport
