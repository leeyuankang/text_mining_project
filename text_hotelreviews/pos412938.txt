we loved the customer service we received at this hotel the staff could not do enough for us are so welcoming the room upgrade was one of our highlights of our weekend away beautiful penthouse room comfy bed and stunning views of the city the location is perfect central for everything you need second walk to the metro and just around the corner to la rambla on arrival the cava brought to the room with chocolate covered strawberries were a lovely and unexpected extra making the trip that little more special and enjoyable we could not fault the hotel and we will most definitely be returning in the future
