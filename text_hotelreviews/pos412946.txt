absolutely perfect location with easy access to all of the main tourist attractions had a great room overlooking the busy catalunya placa square was a little worried it would be noisy but we honestly couldn t hear any outside noise wonderful all the staff were very friendly and welcoming and reception staff in particular were always ready to help with any questions and advice
