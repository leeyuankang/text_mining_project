at the most we liked very friendly and helpful attitude of the staff at the front desk they were efficient in helping in all we asked for including making reservations for a concert with no assigned seats when we arrived we were given the best seats reserved for us in the already full auditorium and we arrived last minute when we come to barcelona next time your hotel will be again the place we shall stay congratulations and keep up with great work hospitality
