lovely hotel staff were so friendly and helpful i made the mistake of booking three night when we needed four nights hotel staff were most helpful and upgraded us for the last three nights instead of just the last night which we had paid the up grade on due to the hotel being full such a lovely stay in barcelona close to la rumbla and easy access to the hop on hop off bus tour would definitely recommend this hotel we did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are some many options within walking distance
