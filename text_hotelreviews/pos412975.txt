staff were so friendly and helpful we booked for three nights but my error i was suppose to book for nights so we paid the extra to upgrade for the night staff were so helpful and they upgraded us for the last nights instead of just the last night very clean and comfortable rooms location is amazing walking distance to la rumbla and hop on hop off bus tour
