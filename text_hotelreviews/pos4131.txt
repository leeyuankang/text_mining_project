we stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered awesome location we liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible i think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before it sure wasn t the room stunk had a bank of about aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool the bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good they also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu
