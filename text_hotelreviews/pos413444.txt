the location for this hotel is fantastic opposite the majic fountains the aerobus to and farm el prat airport stops directly outside and is only and runs every minutes you couldn t get a better location as the placa espanya is one of the main routes into the city i have to say cristina on reception was so helpful and helped us so much
