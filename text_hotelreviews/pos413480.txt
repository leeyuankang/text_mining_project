great value for price extremely clean and excellent view from the room kind personnel and fast service we booked before effectively arriving to the hotel did not have the time to enjoy all the facilities but would definitely recommend to anyone perfectly connected with the metro to all the rest of the city and much more comfortable than many other places to reach the airport mins taxi drive
