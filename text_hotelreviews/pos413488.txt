the breakfast was very good and the staff were excellent and very accommodating it is great there are a few computers in the lobby for guests and the bonus was a printer it was out of ink but the staff behind the desk were great as they printed out the things we needed after we emailed them the location is near a large museum we like walking and did not mind the hour stroll to la rambla though we did use the train and the station was right outside the hotel the bus to the airport also stopped right outside the hotel our room had a large safe large bed very nice pool area and good views
