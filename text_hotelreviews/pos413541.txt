overall it was great being at this hotel the staff is wonderful the room is clean the mall is three mins away however for people that shop as a sport might not find this mall super exciting there is a great range of high class restaurants around and international cuisine the stores inside the mall are alright there is no zara for that you will have to go to the other malls el corto ingles is an okay mall but no restaurants other than the cafeteria the national museum is within walking distance its wonderful on saturday the entrance is for free the hotel has many restaurants it was overwhelming to pick one you can walk to different places from this hotel the pool is wonderful the view is great
