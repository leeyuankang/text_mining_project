the view from our room was stunning it was very convenient in the sense that ithere was a taxi rank at the front of the hotel and a shopping centre across the road and several restaurants and coffee shops nearby it was an easy minute walk to la rambla and pl catalunya which we found a little too chaotic after a few hours the staff was most courteous and polite
