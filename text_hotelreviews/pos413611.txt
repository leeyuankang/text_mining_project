the rooftop pool was brilliant could be a few more sunbeds but we managed to get one each time complimentary beach towels also good bar staff were friendly the food looked nice but we ate out instead clean rooms and housekeeping gave us fresh toiletries each day mini bar was able to be used as a fridge which was also good although one of our rooms had no mini bar at all which was a bit inconvenient great location the magic fountains are a mins walk the otherside of the roundabout theres a large shopping centre across the road with restaurants supermarket also lots of nice small restaurants on the surrounding roads
