the rooftop pool had the most fantastic setting with views over plaza espana and the truly beautiful museum of art across the way having a poolside sangria with those exceptional views made our little mini break we re quite into walking so nothing was more than mins away from the hotel the hotel was perfectly located for the metro and the airport bus the stops were outside the hotel the room was lovely and the hotel staff were fantastic
