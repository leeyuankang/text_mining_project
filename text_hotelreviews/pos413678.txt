read a few reviews saying that this hotel wasn t as good as advertised so i was very pleased when we arrived to find it exceeded my expectations the hotel and rooms were extremely clean staff friendly and helpful our room had an incredible view and the beds were very comfy the bar pool area is amazing furnished luxiouriously with beautiful bed loungers also an incredible view of the magic fountain from up here the airport bus is also right outside the hote and gets to the airport in about minutes for under so we would recommend doing this
