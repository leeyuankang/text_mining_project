the hotel was immaculate everywhere looked brand new it was on a busy roundabout but you could hear a pin drop in the bedrooms the view from the rooftop pool was incredible tourist bus was right outside wasn t in the best location but a cab to la ramblas was under and there was a metro station nearby breakfast was delicious
