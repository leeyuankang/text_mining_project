absolutely loved my stay at this hotel we stayed in suite room the views were incredible and the room itself was lovely especially loved the bath tub hotel located next to a shopping centre and a pleasant walk away from the mercat de la boqueria would return here we did not get up in time for breakfast nor did we experience the food in the hotel however
