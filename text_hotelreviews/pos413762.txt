i traveled with my partner to barcelona to take part in the marathon this is the most ideal location for any runner thinking of staying in the city during there stay not only very close to the start and finish of the race but also an ideal location for picking up your bib number the hotel even put on an early breakfast to accommodate runners taking part in the race highly recommend
