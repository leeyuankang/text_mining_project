one of the managers did her best to make our stay better after our complaints about the stench in the room we were compensated for two nights we eventually got what we booked for which was a clean room firm mattress and a bathroom with a shower and tub the nespresso in the room was great and we really liked the japanese restaurant at the hotel from the hotel there is a decent view of the magic font about kilometer away but one of the venetian tower blocks the center view the perfect view is from the center of the placa d espanya but that circle is completely blocked on new years eve
