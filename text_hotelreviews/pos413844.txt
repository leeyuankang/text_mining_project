we booked connecting rooms due to young kids and got what booked however on the first night and next morning we found lots of bedbugs in both rooms beds and the skirtings of the bed which is not obviously changed with each customer the bedbugs were all over the place we alerted staff who changed us to other connecting rooms other side of the same floor however these rooms were with dirtiest of floors i ve ever seen and even after requests to clean the floors the cleaning ladies only shortly brushed the areas it was like walking on street with sand and who knows what further requests did not even get filled i had in my own room no aircon working for the whole day stay with sweaty nights no amount of complaining helped to get any change in this predicament at last morning before leaving we found bedbugs in these rooms as well i did get a promise of refund on no aircon room though but am still waiting for it hotel is generally super dirty all trough corridors and ceilings and sitcoms and especially the rooms no real cleaning happening and on top of that you will personally feed a legion of bedbugs during your stay
