the rooms are clean tidy and comfortable the only problem which is very minor is that there is no milk for coffee tea in the room this may have something to do with temperature one needs to go to the restaurant for a cup of the same the breakfast is superb all round with great choices to serve all and again very clean and well laid out the staff are really professional in all aspects of the hotel business this is the fifth time we have used the hotel whilst in barcelona travelling through to the south
