for travellers coming from the airport this hotel has a fantastic location it is literally above the barcelo sants train station which is just stops from el prat airport note if you take the train make sure to get some euros in the airport credit cards were not accepted when i went to buy my ticket it s about a minute walk to the train station depending on which terminal you arrive in the ticket is only euros so a real value to get to the hotel in some towns the neighbourhood hotels around a train station are not so nice this is not the case with barcelo sants train station perhaps one of the cleanest most chic train stations i ve ever seen there s a small shopping mall and you can find some decent food if your a gourmet do your research on restaurants as most of the restaurants near the train station are tourist traps one was absolutely awful sometimes there can be a bit of a wait to see the receptionist which is a minor annoyance however there are so many benefits to this hotel besides the convenient transfer from the airport the hotel uses a fresh room fragrance in the lobby hallways really nice touch i had a standard room i had luggage for a month stay in europe and the drawer space is pretty sparse with people don t expect you ll be able to fully unpack the overriding feature of my room was the quietness the soundproofing is amazing the only thing i could occasionally hear people in the hallway but zero outside noise i was on the floor so not sure if the lower floors are as quiet also there are blackout shades which were fantastic since there is a very large window which takes up most of one wall i was about hours in transit to barcelona since i had to drive to my airport in los angeles i was exhausted and also had jet lag
