the hotel is really spacious we had a junior suite which was exceptional the facilities from the nespresso coffee machine and large quantities of capsules daily through to the hairdryer and bulgari toiletries were really nice touches the bathroom was exceptional a huge and i do mean huge bath and a shower that could have held a rugby team the room was cleaned throughly with fresh linens and bedding daily all exceptional quality the location of the hotel above the sants station is ideal if you have a late arrival or early train departure we are quite energetic and walked backwards and forwards into the older part of town its quite safe to do so but be prepared it is quite a long walk there and back you could easily get a taxi or metro if you don t want to walk but if you do you get to see some great restaurants and bars i would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again if i arrived by train and would recommend it and the wonderful staff highly
