the location is superb right on top of the main railway and metro station which has decent affordable restaurants particularly como the hotel is also reasonably close to the airport as well as the port and there s a taxi stand right outside the hotel the staff are professional friendly and helpful they allowed us to check in at in the morning although check in time is p m gave us maps to the city and provided correct information on the taxi fare to one of the places we wished to visit the decor is science fiction themed which we found original and interesting and we also liked the rooms which followed the same theme and were clean and neat with big floor length windows
