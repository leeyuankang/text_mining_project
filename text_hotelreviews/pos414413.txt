good location above the railway station on the metro taxi bus routes very comfy beds room facilities good choices for breakfast from central location gives you easy transport choices our second visit but not our last we were delayed hours by rail arrived at to be greeted with a friendly face a reserved room although the hotel was full we were late a kettle for a hot drink before bed recommended
