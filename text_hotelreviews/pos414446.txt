room was comfy and clean beds extremely comfortable even though the hotel is located directly over the main train station it was very quiet service excellent our mini bar wasn t working upon arrival but was exchanged within minutes assistance with online booking of tickets to tourist attractions even got a piece of cake on my bday the hotel is not centrally located but there are excellent connections with all locations via metro subway or train
