hotel was gorgeous and quirky staff were very helpful and spoke very good english room was spacious and clean they have put in a lot of detail with the space theme it s a great location with a short walk to shops and restaurants in all directions plus plenty of options for transport bus taxi train would defiantly recommend and would stay again thank you
