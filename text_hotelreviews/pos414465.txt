i was stuck in barcelona because of a delayed flight so i had to book something for the same night room was clean and comfortable the sci fi theme carried throughout the hotel made me chuckle the right hint of humor staff were very polite and helpful the breakfast buffet is pricey but delicious and it has plenty of variety oh and right on top of sants train station so awfully convenient if arriving departing from there
