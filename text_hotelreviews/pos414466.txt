the central location right above the train station was nice the neighbourhood around the hotel is quiet and quaint and has a very authentic barcelona feel to it the hotel itself was wonderful and quiet there were parties going on downstairs but you wouldn t know upstairs the space theme was nice and being christmas there was a floating christmas tree hotel rooms were cleaned promptly both days i came back at p m to drop things off and the rooms were finished the beds are huge and the wifi is excellent enough to stream netflix
