to my surprise the hotel is scifi themed i was greeted by when entering the hotel and the they paid attention to details even the fonts used for all the signage is close to the ones used in the star wars movies the hallways look like right out of a starship and even the elevator doors are painted like the doors in the movie the hotel is conveniently located on top of the sants railway station so right from the hotel one has access to all public transport also a huge taxi waiting area is located there so it is never a problem to pick up a taxi and all taxi drivers know the hotel and therefore are able to take you there the staff are friendly helpful and speak good english
