the style of the hotel was quite grand and the christmas decorations were lovely and festive the location was perfect for my needs and there are lots of shops and cafes very nearby for e g breakfast or lunch with pubs and restaurants close too or very short walk away for even more choice i was in a single room that was well suited size wise the layout of the room is well considered and the most is made of the space
