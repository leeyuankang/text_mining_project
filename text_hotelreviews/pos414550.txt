breakfast was euros big buffet where nothing was missing scrambled and boiled eggs we avoided both strange texture and taste but you can order omlets or fried eggs made on the spot as we had breakfast late never before there was hardly any queuing for coffee location is good quiet but central not for walking but to take public transport beds are very comfortable
