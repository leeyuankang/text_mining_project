the whole hotel was absolutely amazing to look at and our room was just fantastic with a great view and especially the extra large bed location was perfect and it was so easy to get around with the metro and trains being literally underneath the city tour bus was only a minute walk too which was perfect to take in the sights would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone i knew coming to barcelona and next time i come visit will be staying here again
