spotless beautiful rooms comfortable beds hotel experience was excellent i stayed with my year old and she was enchanted with the whole place said it was like staying on a spaceship perfect location for the station we had travelled by train from scotland so it was a welcome relief to find a hotel right on the doorstep breakfast was ok would definately return not cheap but worth it wifi good
