very good location with excellent transport links the hotel is literally sitting on top of the sants rail loads of local regional and national links and metro lines station the space theme is really nice and it gives the hotel a nice twist for those who would like to experience more than just a standard modern contemporary hotel room the rooms are very clean comfortable and reasonably spacious with a very nice and big walk in shower cabin and cool electrical window blinds you can completely shut down bonus points for the little extras in the room ikea style breakfast tables shaving vanity toothbrush packs and the ice cube dispensers on the and floors excellent to have at hand especially during the summer months if you re lucky enough you may even get a room with some very nice views of the city i was able to spot the tip of sagrada familia even though my room was on the floor would definitely stay here again
