perfect location for us as we arrived by train from girona been to the costa brava and left on the fast train to paris fairly early the next morning loved the decor very new and stylish our room was lovely very quiet and extremely comfortable tea and coffee making facilities as well as an interesting view of all the taxis had a quick breakie downstairs in the train station there are several places to get food plus a pharmacy a mcdonald s etc wifi great would highly rate this hotel if you are travelling by train
