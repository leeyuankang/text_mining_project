the room was very well laid out and comfortable the location of the hotel was ideal as i was travelling on the train from malaga and after a long journey having the hotel above the station was very welcoming there was no noise from the trains within the rooms the space theme was really interesting in the main areas if not a little stark but i liked it and it was a shame i only had night there breakfast was buffet style with a good range of food and an opportunity to have your eggs cooked personally by one of the chefs any way you wanted them the staff were friendly and helpful and i called room service and they responded very quickly despite the hotel being very full
