you can t ask for a better location very central although it is located next to a busy rail station and a bus depot it is surprisingly quiet once you enter the hotel area it cost us less than euros to arrive at the hotel from the cruise terminal by taxi and from the hotel to the airport it was an easy train ride and very very cheap fare
