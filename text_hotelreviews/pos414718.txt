first of all they brought me cake it was my birthday i went out to run errands and my father went out to explore his surroundings when i returned a generous slice of chocolate layered cake was waiting patiently in our room candle and all it was more than enough for both of us i felt very special everything else was terrific my father is a tall elderly man with mobility challenges he is the type to go for campgrounds over hotels but that wasn t feasible for this trip i needed something close to public transportation at the end of our trip so i booked this room thinking he would simply have to tolerate it instead he loved it he said it was the most comfortable hotel of the five we had stayed in he was very excited about the large shower with two different shower head heights the shower is large easy to walk into and has shower heights for both tall and short people he loved the view the bed light the abundant sockets and the comfort of the bed
