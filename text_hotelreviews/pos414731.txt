good service and nice idea of the hotel you will enjoy it if you like space quite good location close to the spain square and fountains minutes walk and to the metro min we didn t have breakfasts but if you want plenty of cafes are at your disposal right beneath the hotel yes it is on the top of train station but you don t recognize it
