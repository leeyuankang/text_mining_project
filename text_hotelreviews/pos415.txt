great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the earl s court underground station clean quiet breakfast was a good quality and selection nice pillows lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains newly remodeled marble slate bathroom mini fridge in room desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up beautiful garden area i didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area
