my best friend and i had a fantastic stay at le sebastopol the theater theme is really fun as there is so much to take in so definitely tour the hotel when you arrive there is even a private movie theater downstairs along with a cute private patio out back we traveled overnight and were exhausted so they checked us in early to catch a nap which was so appreciated the room was adorably decorated very girly and perfect for us plus we had a quaint little balcony where we sipped our wine and watched the streets below the area is a little less congested than others but easy to walk or metro to many attractions the best reason to stay at the hotel is definitely the staff they are warm and accommodating my favorite was the late night crew as we were often coming back after hours serge and xavier are wonderful and made our stay one we will always remember if you are unsure where to go we absolutely recommend le sebastopol
