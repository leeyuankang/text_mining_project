location wise it was fine being situated close to the overground and the tube station there are also multiple shops in the neighbourhood for food groceries and knickknacks the room that we had was large enough considering london standards and the three of us did not feel boxed in although we stayed for nights staff was helpful the breakfast spread was also very decent
