from check in to check out i loved this hotel i was staying for business working close by at lords cricket ground so the location was ideal and close to a tube station connecting me to the rest of the city the staff were extremely helpful the room was incredible loved it bed was so comfy the pillows too and the shower was very powerful which was great i liked the random addition of the knock on the door with free chocolates random but cool i could not recommend this hotel enough
