the hotel was lovely and modern within less than minute walk to kilburn park underground which gets you into central london in around mins secure underground parking is expensive but for the security worth it the room was clean modern and comfortable my only small issue was there was no bath only a shower and after a long day walking round london would have been lovely to have a soak within walking distance there are various shops and eateries wouldn t hesitate to book again
