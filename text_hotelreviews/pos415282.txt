my family were emigrating to seattle so this hotel was perfectly situated for us whilst they finalised their move the staff were helpful friendly and exceptionally cooperative in what was a stressful time for us our rooms were ideal for us and the choice and standard of food at breakfast was magnificent i know that i am biased in my views of kilburn but this place is ideal to explore not only locally but the whole of london
