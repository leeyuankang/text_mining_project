the staff were lovely the receptionist was making small talk i didn t realise i would get a cake card and wine as i mentioned it was a birthday present very attentive when making requests spare toothbrush extra milk i would definately recommend it as a cosy friendly hotel but if you are looking for a nice spa it is not ideal
