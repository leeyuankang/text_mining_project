the queen sized bed was very large and comfortable the pillows were so soft i fell asleep as soon as my head touched them the breakfast was a varied selection and everything i had tasted very good my young son loved the sausages the staff were pleasant and helpful i also really liked the self serve iced lemon water available by the front door nice touch on a hot day
