we had a fantastic stay the staff are really amazing very helpful and friendly they go the extra bit to help the hotel is tastefully decorated with the cinema theme our room was based on concert so we loved the drum side tables the service is excellent they provide premium toiletries welcome chocolates and of course there is a wide selection of movies completely free we also loved the afternoon tea and cakes included at the hotel the breakfast is also good with lots of choice
