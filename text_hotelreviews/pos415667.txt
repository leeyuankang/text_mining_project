beautiful hotel in a fantastic location a little bit of luxury at the end of our holiday we walked all over london from the hotel and the shopping on the doorstep was amazing we booked a room with club lounge access and were very glad we did as it is such a great facility the beds were wonderfully comfortable and the shower was great too the service from all the staff we encountered was excellent we hope to be back one day soon
