have been to london many many times and been to many hotels i honestly am in love with this one the whole experience from the entrance and the greeting to the friendly and welcoming receptionist clean and cozy room and a very nice bar the rooms were quiet with a nice view coming from switzerland i always have a problem with the charger but not this time they had usb ports on the wall the position of the hotel is just above oxford circus which is good for those who want to go shopping or visit attractions or just go around the lobby is also amazing i will be using this hotel for my future visits to london i finally found the perfect location and service in london
