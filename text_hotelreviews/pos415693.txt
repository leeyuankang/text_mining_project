frankly disappointing i usually stay at claridges and was expecting similar service levels on first day of my stay it took an hour and a half to get a simple document scanned and emailed to me and i had to ask three different people on reception to assist i was told when checking in that it may be possible to change my room which was end of corridor with a view of brick wall this didn t particularly bother me but thought it was a nice touch and shame no one followed up on it no information was given about breakfast gym opening times the newspaper i ordered on day of check out did not arrive no bespoke or particularly attentive service by any staff in the hotel nothing particularly wrong just felt soulless and was not the experience i was looking forward to
