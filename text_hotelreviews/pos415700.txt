worth the extra for the excellence club something that sets this hotel apart from others in london fantastic food and drinks including champagne made the stay extra special nothing was too much for the staff in the excellence club they were attentive and an asset to the hotel thank you for making the stay so memorable and i would definitely stay here on my next trip to london
