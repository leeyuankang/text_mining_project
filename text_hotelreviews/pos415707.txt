from the minute we walked through the door we felt like honoured guests every member of staff was so welcoming and couldn t do enough for us i had emailed in advance to say that it was a special anniversary treat and when we got to our room we found a full bottle of champagne chocs cake and a card they also told the roux restaurant and we got the same treatment when we went there on on first night i booked a room which gave access to the club lounge amazing food and free flowing drinks all included well worth the little extra on the room the whole place was simply stunning
