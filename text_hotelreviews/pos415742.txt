staff were unfailingly courteous and attentive without being obtrusive they seemed genuinely happy to be helpful the rooms were spacious comfortable and quiet we were given a room adjoining that of our three daughters a thoughtful touch my husband even received a birthday card and complimentary birthday cake on arrival in the room unasked for but much appreciated our booking gave us access to the club which meant a lavish buffet breakfast snacks all day and champagne pretty much on tap my husband also enjoyed use of the pool downstairs within walking distance of everywhere in central london we would have liked to have stayed longer
