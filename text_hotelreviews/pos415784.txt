staff were aware we were visiting for my girlfriend s birthday and left a card and a box of chocolates in the room nice touch extremely accommodating of requests we made we arrived earlier than check in time so they moved our booking to a newer nicer room that was available earlier stored our luggage and sent me a text when the room was available of course it s expensive but given the facilities of the hotel and the luxury of the establishment not mention a superb central london location i thought the price represented excellent value for money compared to other similar hotels spa facilities no charge for access were excellent and a significant reason why i chose the langham would absolute stay again budget allowing we had a great time here and were made to feel extremely welcome staff weren t at all stuffy or snobby or anything like that fantastic experience
