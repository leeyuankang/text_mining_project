the staff at the langham are as good as i have experienced in any london hotel nothing is too much trouble and they go out of their way to make your stay memorable the rooms are very well equipped with lots of additional touches turn down service water and chocolates the hotel also benefits from having the best bar in london with a great atmosphere and exceptional staff
