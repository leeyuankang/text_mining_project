this was a great little find in a lovely district the hotel is tastefully done and we were lucky to get upgraded to a superior suite the staff was very friendly and pleasant in sharp contrast to another hotel we stayed at the first time we visited paris the hotel even has a little cinema screen and a list of movies to choose from the bar is nice and there are plenty of board games to choose from all these mattered because we happened to visit paris on the weekend of the multiple terrorist attacks across the city the hotel was therefore our little refuge will definitely be going back
