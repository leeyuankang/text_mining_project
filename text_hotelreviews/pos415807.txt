the whole experience was outstanding the staff were friendly smart and could not help us enough the rooms were classy with all modern facilities for example above the desk there were multiple socket types that would accept every type of electrical plug from around the world no adaptors needed in addition there were sockets to connect all types of media directly into the tv another example of the langham anticipating your needs prior to you knowing you have them the artesian cocktail bar inside the hotel was also an unexpected delight i can not recommend the langham enough
