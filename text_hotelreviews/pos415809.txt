the staff made us feel so welcome even though we only stayed one night and didn t book the most expensive room the hotel is so clean it sparkles our room was spacious even with an extra bed for our son we could open the bedroom window so slept well and although it was a friday evening and the hotel was busy once inside our room it was peaceful and quiet
