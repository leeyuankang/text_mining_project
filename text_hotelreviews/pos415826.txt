the room seemed quite average on first impressions but the en suite bathroom made up for it it really had the wow factor the bed was amazing huge comfy and a deep feather topper ensured a great night s rest i was very impressed to see crystal champagne flutes in the glass selection with the minibar and the toiletries were very generous staff treated us to a gift each of belgian chocolates as we were there for our birthdays and gave us a handwritten birthday card fabulous location and very quiet considering how central we were in london
