absolutely everything about our stay at the langham was exemplary every need was catered to with the minimum of fuss and great solicitude and care it was a truly magnificent way to celebrate a special birthday from the supremely comfortable beds to the magnificent bath shower the soft towels bathrobes etc it was a magical experience the surprise of a birthday cake provided by the hotel was quite literally the icing on the cake
