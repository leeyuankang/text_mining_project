great location welcoming and attentive staff the food was delicious highly sourced and well presented i don t usually drink wine but the riesling recommended in the roux at the landau was a gorgeous accompaniment to the food the bed was heavenly overall a delightful experience the hotel is not ostentatious but has a quality of style and decor that makes you want to come back we will too
