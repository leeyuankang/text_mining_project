overall impression of hotel was elegant and spotless bed comfort amazing as was bed linen towels surprisingly old and lifeless by comparison room and bathroom pristine and a pleasure to use loved combining the experience with dinner at roux at the landau entered from the hotel lobby in summary its expensive but a case of getting what you pay for and for me and my partner a fantastic treat
