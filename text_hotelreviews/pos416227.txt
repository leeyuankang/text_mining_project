the ned looks fabulous and the attention to detail in the period design is just fabulous whilst the bedrooms themselves are small the facilities especially the downstairs pool and spa area are really world class of equal quality are the staff every single person i interacted with at the ned was cheerful helpful and genuinely seemed to be enjoying working there for a hotel club restaurant centre that is as crazily busy as the ned is that s impressive i d like to thank them all for making my stay pleasant the jazz inspired entrainment is great the food what i managed to get at least is fine the cow shed bathing products in the rooms are a fantastic addition
