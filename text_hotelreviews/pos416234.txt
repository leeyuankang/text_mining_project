super cool hotel that is totally unique in london the setting of the old hsbc hq mixed with the s glamour vibe that they have decorated the hotel in is a really stunning mix all of the restaurants and bars are in the huge bustling lobby with a band stand in the middle where you get great live music everything was stunning especially the vault bar downstairs where you sit in a setting of old safety deposit boxes from the original bank
