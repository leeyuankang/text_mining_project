loved the vibe and decor features of the original edwin lutyens building formerly midlands bank and then hsbc were left pretty much intact which gave the impression that the hotel had been there forever whereas it had only been opened just over a month when we arrived the rooftop bar was fantastic the staff were great really helpful and the choice of dining terrific we particularly enjoyed coffee in the lobby bar and loved the food at kaia we liked it so much when we first stayed there we chose to stay there again a week later when we returned to london
