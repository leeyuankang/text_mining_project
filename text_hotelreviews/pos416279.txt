this star hotel was amazing the views from the rooftop bar were stunning the facilities are endless the hotel staff were very friendly polite and accommodating i would definitely recommend having a drink in the vault bar we liked everything about the hotel and will definitely be coming back to stay very soon it s definitely one of a kind for the city the rooms sell out very quick so book in advance to avoid disappointment
