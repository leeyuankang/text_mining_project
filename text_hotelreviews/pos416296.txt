everything fantastic ambience the moment we walked into the hotel lobby which is like no other hotel live band playing multiple restaurants lots of people just hanging out and plenty of buzz rooms were good beds very comfy excellent toiletries i wish all hotels in the world have bathroom toiletries like the ned makes every bath a different experience
