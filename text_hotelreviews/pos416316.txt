the best cosy room i have ever stayed in i have never come across a bathroom so well stocked with everything you could think of and all the toiletries in full size bottles cowshed so no skimping also thank you for putting ceiling lights in the bedroom so many rooms these days only have wall lights i had dinner with my nieces in millies restaurant and it was excellent my only moan is i could not get into the roof top restaurant even though i was a resident it would be helpful if you could book in advance other than that excellent hotel and would definitely recommend it
