beautiful room all very high quality with a roberts radio playing jazz when we arrived amazing selection of cowshed products and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into everything being perfect for guests they even provide hair straighteners and an array of phone chargers the roof top terrace was amazing i have stayed in a few hotels and this was absolutely one of the best i don t think there is anywhere better to stay in london
