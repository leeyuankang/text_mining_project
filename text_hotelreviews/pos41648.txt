i arrived early and even though my room wasn t ready yet the staff made us feel welcome and got us settled for breakfast we don t speak french but their english was perfect so we understood each other perfectly breakfast was ok but nothing too special compared to the parisian cafes we enjoyed the shower had great hot water and pressure something we have learned is not common in europe the bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet
