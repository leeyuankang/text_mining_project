victor and marlene helped us so much since our last hotel left one of our bags at the concierge and they drove to pick up our bag so that we could have it before our flight also claudia from the front desk was so helpful to us during our stay with directions and recommendations of things to do all the staff were extremely nice and always had a nice demeanor very respectful and with a smile the hotel really aims to please their guests the room was great it was the grey room and the modern decor is very cool we had complimentary drinks in the mini bar that they restocked every day and the front desk also gave us cold water bottles before we left when we told them we needed to get to the airport by a certain time they ordered the taxi and had it loaded with our bags in advance so when we came back from our walk everything was packed and ready to go we will definitely come back to the sofitel
