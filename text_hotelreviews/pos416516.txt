we rang the hotel the day before to confirm our booking and to ask if we could store our bags before check in this was no problem the next day at we arrived to the hotel expecting not to be able to go to our room until check in time but to our surprise the staff behind the counter warmly welcomed us and stated we have been complementary upgraded with our room to the floor this room was overlooking the chapel and the room is ready now the room is perfect and we would definitely recommend staying here
