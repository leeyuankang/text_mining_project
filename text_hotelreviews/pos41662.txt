i have stayed in many hotels in paris and not one has been as wonderful as this one the location is ideal for any traveller taxi s costing no more than to go around to the most famous spots in paris on entering the hotel you are greeted by wonderful beaming faces of staff who clearly love their job you can feel their warmth and gratitude towards each guest everything is explained to you and they provide you with a care package to help you when getting around paris equipped with a map of the city the metro map and a personal conversation to help you make the most of your time in the city the best part of the care package never feel hungry again the hotel is part of a group of hotels which all work together to provide you an open bar of food and drinks all around the city you can stop into any hotel and flash the special card and be led to a bar full of treats and drinks to enjoy at your hearts desire the rooms are gorgeous quirky enough without being over powering the beds are huge and this is a definite plus as my partner is a very tall man he didn t suffer from his usual feet hanging off the end of the bed the balconies in the room are a sweet little touch esprcially for those travelling in the warmer months the cleaning staff are amazing and so attentive most could speak fluent english too and were well equipped to answer all questions as perfectly as front of house i have travelled the world staying in some of the top hotels in different countries and none have come close to the attentiveness of this one the small treats thaybthey give you every evening as well as a handout with the next day s forecast is such a nice touch the m ms and macaroons that greet you as you enter your room on first arrival really do sweeten the whole deal it was my boyfriends birthday and the staff spoiled him with kind words and a bottle of champagne too
