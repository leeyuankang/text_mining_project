it was a convenient location walking distance from train station and the centre it is about min walk to jordan and anne franks house and walk to the van goh museum however you can get the tram from the station which is walk the room was comfortable and the minibar is complimentary the pool area is just ok but nice to be able to relax at the sauna after a day of walking
