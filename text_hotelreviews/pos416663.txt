walking into the room our mouths dropped it was huge and that was just a standard room the open mini bar was a fantastic feature that they should include with all star hotels it was fully stocked every day the service was what you d expect from a star place friendly and also funny staff were there to help everywhere you looked the location was central to the shopping and restaurant districts i wish i had a chance to dip into the pool however it did look relaxing
