the location of the hotel is near grand station and service and staff are quiet helpful and polite it is a popular hotel due to its location and rooms as offered though it is sort of a labyrinth as it appears to an old some sort of public exchange building now converted into a hotel but the building in itself is nice though it is in centre but it is located at one corner and you need to walk a bit to reach major attractions but walking in itself a pleasure and every road every corner has a story of its own the rooms are fairly large and comfortable bedding my room had an excellent view though i wouldn t say the same for my friends who got a separate room so would suggest that a room with a view of side canal be preferred and be requested at the time of booking itself the hotel is quiet packed and we were unable to seek any accommodation for early check in as we arrived quiet early in the day and we deposited our luggage and came back after touring the city for a while we preferred to eat outside as amsterdam has lovely cafes spread all over the minibar was quiet exhaustive and included in our price and was a welcome addition
