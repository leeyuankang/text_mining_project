absolutely marvelous building huge rooms and rambling corridors loved the art deco feel the staff were kind and helpful a pity there was building work going on outside but after complaining about the noise we were moved to the other side with no problems the hotel was an easy walk from the train station and we enjoyed the market square of nieuwmarkt which was also very close
