i found the room was very dusty there was a bottle cap under my bed i found some of the staff to be dismissive when i complained the shower door did not close i had to ask twice for it to be fixed the tv did not work in my room and at breakfast there were cups with chips gone off the side the selection of food for breakfast was cheap and average i certainly do not rate this hotel as a star star and that is being generous i would not spend my money again to stay at that hotel lisa michelle ryder
