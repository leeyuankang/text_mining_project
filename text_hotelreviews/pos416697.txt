we really enjoyed our stay here its a very nice older building we stayed in a very nice room with a kingsize poster bed overlooking the canal its a good location minutes from the train station all the staff were friendly and attentive the wellness center was great we had a nice massage when we arrived they have a nice steam room sauna and very nice pool we enjoyed a three course meal in there restaurant the breakfast was very good and included many items and the free mini bar was a bonus we would stay again anytime in amsterdam
