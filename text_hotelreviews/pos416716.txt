what a fascinating hotel amazing historic architecture and d cor this is truly a unique property that needs to be experienced it even has an old paternoster lift only works for demonstrations though the location is excellent particularly if you come by train as it is very close to amsterdam central station the room while old was comfortable and quiet you can even open a window wi fi was good the room service salads were excellent too
