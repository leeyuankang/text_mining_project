perfect location very interesting and historical building and very different from the average hotel across the road from the train station fantastic view from our room on the top floor lovely bathroom with perfect lighting a shame not all hotels manage this although the door was glass which may not suit everyone beautiful soft pillows were supplied on request and very comfortable bed good facilities in the room
