we stayed for nights in september before we boarded our river cruise we used booking com and our room price was amazing i had booked it almost year out knowing the dates i would be there so the early bird does get the worm i had checked many times but could never come close in price staff was always wonderful we came in about after an overnight flight and were so welcomed our room was not ready but were offered a glass of cold fruit infused water by peter who was so pleasant so sorry his mom passed during our stay he waited while we removed a few things from our bags and put them away for safe keeping we returned early afternoon and our room was ready with a canal view the room was a bit warm and the requested fan arrived as the trip was a birthday celebration a lovely tray arrived with champagne as we settled in i loved the location there are lots of little restaurants nearby to choose from amsterdam is great walking city so nothing seemed far if one chose to take the train from the airport the train station is certainly not a bad walk we were meeting our cruise at the hilton doubletree and just walked over with our bags this hotel is an interesting building with history and character lovely stained glass our room was large had a nice big bathroom with a tub if one chose a minibar that was stocked with wine beer soda peanuts each day a coffee maker i would certainly not hesitate to return we did not eat here so i cannot comment on the restaurant
