we stayed in a superior room which was a great size for us with our year old son the ceilings were so high it made the room feel even bigger and not at all like other hotels i ve stayed in the hotel facilities were great particularly the swimming pool which we used every day of our stay location wise we were just a few minutes walk from the station with plenty of places to visit and eat at within v easy walking distance
