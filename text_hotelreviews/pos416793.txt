this hotel is the best hotel i have ever stayed in the staff were friendly and efficient the pool and wellness centre were amazing and the room was the biggest hotel room i have seen i couldn t fault this hotel the free mini bar was a lovely touch as you don t have to worry about what it was going to cost on check out the bath might as well have been a swimming pool it was so big the breakfast variety was seriously impressive i will be returning to this hotel and bringing people with me to experience the beauty of the place
