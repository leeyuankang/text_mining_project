beautiful room very high ceiling which gives a nice feeling of space and luxury free minibar with loads of nespresso caps and outstanding tea bags loads of cold drink and also beer and white wine red wine beer that was a great surprise overall i liked the hotel and i got a very good deal so even though i think there s quite a few things that can be improved and i would still recommend the hotel but please have somebody available at reception and improve breakfast quality we want quality before variety and quantity it s a five star hotel
