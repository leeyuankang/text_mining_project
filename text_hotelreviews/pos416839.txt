super location staff in the guest relation are really nice and helpful i ordered two superior deluxe rooms but found the both sights ouside the window are wall on the website the hotel promise even a deluxe room which can overlook a historical canal or the cityscape along the ij waterway so the first day i was so angry and the heating radiator in the bathroom is too noisy and i was waked at am and cannot sleep any more as a result i wrote a feedback to the hotel in the midnight next day a lady from guest relation contacted me in the morning and helped me to change the room at once of course i slept much better in the second day mini bar is free
