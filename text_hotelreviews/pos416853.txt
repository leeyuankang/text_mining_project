big bathroom with his and hers sinks and a bath big enough for two also the bed was very comfy great location close to the station it was raining when we arrived by we were greeted by one of the hotel porters holding an umbrella great service and complimentary minibar is very nice touch the wellness centre is bigger than anticipated with a nice jacuzzi for a long soak after the long day walking all around but it s all the small touches that set this hotel apart from other like the free maps the turndown service the minibar the umbrellas the bathroom toiletries and many more
