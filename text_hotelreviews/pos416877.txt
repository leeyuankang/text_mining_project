this is a lovely hotel the location is excellent staff good and the glass walls are delightful the swimming pool with infinity jet at one end was great exercise very warm and quiet when we used it then a relax in the jaccuzi the free mini bar is also a nice touch we loved the curtains that shut with a remote button
