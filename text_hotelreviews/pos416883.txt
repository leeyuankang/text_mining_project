the hotel is beautiful a with a tangible dutch history throughout the staff are friendly andeager to help and when we raised an issue that we were not happy with it was dealt with it in an efficient and generous manner the facilities are excellent and all included in the price it is a pet hate of mine to have to pay extra for wifi euros per day at the renaissance and this is also included we will be back for christmas shopping in december if not sooner
