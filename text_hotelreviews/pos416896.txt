the hotel is beautiful very old worldly but with so many modern aspects eg restaurant bar bathroom check in was very personal and efficient our room was out of the way large with high ceilings a spacious bathroom the beds were really comfy the staff were extreme helpful polite and good humoured we thoroughly enjoyed our stay would stay here again in the future unfortunately we didn t have time to make use of the spa this time
