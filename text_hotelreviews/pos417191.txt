one of the absolute nicest hotels i have ever stayed in from the staff to the style and the luxurious and very sexy rooms the hotel exceeding my expectations in every category i was a apprehensive of the location so close to central station but that also turned out to be a great feature the hotel feels brand new it s perfectly maintained and has a very playful spirit the best part is the actual room super luxe details lighting and high ceilings it did not feel like a hotel more likes staying in a luxury apartment breakfast also terrific gym is large for a hotel gym too and there is an indoor pool a great stay for nights
