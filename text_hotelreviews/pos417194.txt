we loved the look of the hotel very stylish and artistic rooms were absolutely stunning finished to high standard and were spacious train station was just across the road close proximity to attractions however if you wanted to go to the quieter districts which we did such as jordaan and de pijp these were only a minute walk away here you could sit out at a cafe and watch the world pass you by
