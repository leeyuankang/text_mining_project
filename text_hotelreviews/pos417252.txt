i arrived late at night and the journey from the station to the hotel was very easy the staff were lovely and welcoming my room was very large absolutely stunning and well equipped there was a hour swimming pool but unfortunately i left my kit at home breakfast was a combination of warm a la carte dishes and breakfast buffet this was all clearly fresh and very nice
