overall this is a great hotel good location close to the centraal and many attraction the staff is very nice and even prepares a packed breakfast for us to enjoy on the train the bed and linen are good and it s quiet highly recommended to anyone travelling as a couple and want something extra and artsy the breakfast they offered at hotel is well worth the money
