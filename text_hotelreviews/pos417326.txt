don t let the quirky decor of this hotel make you think the service won t be good the staff were all excellent you get a warm reception every time you go in and in the restaurant the team are very friendly and attentive rooms are large and well equipped although the l double bed singles pushed together with separate quilts isn t particularly romantic free bathroom supplies are elemis and they top them up every day and leave you little samples of other stuff at turn down time breakfast is excellent with a very wide range of choice and tea coffee and the cooked elements are made to order and served at your table location is very good only about metres from the station which itself is only mins by train from the airport so getting to it and finding it is easy
