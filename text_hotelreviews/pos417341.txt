the very friendly staff very good vibes good food at the restaurant and the location is bang on one of the best the rooms are very spacious not the kind of cramped rooms u get in other hotels they had everything in the room from free chips to coffee i would rate this hotel the best out of the hotels i have stayed in amsterdam stayed here for four nights in the end the interiors of the hotel is sure one of the best
