staff were excellent especially the reception staff we arrived about hours prior to our check in time but were still allowed to check in as the room was ready couldn t have asked for any more smart tv s in the room first hotel i ve been to which had this really nice touch the deluxe room as a whole was absolutely gorgeous and the massage bath itself makes the price worth it
