staff were delightful and clearly upset by our experience they all knew and were extra nice manager on duty wrote personal letter immediately and made sure to chat with us on departure he also told us that the staff were unhappy with the group which was an experiment for a boutique hotel hopefully not to be repeated otherwise this hotel will not last long in its niche breakfast was terrific with outstanding home made cereal and freshly made hot food of high quality second room was very nice with great bathroom and large enough for a city hotel don t expect views as most rooms are internal whic makes them quiet really quiet at night excellent coffee machine and a kettle and free water and crisps made it feel generous location is very convenient for main station and trams
