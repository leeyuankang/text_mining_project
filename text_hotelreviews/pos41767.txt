i stayed at the bryson for the first time as it has been recently opened everything is brand new the soft carpet the beds really comfortable and definitely for london a very unusual size of rooms and bathrooms with windows buffet breakfast is served in the restaurant with a great variety of products and a very friendly team is just looking after you all the time very central located you can reach the office in the city very quickly and at the same time with the central line you can start your shopping on the high street
