this hotel is located about meters from the central station and is just meters from the canals and red light district the area is packed with good restaurants and bars we are regular visitors to amsterdam and our first preference of hotel is the barbizon palace the hotel is welcoming clean efficient check in and well located for the tourist it is perhaps a little too expensive at times of the year
