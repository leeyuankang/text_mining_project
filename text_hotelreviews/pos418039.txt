its a nice looking hotel with professional staffs the hotel has a nice seating area in the lobby they give welcome pack for kids cute eating utensils per kid which i really appreciate as it turns out very useful the room is looking nice and modern clean and comfortable we got free of charge extra bed for our kid which makes its value for money the space is just enough for european standard location is good as surround the hotel you can find restaurants its walking distance from amsterdam centraal station however you will pass highways so it may not be too comfortable taking big luggage from station by walking
