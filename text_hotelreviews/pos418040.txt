we had difficulties booking due to credit card issues the hotel sorted things out the hotel made us guest of the day on arrival so we had a room upgrade to a slightly bigger size and free breakfast voucher so that was a good start a bright and breezy guest relations manager seemed genuinely keen to make useful welcome and took us personally the to the room some evening s brought around a cookie or chocolate etc a heated towel rail that actually works the shower looks a bit dark but there is a separate light switch just inside the door and once you find that its bright enough wifi provided very helpful friendly staff we also ate at their sister hotel the krasnapolsky white room michelin star restaurant and that further reinforced our favourable opinion of this hotel chain excellent choice and quality at breakfast very accommodating on check out to leaving luggage to be collected later etc
