the hotel s location was great the staff was very polite and helpful to many touristic locations it was only a walking distance we used the public transport only for visiting the museum district where rijk museum and van gogh museum are located the room was very neat and modern the bathroom was clean the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was great with many options if the price is ok for you it s a great place to stay when you re in amsterdam
