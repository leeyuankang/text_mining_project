it was great value for money for the nights i have stayed during valentine as the rate are higher later on like all amesterdam hotels the location is super great a smart point to start your journey i recommend the uperfloor as you will see the tailes if you have not booked your room with view it is not a big deal as you will see the view from the elevator since his walls are from glass
