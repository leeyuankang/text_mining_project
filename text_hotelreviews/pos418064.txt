the hotel was a minute walk from the station you can see it as you come out of the front of the station and you can walk pretty much everywhere in the centre the boats stop really close by so we got one home the pillows were really comfy it s not a cosy boutique but it was brilliant for a weekend away tip house of bols was a really fun way to spend an hour or so
