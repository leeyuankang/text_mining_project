i love that the rooms are bright with a modern design while still being cosy great to have a hotel that refrains from putting carpets in the rooms so its spotless clean it was superb to have a little working station table in the room to work the location is top notch right next to the train station i travel a lot for work and seen many hotels so im happy to say id stay here again
