excellent breakfast at this nh hotel near amsterdam main station hotel is modern even if situated in an old building rooms comfortable bathroom clean and staff overall fairly efficient and helpful recommended for shorter stays where quick access in and out is priority unfortunately the on site restaurant was fully booked so cant comment here
