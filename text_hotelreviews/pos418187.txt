i liked everything about this hotel the location was excellent as it is only a minute walk from the central station i walked through the main doors into a beautiful looking lobby and when i checked in at the front desk the staff were very polite and helpful when i first entered my room i was blown away it was absolutely stunning with a huge stylish bathroom the bathroom had everything i needed and the shower was brilliant the bed was also huge and extremely comfortable but the best thing about the room was how clean it was everything was so clean and fresh and the over all finish to the room was just stunning i am returning to this hotel and i would strongly recommend it to others
