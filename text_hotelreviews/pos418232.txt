me and my boyfriend stayed here for the weekend and really couldn t fault a thing the hotel is in perfect location for everything and the staff couldn t have been more friendly if they tried we didn t eat here as it was a bit pricy for what we were after but there are so many places down the side streets it really wasn t an issue
