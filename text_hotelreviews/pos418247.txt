this was the best hotel we have stayed in our month of travelling in europe it was renovated in may and the rooms and the bathrooms were very modern and glamorous the breakfast was superb and the staff were very helpful special mention should be given to the cleaner of our room who chased me down the street with my reading glasses i had left under the bed
