the hotel took into account all our needs especially when we had a sick child traveling along the chef came out to enquire how he could cook the food it was very kind of them to move our friends into a hotel apartments so that they could cook for the child over all they went the extra mile and we thank you for it it was my stay at the barbizon palace and you guys didn t disappoint as usual
