i picked this hotel because when i was checking booking com deal of the day offer is this hotel the hotel is currently renovating the upper floor that is why they couldn t give us a room on that side so they gave us a room on the ground floor the receptionist is friendly and helpful there s a few steps of stairs to go to the bathroom wifi is good connection restaurants are just nearby
