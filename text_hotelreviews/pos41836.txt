the staff were always very polite we especially enjoyed the company of a very kind man who ran breakfast while we were there i think the location of this hotel is great there s a grocery store just next door which was incredibly convenient when we arrived since we were exhausted from traveling just down the street is the arc de triomphe and from there you can just turn onto the champs elys es public transportation is a super viable option here because there s a metro station just around the block the room was pleasantly small and cozy soft sheets and towels good toiletries provided the safe was spacious enough for us to store two laptops and a few more items
