the deluxe suite was fantastic with a lovely duplex feel to it the location of the hotel close to arc de triumph and the wagram metro is very convenient the staff was also very helpful and eager to make our stay in paris happy and comfortable we got great discounts through booking com and that made it good value for money although the hotel s rack rates seem exhorbitant
