we loved pretty much everything location staff and the facilities the hotel is just min walk from arc de triomphe we were upgraded to a deluxe room they don t provide a kettle in the room but we asked for a kettle as i need my tea the staff was kind enough to provide one when we asked they do keep a nespresso coffee machine in the room which is a nice touch
