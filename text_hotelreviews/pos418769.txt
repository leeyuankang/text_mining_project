this unusual luxury hotel was a pleasant surprise with an interesting history the initial room booked was not large enough for all our luggage and it did not have a canal view for which we had asked on paying an extra euro per day my husband and i then had everything we could want the various courtyards where one could sit drink eat were very nice indeed
