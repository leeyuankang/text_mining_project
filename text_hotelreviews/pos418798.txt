our room was huge and had a beautiful bathroom with lelabo products the hotel has an unusual quirky layout due to it consisting of a whole block of typical amsterdam canal buildings this made for an interesting stay though we did get lost a few times very friendly staff great breakfasts what more could you want we managed to walk everywhere too as the location is very central a lovely location to be based
