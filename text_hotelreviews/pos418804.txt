this hotel is unbelievable they took the charm and warmth of century homes and seamlessly connected them then they modernized them perfectly and added in all the luxuries of a star hotel as i explored this stunning hotel i discovered beautiful little nooks and crannies around every corner i highly recommend a visit to the pulitzer bar it has a chic speakeasy vibe and is perfect for a hand crafted cocktail i really liked the paloma cocktail and went back for it several times during my stay the cafe and restaurant are also fantastic the location is also wonderful as everything is so convenient to walk to and also gives you the authentic amsterdam feeling the outdoor space at the hotel is really enjoyable as well i seriously loved every single thing about this hotel and would love to stay there again
