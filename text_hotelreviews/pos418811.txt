hotel was recommended to us by friends who live in amsterdam and what a wonderful recommendation it was the location is fantastic and within walking distance of most tourist attractions we stayed in a room with a view of the canal which is definitely worth the extra money the size of our room and bathroom were great and special mention must be made of the shower which was fantastic it was big and roomy with an amazing shower head the decor is great and the attention to detail impressive all the staff were polite and extremely helpful i highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again
