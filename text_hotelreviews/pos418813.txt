the rooms were extremely comfortable and well serviced the staff could not have done more to ensure our stay was a great one everyone was extremely helpful and friendly we didn t eat in their main restaurant but the breakfast was excellent and their hour food and drinks bar served delicious snacks and lunches which we enjoyed on two occasions
