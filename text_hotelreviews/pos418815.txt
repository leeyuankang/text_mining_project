location of the pulitzer is perfect the staff everywhere in at the hotel are wonderful interested and responsive the aesthetic is lovely the bar is a relaxing cool place to while away a few hours down time the food is great at janz and our boat trip on the tourist was special not least being the envy of all the larger boats meandering around the canals
