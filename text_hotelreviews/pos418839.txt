loved this hotel very classy hotel in a very nice neighborhood the room was a bit on the smaller side but still very comfortable the gym was much bigger than we expected and was a godsend in the frigid amsterdam winter as we were able to avoid running outside we took the hotel s boat for a canal cruise it costs euros per person but is worth the extra cost
