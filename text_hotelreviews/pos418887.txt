location was excellent so centrally located and in front of a main canal had breakfast every morning in the hotel because the food was so good hotel just recently renovated so rooms were so nice even if they were quite small the lobby was just adorable and the outdoor caf in the courtyard was so pretty everyone was so friendly and helpful from the wonderful lady serving us during breakfast every morning to the doormen who helped us arrange our transfers
