the hotel staff are extremely welcoming cheerful and helpful the hotel is stunningly beautiful and located i loved the flowers at the entrance the gardens and outdoor areas are very pleasant and surprisingly expansive for a city like amsterdam where space is generally tight my room was very comfortable and appealing and had lots of little extras like complimentary biscuits tea and coffee bike repair kits and proper coat hangers it s by far the best hotel in which i ve ever stayed on my many visits to amsterdam
