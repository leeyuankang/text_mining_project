loved everything about this hotel it was recently renovated in august its set in a beautiful area in the nine streets we were close to all the trendy shops and cafes we stayed in a queen size room at first we were given a somewhat small room and when we brought it up to reception they were so helpful in moving us to a bigger room in the same category a special thank you to emanuela from reception for her help the bedroom design was lovely
