the hotel was amazing except for the fact they had a private function on the saturday evening our room was directly above and the base from the music was vibrating on the bedroom floor when we complained at apologies were given but nothing could be done until the function finished at however when we complained again the next morning we were then offered a visitors up grade to the members lounge this was the only criticism of the hotel the hotel staff are very pleasant and friendly we will stay there again
