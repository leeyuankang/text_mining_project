the room was spacious with two comfortable double beds and a small balcony huge tv good wifi the shower was excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful except for the room delivery boy who was fed up by the fact that he didn t get a personal tip in addition to the obligatory pound service fee that i had to pay the gym was nice and had very flexible opening hours i was impressed by the way the hotel kindly remembered my birthday celebration thank you very much
