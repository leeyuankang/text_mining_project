the rooms are big you have everything you need alber hijn is very close which you can buy whatever you need many restaurants and dessert shops just opposite to the hotel very friendly staff requested halal food and got some turkey chicken we were lucky and got a canal view good typical breakfast would recommend trying it once and then consider if it s worth it
