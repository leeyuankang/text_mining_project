the location is excellent you can easily reach the place with public transportation from schipol it takes less than from centraal station app all interesting places are actually in a walking distance and if you would like to party the best clubs are within walk the room was spacious and comfortable we stayed on the floor with a street view but still it wasn t noisy breakfast is really good overall we enjoyed our stay and we are satisfied with the level of comfort provided
