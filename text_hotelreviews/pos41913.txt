we were in a newly refurbished room spacious double beds which were very comfy large tv food was amazing pool sauna and steam room very nice and we were able to chill out on the loungers most staff very attentive some a little difficult possibly due to language barrier all in all a fabulous stay and i would definitely book this hotel again and as i m a hotel snob that s a very positive feedback
