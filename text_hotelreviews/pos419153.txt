location is excellent even though our room was not technically canal facing we could see it and we had a super tiny balcony which we thoroughly enjoyed the staff is absolutely amazing they made us feel very welcome and comfortable i highly recommend this place amsterdam is all about location you need to be in the heart of things to get the most out of it
