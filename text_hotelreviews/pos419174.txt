fabulous location tram right outside the hotel and cheap to get bus from airport to minutes from hotel beautifully decorated inside and out lots of restaurants nearby next to beautiful houses and area staff are so helpful rooms are bigger than expected lots of walking space and cleaned every day great additional extras like gym and ice machine quiet inside hotel also the hotel made our stay even more incredible and great value for money i will definitely be staying here again if im ever in amsterdam and will be recommending it to all out of
