location was amazing tram at the door which takes you to everywhere you want there is a tourist activity booking centre across the road which helped us decide on what to do and where to go in amsterdam the staff were very friendly courteous and attentive to our needs although the in room dining menu didn t have a big variety of food it had enough tasty dishes to try there were many restaurants bars and cafes around the hotel which made it easily accessible it was a great pleasure to stay at this hotel as it has exceeded our expectations
