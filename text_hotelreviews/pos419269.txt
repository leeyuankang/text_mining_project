as i stayed only about hours it is somewhat difficult to sya what is good and what is not good after i rather turbulent day for me it was great to find yourself in a cosy hotel room able to relax and get som well deserved rest a god breakfast to start the new day off re energized me and turned the visit to amsterdam to something of an overall positive experience
