the room was large compared to european hotels in this price range and clean the staff was very friendly helpful and spoke excellent english the location is hard to beat there s a tram stop literally right out of the front door the line it s on places you about equidistant between the museum district and the central station plus if you drive to amsterdam as we did there s a parking garage a little over a block away it s a bit pricey day but if you re just there for a few days it s a secure parking spot and one of the best points of this location there s a great little bakery right across the street the sausage rolls were our daily breakfast in fact even if you don t choose this hotel make a trip to the bakery as for us we d likely stay here again on our next trip to amsterdam
