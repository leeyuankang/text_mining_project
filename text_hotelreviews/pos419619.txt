the staff was very helpful and attentive whenever we would stop to ask questions in the lobby they would offer information water bottles and coffee the location is outstanding and our view of the canal made our visit that much more special very easy to walk to many locations including the museums the food is wonderful and the included breakfast was generous we really loved our visit and would absolutely come back
