my husband and i recently spent a few nights here on our first ever trip to amsterdam suffice it to say the andaz is a gorgeous hotel from the location to the staff to the room everything was near perfection front desk was throughly polite and helpful concierge even took the time out to suggest where to go and what to see with the city s obsession with cycling we were pleasantly surprised to learn of the hotel s free bike rentals room itself was nice if not a tad quirky will admit however that the bathroom situation was a bit awkward however as the sink was located inside the room while that was strange the only real downside was that the mirror wasn t above the sink a particular inconvenience for men who need to shave instead positioned to the side otherwise the room was extremely comfortable mini bar was well equipped with complimentary water and juices library downstairs near the lobby was also stocked with complimentary water juices and snacks for guests could help themselves all in all the andaz is definitely recommended especially for those visiting amsterdam for the first time
