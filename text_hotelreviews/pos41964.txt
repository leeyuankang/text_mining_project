staff were genuinely warm and couldn t do enough for us and made us feel very welcome the hotel was very well sited being only a minute walk from the jubilee line everywhere we wanted to go was accessible off the jubilee line so no tube navigation issues we parked at stanmore and caught the tube from there and checked into the hotel minutes later with no line changes ideal if you have a young family with you
