fantastic location couldn t have been better on one of the prettier canals in a quiet area tram station mins walk most interesting locations within walking distance overall very comfortable nice lounges great view from the room we had a canal view room excellent breakfast though very expensive whether you went for the buffet or for the full breakfast eur for a boiled egg in the end i think the buffet is the best option
