carluccio s is a big bonus to the place the breakfast was excellent that scrambled egg i unfortunately came down with flu whilst there having booked it because of the pool that said it was even great without it staff lovely atmosphere in the place light and airy and friendly location excellent there really were no negatives other than minor no toothpaste in rooms no slippers and dressing gown unless requested paucity of shower gel etc advised when i queried that they only replace if less than how can two people shower with of a mini bottle only a blip and when i queried was sorted all in all and i am fairly critical a superb hotel
