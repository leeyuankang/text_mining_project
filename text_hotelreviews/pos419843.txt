i liked the quirky features such as the messages to guests the pictures and the artwork the staff were all helpful friendly and available throughout my stay loved the ipad controlling the room loved the really relevant and useful literature in the room which was invaluable in helping us find our way around amsterdam and we took advantage of your restaurant recommendations thank you
