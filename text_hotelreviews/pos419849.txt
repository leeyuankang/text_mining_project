bed was so comfy and huge overall the room was pretty great controlling it with an ipad was quite nifty toilet and shower being in the room didn t faze us at all there s a curtain that can be drawn across that area if you re a bit shy staff were really friendly helpful too loved the whole concept of the place brilliant literature and art all around you bar clever incentive to help the environment couldn t really recommend the place more tram stop was just outside tram ride to city centre but takes almost half an hour i think that s the only slight negative i can think of just fantastic will definitely be back
