lovely concept fresh modern and interesting the hotel is very close to the train station as well as to the tram station making it easy to get to all the city s attractions nice rich breakfast staff extremely helpful and kind loved how they encourage being eco by giving away vouchers for the bar in case you don t need to have the room cleaned
