very different and modern hotel gives that amsterdam feel the lights tv curtains etc can be controlled via ipad which i found very cool there were also mood lights in the room the bed was nice and comfy the positioning of the shower and toilet in the room is a little weird but the shower was really really good the location is also good there is a tram stop right next to the hotel from where you could reach the city center in the airport is also very easily reachable via train
