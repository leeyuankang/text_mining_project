this is a good place to stay very modern in designs and make you recharge yourself well it s quite expensive for my budget trip but compare to the other hotel in ams this is a proper place for me it s close to zuid station just minutes walk if you don t get lost there is a tram stop like meters from the hotel so it s another direct way to get into the city the bed is soooo big and comfy i don t want to get up
