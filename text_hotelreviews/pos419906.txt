the staff are terrific friendly and helpful the bed is big and incredibly comfortable the room is on the small side but it s designed in such a way that we never felt like we were cramped the breakfast was a respectable buffet that s a little on the pricey side but convenient and tasty the shower was very nice having a tram stop just down the block made it very easy to get to the places we wanted to go
