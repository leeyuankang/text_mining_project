this hotel was brilliant very modern and extremely well designed i stayed here with my boyfriend for nights saturday tuesday i spent the weekend thinking this hotel was too good to be true and was wondering what the catch was but there wasn t any check in out and room was very high tech check in out was all self service and members of staff are available should you need help shower and toilet were in pods within the bedroom but this was far from a problem there was also a curtain which split the room in half so that the bathroom pods were separated from the bed which we didnt need to use as the glass in the toilet pod is frosted and not see through might be slightly awkward if you re not traveling with your partner or close family memebers but the curtain would help in that case biggest bed i have ever seen wall to wall next to a huge window free movies some of which were very new and international tv channels were also available which was greatly appreciated room is controlled with an ipad which is a cool gimmick for those who have never experienced something like that it also means that the whole room can be controlled and you don t even have to stand up room and hotel decor was very modern with excellent use of space from reading other reviews prior to my stay i was expecting a much smaller room than what i got facilities were very modern including a large rain shower and automatic blackout blinds mood lighting and a large flatscreen tv above bed room also has an easy to use safe location was ideal the tram stop is much closer than i expected and as we got a day pass available to purchase at hotel for approx euros we could come and go as we pleased tram was about minutes to city center with many stops at landmarks along the way also the hotel is a very short walk from the train station amsterdam zuid station which meant that getting from schipol airport to citizen m was very easy
