the bed was giant and quite comfortable the room is unique as you can tell from the online photos very high tech and customizable it was really nice to be able to adjust the lights including with colors and make it comfortable and suitable for work vs relaxing vs waking up i was worried the shower would leak into the room since this is a problem with so many hotel showers and especially since this shower was so different but i am pleased to say it did not leak at all it was a really nice shower and i liked that you had an option to use the handheld shower head or the rain shower the wifi was fast and easy to connect to the hotel is a short walk from the amsterdam zuid station very convenient it is also technically within walking distance of the rai but the trek is much longer than the minutes the hotel claims it to be especially if you have luggage heavy things to carry or are wearing high heels tip bring comfortable shoes for the walk amsterdam zuid oud zuid area is not so happening but it s got plenty to offer and is relaxed and much more serene than your typical city center type amsterdam visit
