i really liked the futuristic vibe of the hotel this was definitely one of the most interesting hotels that i have ever stayed at the bed was super comfortable and the shower was really cool rain shower in the middle of the room lit up by colorful lights however what really impressed me about the hotel was the staff they were so friendly and helpful and they made our stay really enjoyable
