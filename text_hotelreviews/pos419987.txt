excellent hotel for business or if you are looking for a good level of comfort for reasonable price very modern and keen on domotica everything you need to work internet printer common pc s and a large bed to relax the rooms are small rooms but they do not feel small eye for design and functionality everything is done in purpose of function highly recommendable
