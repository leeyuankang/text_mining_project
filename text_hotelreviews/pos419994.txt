i thought the hotel was lovely but the food wasn t great and a didnt really feel like we had a lot of choice for breakfast i was going to add it on to my package at the hotel when i arrived but when i seen what they had to offer i didn t think it was great there also isn t very much to do around the hotel hardly any shops and the shops that were around closed early i feel the hotel would have been suited much better to me if if was closer to the city centre but i did enjoy my stay and the room was lovely
