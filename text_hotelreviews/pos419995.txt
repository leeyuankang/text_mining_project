hotel is located one train stop away from the airport it is not that close to city center but consider it a chance to see more of amsterdam while walking or biking great public transportation is also available just use google maps for the fastest route check in is automated via computers in the lobby you pay at check in only by card the rooms are clearly designed for couples the shower and toilet are in the middle of the room in transparent shower and semi opaque toilet glass cylinders entire room is controlled via an ipad including tv lights ambient lights window curtains the bed is huuuge and it s amazing overall the room has a great vibe if you want something different than your standard hotel this is the perfect place
