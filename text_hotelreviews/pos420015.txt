excellent variety of vegan food options and good coffee super helpful friendly yet non intrusive staff technology in the room worked seamlessly the option to get a eur voucher night if you don t need your room cleaned was great for a business traveller that hardly spends time in the room anyway quiet i chose a top floor garden view room
