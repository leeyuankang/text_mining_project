the bed is incredible it s at least by meters and very comfortable the shower is awesome they have improved the breakfast experience a lot you have everything you would expect i like the intelligent room control with an ipad all the settings worked the tv is very large and offers nice channels and movies for free the canteen is pretty cool offers basically everything you would need and a decent coffee not like most hotels the common area is spacious and relaxing the staff is friendly and helpful great people work there the location is very practical you have a train and metro station near by as well as bus and tram stops i would surely recommend this for any business traveler but please keep in mind you need to be a bit twisted to accept all the design decisions
