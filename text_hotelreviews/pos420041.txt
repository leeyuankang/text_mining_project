the staff are incredibly helpful and it was great to be able to buy tram passes at the hotel i like the concept of the hotel and the rooms although you d have to be comfortable with limited privacy breakfast was reasonably well stocked for the price the hotel is well located for public transport which will get you to the city centre and to the airport quickly and cheaply
