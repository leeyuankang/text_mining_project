i loved the location you can catch a number tram pretty much outside the hotel into central takes mins roughly zuid train station is minute walk from hotel and one stop from airport which is great free wifi free good movies biggest bed very comfy can get food drink they don t just say that there is someone ready to make you a coffee at if you wish they also give you a voucher to spend in canteen if you choose not to have your room cleaned that day which is a nice touch
