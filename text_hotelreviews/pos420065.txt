the hotel was immaculate lovely lobby bar rooms and even our view wasn t so bad loved the ipad that enabled us to change the mood lighting of our rooms and the automatic blind free movies was an added bonus the staff were attentive and always on hand to help for example when the free printer ran out of ink they were quick to help out and printed off my documents for me very easy to get into the centre of amsterdam from the hotel and did you re not sure staff are easily accessible to get instructions from would definitely stay in this hotel if i visited this lovely city again
