this was the neatest hotel i ve ever stayed in so modern and absolutely perfect for a layover for a couple or if you just plan to sleep there which is what most travelers to a new city should do the beds are humongous the electronically controlled mood setting for the room and the black out curtain are exactly what a weary jet lagged traveler needs and this hotel caters to individual or couples perfectly
