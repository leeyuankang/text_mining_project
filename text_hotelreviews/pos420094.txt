the room was so much fun i loved the big bed the rainfall shower and the mood lighting for friends couples that are traveling together be warned there isn t much privacy in regards to showering using the toilet i was travelling on my own so it wasn t an issue for me the staff were really friendly breakfast was great and the snack options at the bar were awesome highly recommend for a sleek and different experience
