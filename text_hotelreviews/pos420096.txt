the staff were fantastically helpful and welcoming the hotel is located perfectly being just a minute walk from the train station for people to the airport instead of in a taxi and right next to metro line which takes you into the heart of amsterdam the room itself was clean and welcoming the personalization on the ipad room control and the tv was also a nice touch in short one of the best places i have ever stayed in
