the euro breakfasts may seem steep but they re filled with quality coffee pastries and smoked salmon the breakfast was a god send considering i was going to a music festival every morning the staff were extremely helpful and polite they were helpful in a friendly instead of clinical way they offer complimentary bikes were a nice touch get them early they get rented out quickly the beds were large firm and very comfortable the led showers and toilets are a nice touch but uh very intimate
