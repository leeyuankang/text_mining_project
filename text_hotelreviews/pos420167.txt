the room is really interesting and clean though the hotel is not really near to the city centre it still very convenient to the centre if you rent a bike from the hotel for free or take a no tram just in front of the hotel the staff there are quite enthusiastic and friendly especially my friend got some problems they showed concern to my friend and helped us to figure problems as well thanks for the help and understanding we really love the stay in the hotel
