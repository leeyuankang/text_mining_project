i don t normally write reviews but i had to take time to compliment the service i received at this hotel my friend and i came to amsterdam for a weekend to attend a concert out of all the accommodations i ve stayed at in amsterdam citezenm by far has been the best first of all the decor and layout of the hotel is superb using space very efficiently and keeping a very modern vibe going on across the whole hotel secondly the room is just so amazing the cylinder tube shower and toilet were so cute the bed was huge and comfortable and there was enough space for a safe coat hangers and a storage for the suitcases strong wifi accross the hotel was a bonus too which my friend desperately needed at times the mood lightings were my favourite part and being able to control the lights blinds tv and heating all from the tips of my fingers accross the provided ipad was just bliss the staff were all so polite each one of them always had a smile and acknowledged us whilst they walked past keeping contact to a minimal to prevent annoyance but with just the right amount of attention when we needed it even the cleaners were happy and you can t say that for many hotels i enjoyed my stay here and i would highly recommend to all my friends which i have started to do so already thank you citezenm
