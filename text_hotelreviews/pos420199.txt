i loved the sleekness of checking in yourself as long as u were ok with technology and that our rooms were already ready before the cocktail bar was fab for coffees in the morning and lovely cocktails at night it was fresh and vibrant and a few times we bought a croissant to go which was lovely and ideal for us to be able to do that with a busy day planned beds also extremely comfy
