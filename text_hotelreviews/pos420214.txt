funky and fun amazing beds great concept hotel ipad controls had the teenagers in raptures as did the enormous tv mood lighting open plan shower even the blinds are entertaining the staff are young and amazingly helpful the food is basic but what there is is well done i have put the location as good only because it is out from the centre however the tram system in amsterdam is fantastically efficient and has a stop right by the hotel very good value for money
