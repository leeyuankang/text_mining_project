i couldn t fault a single thing my boyfriend and i arrived in amsterdam on friday and the staff couldn t have been more welcoming or helpful the hotel was immaculate loved the quirky interior design we were very impressed with the room as it was a perfect size for a couple and loved that you could control everything from the mood lighting to the blinds and television through the ipad location is brilliant tram stop number was right outside our hotel which allows you to go all the way to centraal station and zuid station was a minute walk at the very most the worst part was having to check out not because it was stressful it was the easiest procedure of checking in and out that i have ever experienced but because we had to leave thank you for having us citizenm we will definitely be back in the near future
