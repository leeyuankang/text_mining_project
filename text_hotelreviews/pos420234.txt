the staff throughout our stay at the hotel were really friendly approachable and helpful couldn t fault any of them the rooms made a good use of the space with all modern amenities loved the funky mood lighting and the bed was amazingly big comfy the zuid train station is a minute walk away with a minute train journey to the airport catch the train from outside the hotel for a minute journey to some of the main tourist attractions within the city centre i would definitely recommend the hotel to others
