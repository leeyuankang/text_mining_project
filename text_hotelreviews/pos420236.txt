friendly service and cozy room full of thoughtful and playful details it was kind of mind blowing to have a room with tube like glass chambers for the toilet and shower it was a clever unusual detail that made a tiny room seem much bigger i also liked the big drawer under the bed easy to store clothes and various souvenir buys there having a small desk nearby to do work was very handy too the bed was super comfy and the room was quiet a welcome oasis after a hour flight from india very cool to have options for mood lighting and music controlled by the ipad near the bedstand breakfast and the downstairs cantina bar was excellent all you can eat scrambled eggs and roasted tomatoes bacon bread or granola and yogurt worth ordering ahead of time since they charge more if you just get it on the day of the open fridge with beers sodas and snacks was also a cut above and very convenient especially since it seemed like the next closest convenience store was at the amsterdam zuid station about a minute walk away the bar and the living room area was great for socializing and relaxing i felt hipper by staying at citizen m the hotel is conveniently located near the amsterdam zuid train and metro stations it s a quick one stop ride from the airport it was also a good home base when i did a day trip to s hertogenbosch the staff kindly took good care of my suitcases while i was off on my day trip and provided excellent friendly service every step of the way
