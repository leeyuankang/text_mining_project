the bed was one of the comfiest i have stayed in the check in out self service was a much easier way as opposed to the old fashioned way apple mac computers and printer to use for free of charge this was handy as we had boarding passes to print from the few dealings we had with staff they seemed really friendly also the steam room which was a self service ironing room was also really handy this is free to use overall i d say citizenm is really funky and cool hotel
