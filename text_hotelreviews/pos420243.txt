the location was great on a direct tram line number from the central station very easy to find the staff were really friendly and helpful there was a fun upbeat vibe around the hotel which felt energizing the rooms were fun with the colourful lighting and unusual layout the bed was comfortable and huge the pillows were as soft as advertised and the food was lush
