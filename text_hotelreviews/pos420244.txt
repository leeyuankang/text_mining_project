at first i was surprised by the room setting but the gadgets and the bed were really great and comfortable the fact that toilet was there in the room was a bit inconvenient because of the noise but the shower idea was good if you are going as a couple i think its fine i loved the room controls and the fact that you could also watch some movies that were not on tv also the fact that you could change lights based on different moods was also interesting the tram stop is really close and you can take number and it takes you to most tourit attractions museums and city centre
