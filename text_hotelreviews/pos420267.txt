the staff were wonderful it was my fianc s birthday and they wrote him a card and pinned balloons to our door we chatted for hours with them at the bar too the room was exactly what you need it was very clean and a great novelty using an ipad to control everything although the facilities were in tubes in the room you didn t feel conscious using them
