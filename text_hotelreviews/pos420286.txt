we had a great night stay in the citizenm the hotel s design is very modern and targeted at a younger crowd staff was super friendly and helpful with checking in rooms are very special and modern the bed is really big and comfortable you can manage everything in the room from an ipad they have a great selection of movies which you can watch the toilet and shower are kind of in the middle of the room and maybe for friends travelling together that could be a bit awkward in the beginning tram is right next to the building so it is super easy to get to the city center in
