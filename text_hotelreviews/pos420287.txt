i had experienced an open room concept once before but traveling solo so this time i was a bit skeptical however based on the good reviews we went ahead check in was piece of cake in the room everything is controlled by an ipad and that was an exciting surprise the bed is very comfortable and the room itself is thoroughly lighted bright very nice concept rooms are small but well organised wifi is free and you have access to hundreds of movies for free during your stay
