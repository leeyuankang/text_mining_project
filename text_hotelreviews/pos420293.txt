easy access to local transport very modern rooms and hotel we had some confusion over our check in which took a little longer than we anticipated to no fault of anyone s for this they compensated us with drinks on the house after we had settled in which started our night and holiday perfectly nice futuristic rooms hotel and definitely worth your money also included a microwave free of use if you had a night like us where you could warm up last nights take away friendly staff very cosy hotel perfect
