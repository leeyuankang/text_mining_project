great location for regent s park and london zoo handy underground parking but pricey reception and restaurant recently refurbished very nice carluccios super helpful friendly staff both on the phone and in person even with noisy kids floor rooms are due to be refurbished but whilst a bit dated were super clean and perfectly nice lovely bed outside of hotel is not very beautiful architecturally but aside from that a great stay at a decent price felt like everyone was really making an effort to achieve high standards we ll go back
