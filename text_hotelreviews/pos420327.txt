the design of this hotel is fab there is a very relaxed laid back vibe we loved the free movies the mood lights the apple tv in the bedroom we also loved the layout and design of the canteen bar lounge area and the music playing downstairs was really good when we checked in a staff member was extremely helpful she answered every question we had the cocktails are lovely and the staff are very friendly there are mac computers available to use and the wifi works perfectly
