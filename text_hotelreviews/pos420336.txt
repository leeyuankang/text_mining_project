over all concept of the hotel was just a breathe of fresh air like mostly everything good for solo travelers and couples but not for the family as the room s are built for not for more than persons bed is too comfy there is just one day that i over slept and lost the day already cause the entire mattress will suck you in for a good reason variety of breakfast was decent internet was fast advanced tv and room access via an ipad a first i m well traveled and stayed in so many star hotels but this one just puts it on the top fyi self service check in hotel
