this hotel is a great hotel very modern with excellent facilities the rooms are a great use of space and really comfortable and funky the staff are so helpful and friendly and it was refreshing to visit a hotel that was exactly if not better than what it said on the tin the distance from the centre of amsterdam is a nice enough distance to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre but close enough to jump a tram back at your convience i will certainly stay here again x
