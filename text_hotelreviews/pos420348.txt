my sister i brought my dad for his birthday he was really taken by the hotel he especially loved the massive bed we had breakfast here both mornings we all thought it was perfect the fresh bread being the highlight it has a lovely informal atmosphere and the staff are all friendly and helpful they are a young team but all with a great attitude to their job which is a breath of fresh air i will be interested to what the uk staff are like the as restaurant across the road is a must we went on the sunday evening when they have a special menu and we shared various plates of deliciousness which we thoroughly enjoyed dont be put off by the out if town location the tram service is excellent the stop literally opposite the hotel so travelling back forth to the center was no hassle
