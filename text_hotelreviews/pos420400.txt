i have to say while the citizenm chain is a bit different i like them the rooms are designed to maximize space while they are small they are very efficient and comfortable very large bed they have a very inviting common area on the floor level they also have free bikes to use to explore amsterdam with while the hotel isn t the most convenient for city center it is convenient to the zuid train station and right on the tram line which takes you right to city center and past the museum area so it is easy to get a day pass from the airport take a short ride on the train to the zuid station and hotel then hop a tram to pretty much anywhere else in the city you wish to go
