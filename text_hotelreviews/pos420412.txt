it was the coolest stay experience i had in a long time it was a new concept all together and it worked well from the check in out food and room layout all the staff were obviously well trained it was as if they new they are on to something new and they always seemed to be exited about working there well done i stayed directly afterwards in a traditional business hotel and it was absolutely boring
