i really enjoyed the quality of the food within the restaurant i thought it was of a high standard drinks were at a reasonable price also most importantly to help with the reason of my stay i was very impressed that upon my request at reception about wifi within my room the staff was able to help me without any extra cost added to my stay and was more than happy to do so all staff were very pleasant and happy each staff member said good morning good evening
