very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family the hotel has a inside garden beautiful english style where you feel relax with a glass of beer it s very close to the earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night we like this hotel
