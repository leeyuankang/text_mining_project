all of the staff we encountered were very friendly and attentive they could not have done more to make our stay memorable as we were celebrating a special occasion in addition the hotel itself was very well maintained with immaculate rooms and a stunning location a wide choice of options were served at breakfast and the evening meal we had in the brasserie was divine all in all a fantastic experience
