i only stayed one night and had to leave extremely early to the airport but even then the stay was really good and i wish i had more time the location is great if one wants to be near the beach otherwise it is quite far from all the classics barcelona itineraries however it is beautiful and in the summer especially it was a plus to be able to walk by the beach in the evening and have a nice run the hotel in itself is really nice
