absolutely loved our stay at attica i emailed the hotel many times leading up to our stay to confirm the few extras i had booked as a surprise for my husband and to also check payment methods etc they replied instantly and were very helpful therefore i have been very pleased with their communication fantastic location and the breakfast was absolutely delicious
