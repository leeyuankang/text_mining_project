the room was clean and they were able to easily accommodate a room change due to noise from an adjacent building it was also nice to have the little refreshment bar at the entrance of the hotel where you could have a quick glass of water or juice and grab an apple the nespresso in the room was nice but they could provide more than just three complementary capsules or maybe a kettle for tea pillows were particularly comfy the location was perfect for us and we could walk to practically everywhere
