i love this hotel very much casa mila casa batllo and many high rated restaurants are within walk distance pharmacy bakery bookstore and small supermarket are in neighbourhood the room is clean and quiet the cosy bed makes me sleep well every morning i could open the curtain and overlook the lovely crossroad from my window the staff are all very friendly every morning when i went out for sightseeing they would deliver greetings which made me stay in good mood especially francis at front desk i hope i spell his name correctly he is very friendly patient and responsible the trip in barcelona was great and the hotel made the trip greater
