had a brilliant time in barcelona staying at hotel america the staff are so friendly and are good for recommending places to eat and how to get to different places the room was immaculate on arrival and every day when it was made up unfortunately the roof top pool and bar area weren t open as it doesn t open til may however it was lovely and can imagine it to be very popular in hotter months
