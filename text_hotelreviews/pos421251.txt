really excellent hotel with a great location amazing rooms we had a free upgrade to a superior room which was very appreciated as the shower and bed were huge the roof terrace and pool were a lovely place to relax away from the busy streets and the staff couldn t do enough for us it was a nice touch that the terrace turned into a cocktail bar at night and was a good place to come back to after dinner to relax we will definitely be back
