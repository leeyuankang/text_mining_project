the hotel is great value for money for amsterdam as most properties in the center are very expensive it is approx ten mins from public transport to gaserplas station which will take you directly to the centre of amsterdam it is quiet and modern facilities the bed was extremely comfortable and the room had air conditioning and a good shower the room had beautiful view of the river with boats coming through each day in addition to a mini fridge in the room to store beverages which was cheaper for us regarding alcohol
