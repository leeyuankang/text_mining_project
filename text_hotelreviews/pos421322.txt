reception staff were very friendly and very helpful room was lovely and clean and a good size the only down side was that it is on the outskirts of amsterdam so costs quite a bit for a taxi from the train station to the hotel however it is easy to get into the centre of amsterdam a ten minute walk and a minute metro ride and you are there the plus side is that it is nice and quiet lovely park nearby to walk through as well
