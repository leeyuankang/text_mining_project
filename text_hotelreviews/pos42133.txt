the staff were brilliant very friendly and extremely helpful at one point during our stay my wife thought she had lost her handbag our fault not the hotel but the staff swung into action and searched high and low until we found it a very professional and friendly staff making all the difference to our stay thank you i also like the swimming pool it is a nice size and perfect for playing with young children
