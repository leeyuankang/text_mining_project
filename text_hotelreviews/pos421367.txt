i needed rest as my daughter was getting married and got married on the friday this was perfect the view over the canal the meadows and forest in the background sunrise and natural beauty was exactly what i needed to start my day as nature is my healer i did not make use of vacilities except for dinner once the salmon was delicious even though i was there from monday to sturday i found the staff could have been a little friendlier and made a little chat different to someone just there for a day however they where not unfriendly on asking to see the rooms if one comes with a pet as i have a dog i was unfortunenately not shown the room which is a pity after being there for days as this hotel is perfect from my daughter and so close to the meadows and forest for walks so it would have been nice to just have a look where the rooms are situated and what they look like was wonderful spacious bath and view super thankyou
