beds were really nice friendly staff and very helpful would definitely book a second time for my stay in amsterdam if you re concerned about how far the hotel is then maybe you shouldnt book in the first place its a bit hypocritical booking knowing where the hotel location is then saying its far away they put the address on the booking page and everything is very clear metro is minutes away and a bus stop is minutes away but the metro has fewer stops and no need to make a change along the way
