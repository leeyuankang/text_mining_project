the view was amazing something that really was exceptional was the service we had left behind something in our room and even though we realised only a day after we checked out the staff was able to recover it they even had an option to courier it back further whether it was last minute printouts guiding on routes wake up calls or booking a taxi all these small things added up to a great experience
