the staff made us feel extremely welcome and nothing was too much trouble even down to giving us a bottle opener or supplying us with extra towels we had a family room with two double beds which was plenty big enough and very comfortable the food in the restaurant was amazing and most staff were very helpful the spa facilities were very clean and very much needed after a hectic day around london also very good that they stayed open until teenage daughters certainly made us of the spa facilities again after we had dined
