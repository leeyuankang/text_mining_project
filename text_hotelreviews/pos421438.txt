lovely hotel too far from amsterdam central good transport links but if you just want to be where all the attractions of the city are then it s a bit too much out of the way hard to find at first once you know where it is it s ok off the highway and a bit scary walking back to it from metro in the dark no problem with the actual hotel just the location
