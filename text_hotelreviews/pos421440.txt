we had dinner at the hotel twice they have many different meals to choose from and the food quality is great the bed is very comfortable and the hotel has very beautiful rooms i liked the location of the hotel it s very outside of the city very quiet and comfortable and you re out of all the city noise for an introvert like me especially after smoking it was very positive to have a quiet area to rest at
