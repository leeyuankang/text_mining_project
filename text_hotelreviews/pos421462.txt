we upgraded to the honeymoon suite which was offered to us by the hotel for the week for extra and it was well worth it the front desk were very good with us the hotel is in a nice location next to the lake and the park and great for people who enjoy the scenery and little walks or cycling the hotel was clean and tidy and the dining space was quite large including a very nice outside area over looking the lake you could sit right on the lake edge which was a bonus the staff were very friendly and helped us to learn a little bit of dutch they were also very helpful with information about local shops and bike hire which are both handy enough there is a supermarket one metro stop away almost right outside the station you can buy a per person travel pass from any station machine for days or travel or varying prices for varying amount of days and travel on any tram metro or bus which is excellent the transport is very well maintained and regular as clockwork
