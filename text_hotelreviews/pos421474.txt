the room was comfortable clean spacious and felt quite luxurious especially the enormous and really comfortable bed the hotel s location is a little out of the city centre so it takes about mins by metro to get to the centre of amsteram we quite enjoyed the train ride and the fact that the area around the hotel was in a quieter less frantic area than the city center it made the hotel more relaxing we also very much enjoyed walking in the area around the hotel gaasperplas park is really close to the hotel and i would highly recommend going there on a sunny day for a picnic or a walk around the lake compared to the famous vondelpark which is always bustling with cyclists and people gaasperplas park is much quieter and idyllic and we actually found it more enjoyable to spend a day in we also found several smaller grassy areas near a residential area by the station where there were lots of rabbits this hotel is a good place to stay if you want somewhere more relaxing than amsterdam s crowded city centre yet still be close enough to the city to be able to get there easily this hotel definitely offers a very comfortable stay
