everything was of great quality we expected the bar minimum but no it was well beyond that of a base line hotel it was well decorated clean and we had a great view from our balcony there was no cheap skating like asking us to pay for every little thing we wanted like wifi when we had the food there was huge portions with prompt service and again high quality food for a reasonable price
