the staff were incredibly helpful and lovely i also loved the location despite being a small walk from the metro which i knew before booking it wasn t a hard walk and there was a huge park to go exploring in right next to the planetarium i loved my room too clean and well maintained the only issue i had was with the fan in the bathroom which i m not sure ever turned off but closing the door helped to muffle the sound
