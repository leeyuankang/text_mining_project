when we walked in the doors of the hotel we knew it was a great choice the photos here don t do it enough justice the price was amazing for the what we got the hotel looked lovely inside and i don t have a bad word to say about the rooms the bed was so comfortable and the view of the river was beautiful the hotel isn t central but there is a metro station just a ten minute walk away and a metro from there will take you straight to the centre the travel card we purchased from there sorted us for metro bus and tram travel in and around the centre for hours and only cost which is way less than even a one way taxi to the centre absolutely would go again
