very adequate and quiet room with everything required including tea coffee facilities and was better than we were expecting but note that this was the golden tulip riverside hotel with the rennovated rooms the tulip riverside hotel is actually in the same building with the same reception but the rooms here are not rennovated so make sure that your booking is in the golden tulip
