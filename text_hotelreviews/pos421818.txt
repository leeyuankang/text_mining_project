a very nice hotel in residential area with beautiful views from the roof top good quality very clean and crazy comfy beds located on a steep hill so be prepared it wasn t a problem for us min walk to the station and then a short journey on the train to get to the city centre the roof top area is an excellent option to relax with loungers and towels provided
