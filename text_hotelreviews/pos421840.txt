the personnel was extremely nice and helpful the bed super comfy the location is not bad at all despite the reviews i am a walker i have to admit but the underground station is minutes walk passeig de gracia or stops away nearby you have very nice bars for breakfast park guell is minutes walk away if you are fine with walking and climbing a bit don t be fooled by the reviews regarding the location it s convenient and in a nice area
