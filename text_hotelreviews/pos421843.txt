the staff were very helpful where possible see adverse comments on the room i would like to point out that i did mention the bathroom condition to reception and the lady did say she would bring it to the attention of the management but whilst i trusted her in what she said i am not convinced that the people further up the chain will be bothered to pursue the matter
