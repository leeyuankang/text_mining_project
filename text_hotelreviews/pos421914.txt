i enjoyed the terrace upgrade which is a nice area to lounge in if you are a little bit jet lagged and not quite ready to start the day the hotel is nested on the hills of gracia with great views of the city and ocean far from the loud tourist areas in the old city pla a catalunya but is located walking distance to park guell and to metro and bus stops the adjacent jardin del tur de putxet is lovely area for a morning or evening jog a short walk down the hills into vila de gracia allows access to great restaurants this area has fewer crowds and helps to appreciate the local catalan culture
