residential area where is the hotel is quite safe and cozy you don t feel city noise here coming to and from metro station takes just minutes so it s good and walking up the hill didn t scare neither us nor our parents we liked gracia district itself because it s quite close to the center but you can dine and spend time with locals escaping crowds of tourists
