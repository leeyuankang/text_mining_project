the hotel is set in a quiet street but very close to the lesseps metro station we stayed in a triple room however we didn t feel cramped and the beds were very comfy although we didn t use it we did check out the swimming pool up on the roof and whilst it is small it offers fantastic views across the city and there are plenty of sunbeds in the atrium and towels provided we had a meal from the snack bar the first evening which was good and cost on a par with restaurants outside of the hotel our daughter got excellent wifi reception in our room on the floor
