i liked the situation of the hotel as it was situated close to parc guell on the hill that affords the classic view of barcelona from the roof terrace and pool the staff were very friendly and helpful particularly when an item went missing from my room and left no stone unturned in their efforts to help me recover it shame that our efforts were in vain many thanks to romario eva pol and luis for their help and their kindness
