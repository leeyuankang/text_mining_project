we had just one night in london and the hotel s location let us make the most of it took the tube directly from heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the russell square tube station the next day it was an easy walk to st pancras station to catch the train to gatwick we spent our day in london eating shopping and visiting the british museum everything within extremely easy walking distance grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces it occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed stayed on a sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week charming doorman too
