the staff was excellent treated us like royality upon arrival we stayed at the w which had great views but was the price of this hotel we rented the apartment and there was so much room and a family room where we could all hang out as a family we had to have a suite and an extra room at the w the location of this hotel was central to everything we would stay here again and we are picky travelers there is a great place to eat around the corner pepito don t think twice just book you won t regret it
