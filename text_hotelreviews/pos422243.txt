we booked a two bedroom suite it is well decorated very comfortable and a bargain it felt like home as we enter from an individual gate meters from the main hotel gate the hotel is located near casa mila casa batilo and only minute walk from the subway station where a few lines meet so we can go to almost every tourist site without transfer
