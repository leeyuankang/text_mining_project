the staff were really friendly and helpful and even provided a special welcome as i was celebrating my birthday the room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed and lovely bathroom the interior of the hotel is lovely and the service was excellent we could leave our bags after we checked out we asked for an iron and it arrived within minutes etc the location is also great very central minutes from casa batllo and next to the metro
