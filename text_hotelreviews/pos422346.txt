we loved everything about the hotel they upgraded our room because we were celebrating our special birthday and anniversary there made us feel special with little cakes on those dates roof top pool and view was amazing location was perfect staff were super nice and they helped us from making reservation in a very hard to get into restaurant to finding our way around town breakfast was the best part of waking up we loved the hotel so much that we booked an extra day on our last day back from traveling to cadeques to barcelona for sure we go back and stay there
