the location of the hotel is very central and in a vibrant street few blocks away from la rambla the hotel staff were very helpful and courtuous the breakfast buffet was very rich and there was even a corner for gluten free products the room was exactly as i requested and very clean it had a coffee maker and a kettle with a daily complimentary water bottle i would definitely recommend this hotel for a solo traveller or a couple visiting the city for work or leisure
