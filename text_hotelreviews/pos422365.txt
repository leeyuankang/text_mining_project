this hotel was lovely we had a great time here and loved barcelona firstly the staff were very helpful there was a dedicated staff member to provide advice on what sights to see where to go to eat shop which was very helpful we only had two days in barcelona but we managed to fit in the main sights with help from the hotel staff the location was excellent i don t think we could have gotten better it was just a few hundred meters from the main street in barcelona la rambla and right near the beautiful catalunya square it was easy to get to everything and in walking distance to loads of restaurants and shops the actual hotel was in a very modern style with all the amenities you would want our room was very spacious with nice furnishings and functional spaces especially the bathroom it is a five star hotel so you would expect nothing less it also had a beautiful pool area on the rooftop level with magnificent views you could literally see everything including all the main sights and the ocean wow and you could even order food and drinks and laze on the deck chairs up there very good service i would highly recommend this hotel based on the location staff and service
