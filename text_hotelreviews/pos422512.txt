the location is excellent it s just steps off of plaza catalunya the hottest hub in the city but it s quiet the staff couldn t be nicer or more helpful the bottle of wine and chocolate truffles in my room upon arrival were lovely and there is a gourmet coffee machine and tea in the room with free bottled water replenished daily
