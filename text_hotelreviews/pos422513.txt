we booked the cheapest room via booking com upon arrival we like many others were upgraded to a room with a balcony facing the lower pool the room was well decorated the linens and layout stylish the bed very comfortable we enjoyed the upgraded room the less expensive rooms look out into a central courtyard elevator shaft which would have been a bit claustrophobic or to the main street a word of warning though we were on the floor and for those people who book the floor rooms with the private hot tubs all the rooms above can see down into your private hot tub since the triangular shade over the spa doesn t completely block the view from above we were surprised and happy to receive a complementary bottle of wine and chocolates on our first night the in room espresso maker was appreciated i didn t realize that the property had two pools prior to booking which was nice the vibe of the hotel is hip but still very comfortable and relaxed front desk services very friendly we did not eat there nor did we get breakfast but we were very pleased with the hotel the linens the amenities he location is superb very central to shopping the gothic quarter transportation airport bus subway la rambla restaurants if i return to barcelona i would definitely stay there again and would recommend to friends
