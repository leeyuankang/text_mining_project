in the lobby reception area they had jars of sweet treats that guests were able to help themselves to they left a stack of napkins and a pair of tongs for picking up sweets the complimentary water that were in glass bottles placed in the room really makes a difference walking distance from hotel to alot of major sights and attractions wifi is decent never dropped signal during my stay shower had excellent pressure and bathroom came with luxurious bathrobes
