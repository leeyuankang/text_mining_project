the room we stayed in had a private jacuzzi and was great it was not private as far as visibility from other guests and apartments were concerned but it was ours only to use with some privacy the bed was great and the bathroom was perfect as well the size of the room could have been slightly larger around the bed but it was not a deal breaker the lobby is very stylish clean and chic they offer you sparkling wine water or juice upon arrival overall the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful i would stay here again shopping restaurants bars grocery and many tourists attractions are all within blocks of the hotel a location this hotel is in the middle of it all
