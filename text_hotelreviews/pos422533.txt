a heaven of serenity in the busy and lively center of barcelona the friendliness of the staff and their helpful and competent advices to organize our barcelona experience were a real plus the hotels interior design is quite unique original and tasteful our room was large enough with a balcony on the quite inner court side and equipped with all amenities that make a hotel stay comfortable and enjoyable you can t get any closer to the city center and the main attractions but it s hassle free to get there by car and to park in the adjacent public underground garage at a preferential rate the rooftop plunge pool area is a perfect place to relax overlooking the buzzing plaza catalunya
