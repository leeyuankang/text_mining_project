this was a brilliant hotel great location friendly staff and little extras that made the stay prefect for my partners birthday they left a bottle of cava and piece of birthday cake in the room for when we got back i asked for a room higher up with a balcony and it didn t disappoint you could look right down into the square great for people watching the shower was amazing too lots of power and always warm beds very comfortable just outside the hotel you had a metro and in the square the hop on hop off bus and aerobus everything you need to get around the city we would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again in any other hotels we really enjoyed are time in barcelona so much to see and do what a fantastic city
