the hotel was in a very good location being close to the city centre the room was very nice and kept spotlessly clean there was a good choice of food for breakfast the best thing of all was the staff who were all very friendly and efficient english was widely spoken i was offered a glass of champagne at check in and was given a great welcome on arrival
