the hotel is in an excellent location we were able to shop sight see sun bathe and nip out for food and then pop back to the room to freshen up easily the staff were always friendly and happy to help when ever called upon the staff at the bar pool side were very good especially one man who was always darting about and waiting upon us like we were royalty amazing the room was very clean very comfortable and perfect for escaping the busy city
