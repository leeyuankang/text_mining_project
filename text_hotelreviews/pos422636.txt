the hotel was stunning and the staff very friendly we were upgraded to a room with balcony when we checked in which was quite big and overlooking rambla de catalunya the whole hotel is very stylish and beautifully decorated the breakfast menu is varied and even includes churros with hot chocolate sauce we would love to go back
