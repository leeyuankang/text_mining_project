loved this hotel stayed here for nights during the easter week it was the perfect place with the main bustle of las ramblas a five minute walk away past the plaza catalunya and you have the high end shopping of passeig de gracia just a block away being away from las ramblas is comforting since it s more quiet and no crowds around the hotel there s a convenience store around the corner and if you go across the plaza to el corte ingles a huge department store with a full supermarket at the basement the front staff was very welcoming and accommodating super attentive and quick to give suggestions on great places to eat the best thing was eden bar at the lobby of the hotel which had a very art deco feel totally perfect place to relax for a cup of coffee or a glass of cava bar staff was attentive as well the rooms were smallish but it was a decent size clean nicely decorated rooms and a very spacious king sized bed on our last morning we had breakfast at the basement restaurant the kitchen quite pricey person as expected but we found be it had great ambiance decent food and very welcoming staff
