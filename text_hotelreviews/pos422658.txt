the staff were helpful friendly the decor is beautiful the location is fab the free bottle of cava in the room on arrival was a lovely touch the room was cleaned to a high standard every day staff even came round the rooms in the evenings giving out little chocolates i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to barcelona and i will definitely be returning
