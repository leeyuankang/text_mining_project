everything in this hotel made our vacation perfect we even wanted to renew our stay but there was no empty rooms we had a great trouble finding a decent hotel after this one most hotels turn off the air conditioning and it s hot like hell other hotels tell you to open the window in the very busy barcelona metropolitan is a true hotel with perfect room design super friendly staff clean rooms comfortable beds not noisy rooms and great position they even offered us a complementary champagne bottle but since we don t drink they took it away and got us orange juice instead we also got a free upgrade to a room with a terrace balcony
