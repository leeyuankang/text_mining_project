i arrived a few hours early but my room was gotten ready within an hour the shower in my room was the best shower i have had in europe the complimentary champagne as a welcoming gift was an extremely friendly gesture which put a smile on my face and in my heart the reception was helpful in excess of what they needed to be thank you
