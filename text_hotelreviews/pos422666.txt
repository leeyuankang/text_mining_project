the location was absolutely fantastic as its just next to placa catalunya and close to where the aerobus stops even though the rooms are small they are very well equipped the bed and toilet is very comfortable the service of the staff is excellent one of staff members i forget his name but he is originally from russia booked tickets for us and forgot to give us the right printout he jogged for nearly minutes to find us and give the tickets they offer two free computers in the reception along with a printer i ve never seen a hotel offer this service for free also the wifi is very fast
