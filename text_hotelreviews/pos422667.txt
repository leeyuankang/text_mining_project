fantastic location for exploring barcelona the room was quiet and comfortable well appointed with useful things for female travellers such as a full length mirror good mirrors and lighting for doing hair and make up plenty of plug sockets for charging devices etc so many hotels forget the little things that make travelling so much nicer the staff were very nice and helpful the public areas were really nice to relax in i would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again
