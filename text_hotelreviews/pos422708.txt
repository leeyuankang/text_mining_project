the location of this hotel and the room facilities were excellent and well worth paying just a little bit more for as a young muslim couple food is always a consideration for us but the breakfast options were very wide and we definitely didn t go hungry the service from reception staff was also of a very high standard every request was met with a smile and we found them to be incredibly helpful particularly maria
