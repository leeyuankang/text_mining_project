everything was perfect the design of the hotel was superb and the communal areas were gorgeous especially the roof terrace the rooms were spotless and extremely comfortable the staff couldn t be more helpful especially as we changed rooms and they did everything they could to make our stay memorable we had a bottle of chilled champagne and a welcome letter waiting for us when we got back on the first night
