has to be one of the best breakfast offerings we have come across the staff were very friendly and helpful right in the middle of barcelona so very convenient there was a car park adjacent to the hotel that did cost euro that was a good thing considering the central position a great bathroom with double basins making washing clothes easy as well as a large shower that was not over a bath the bed was comfortable
