as far as service style and amenities it s one of the best hotels i ve stayed in great location for exploring the city however it s an enjoyable stroll minutes if the beach is more what you re after the staff went out of their way to make customers feel like welcome guests and the hotel includes some unannounced complimentary amenities you usually only see in hotels with private club floors not as luxurious as a top end hotel but much more on offer than an average happily exceeded my expectations
