very clean hotel they clearly have their housekeeping staff well trained the hotel has a good roof terrace with excellent views of the city and a bar that opens in the evenings the swimming pool is very small so don t expect to be swimming lengths the location is perfect on the ramblas and close to passieg de gracia train station shops and restaurants the torres restaurant is just around the corner and we would recommend this for an excellent meal overall an excellent choice for a city break in barcelona
