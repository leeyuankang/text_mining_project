the room was reasonably big and i had a balcony it was clean as well the hotel had a pleasant roof top terrace with a nice view and very quiet there was a tiny swimming pool as well so i imagine in summer it is refreshing my room was quiet so i slept well i appreciated the easy access to the wifi system the fantastic central location and the easy access the friendly staff at the reception
