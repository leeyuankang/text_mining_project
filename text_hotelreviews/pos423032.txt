our room was a good size with a private balcony with a great view the king sized bed was very comfortable loved the roof garden we had friends staying at the hotel and we met them in the roof garden for a drink before dinner bathroom was a decent size and very clean was about a minute walk to la rambla but that wasn t so bad as we were far enough back from the crazy crowds we were very happy with our stay staff were very courteous and helpful location was great
