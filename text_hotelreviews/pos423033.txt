entering the room my wife s first impression was the room is perfect the breakfast was amazing and there was a wide variety the staffs were friendly to help and provide details the checkout really helped me and the cab was available at the entrance at the location was perfect to walk to any of the gaudi s casa buildings i walked from la rambala almost everyday during my stay well connected to the shopping area the room was looking the streets and i was looking at the streets but quite honestly why do you need a view and what are you doing inside the hotel instead of being out there enjoying your tapas and sangria i will definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice safe stay the pricing was a bit high but my over all impression would be to return here if i am visiting barcelona again
