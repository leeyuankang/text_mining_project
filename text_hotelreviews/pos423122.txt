the hotel itself is in a great location if you re looking to be close to la ramlas but also close to the gothic quarter we walked from the port one day which only took us half an hour the rooms were fantastic with an even better view the mesh around the windows make it that little bit better however the rooftop pool bar was insane we love our sunrises and sunsets and from there you can see it all whilst sipping a gin and tonic with a dj playing
