great accessible location we took the airport to central la catalunya bus as we landed in terminal the bus journey is a non stop service and takes roughly minutes we paid for a single ticket as we were unsure of how we would travel back to the airport at the time the hotel is a minute walk from central la catalunya la ramblas is a minute walk away so really ideal you re away from all the noise yet close enough to walk there the hotel amazing hotel with unique decor really comfortable rooms providing the necessities such as towels shower gel shampoo conditioner a shower cap and a shaving kit great for those staying for a short time with only hand luggage great views from our hotel room as well as from the hotel rooftop bar easy to access using the hotel lift and just phenomenal views they have a bar which is reasonably priced definitely worth it to view a sunset the pool is quite small which is why i scored it in the middle we didn t check the pool size and not sure if the dimensions are on their website but we were prepared with our swimming gear in case however they didn t come to use the hotel breakfast this was complimentary in our price and the breakfast was delicious great coffee machine with teas available too good selection of fruits breads juices cakes as well as sausages scrambled eggs mushrooms tomatoes and bacon they even have a toastie so you can make your own grilled sandwiches with sliced meats and cheese provided p s we were handled by irene at reception who was really helpful she gave us the advice we required as well as handy tips and recommendations thank you irene
