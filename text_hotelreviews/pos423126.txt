a modern designed hotel clean and friendly however with some flaws each small but all adding because of the limited size of the rooms the architect opted not for one enclosed bathroom but three separate parts which are also combined with the closet the closet door doubles as the toilet door too not the most convenient also the hotel has only elevators for its total rooms and floors causing quite a wait for an elevator to come the room windows are locked preventing open air small desk not allowing comfortable use
