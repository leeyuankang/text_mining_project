we were given a free upgrade to a junior suite which was great the bed was fantastic and great views across the city fantastic location and staff very helpful restaurant manager was great we arrived a little late and the restaurant was not taking any further bookings but he squeezed us in which was very welcome given that it was late and torrential rain outside the rooftop terrace bar is lovely we were given a restaurant recommendation by reception which was fab
