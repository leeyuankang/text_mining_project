huge bed and lovely room we were lucky enough to be on the top floor with spectacular views shame about the metal mesh in front of window though bathroom and bedroom all in one room fantastic for couples as very intimate sliding door on the toilet room so no panic fantastic location walk form las rambla great bar seconds walk from hotel rooftop terrace prices very high would definitely go back
