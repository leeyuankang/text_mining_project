excellent hotel the staff were friendly and welcoming the location was good and only a short walk to la rambla where you can access the metro and the many cafes restaurants and shops not to mention art galleries and museums the view of barcelona from the floor of the hotel is amazing the food served at the hotel was of high quality i would definitely stay at this hotel again if i should return to barcelona
