we have stayed at the hotel many times the beds are huge and very comfortable the design of the rooms are cool and the rooftop terrace and pool are very nice after a day in the city towel service good cocktails and snacks but a bit pricey we always get an upgrade for free when there are available rooms the location is good close to the centre
