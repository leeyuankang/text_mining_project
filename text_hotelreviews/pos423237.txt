very goog hotel with perfect location raval is even better than famous rambla at least if you just want to sit and relax without too much tourists pool area is very nice even though the pool itself is not really a pool more like big jacuzzi make sure you book the room that is in top floors you only get the full benefits of your stay when you can marvel the great view from your room
