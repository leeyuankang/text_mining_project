the location was excellent close to la rambla and all the side streets off with all the great restaurants etc all the major sites were within walking distance or a short tube ride away the hotel itself was ultra modern and quite luxurious the bed was massive and extremely comfortable we were upgraded upon arrival to the eighth floor which meant we had fantastic views all in all good value for money
