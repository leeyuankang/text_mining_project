what i loved about the hotel is that before we arrived we mentioned that it s our wedding anniversary so we wanted to make sure we get a queen bed because it was our wedding anniversary we got upgraded and also got one bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries it was such a pretty gesture of the hotel management they made our anniversary start very very positive clean rooms amazing view good location i would definitely recommend the hotel
