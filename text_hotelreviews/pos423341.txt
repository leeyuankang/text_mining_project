the decor of the hotel is outstanding very modern trendy perfect for a young couple having a romantic trip the terrace is cool with beautiful views the food is very good general ambience of the restaurant is chilled and again very modern the rooms are gorgeous not huge but really nice additional touches see through shower electronic sliding blinds full length windows fluorescent lighting that you change colour over the bed coffee machine ipod dock flatscreen tv and a massive sized bed don t worry about other reviews about the area yes honestly it s not the nicest part of barcelona but you are minutes walk from ramblas if that like all cities all over the world stay on the main streets you won t encounter any undesirables overall we loved it would absolutely stay here again and massively recommend for young couples
