the staff were so helpful they were able to accommodate all of our requests to make our visit extra special we asked for champagne to be in our room prior to arrival as it was our honeymoon and they totally delivered more then we could ve imagined the junior suite is the way to go so much space shower hot tub were amazing the bed was super soft and comfortable the nespresso machine in the room was nice to have available anytime you wanted the location is in walking distance to some great restaurants and las ramblas the area surrounding the hotel is a bit eclectic not so touristy you are definitely in the city not near the beach make sure you visit the rooftop bar which provides amazing views of the city
