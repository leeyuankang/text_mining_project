this is a nice hotel with good facilities on an outer layer in barcelona very close to the beach and in a nice and safe area but to access most of barcelona s attractions you need to take a min bus ride just outside the building this is more of a business hotel rather than one for holidays about min walk to a nice new mall with a large carrefour market
