so for us the location was perfect a little quiet plenty of dining options and close enough to down town we enjoyed the rambla del poblenou the rambla is one block away and offers lots of interesting walking restaurants and cafes we enjoyed being minutes away by bicycle from the downtown which can be really hectic at high season
