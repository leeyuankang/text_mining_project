i stayed here for nights on a business trip and the hotel is overall average the wifi is good and the rooms are decent but it is definitely not a leisure hotel i stayed here while the mobile congress was going on so the price per night was too much definitely not value for money i didnt eat the hotel much but tried room service once which was good
