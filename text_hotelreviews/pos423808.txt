comfortable beds bright rooms and even got tea and coffee making facilities which we shouldn t have got with our room fantastic service from all staff and glad they did that little bit extra and gave us the kettle in the room the hotel is a little further out but minutes away from the metro and same from the beach along with some great bars tapas just around the corner would definitely stay again
