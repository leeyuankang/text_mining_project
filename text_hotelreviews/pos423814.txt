much more spacious than i thought it would be a little bit corporate which is exactly what we wanted the staff were smiley and friendly we wanted to come and go relatively anonymously as felt a bit conscious of being in someone s home when we did air bnb i really liked the area as it was a little bit residential but with some bars restaurants and cafes used by locals not just tourists near the beach so saw lots of people in sports wear cycling running etc i love to visit laces and get a sense of everyday life going on we walked along beach into town may have taken half an hour but nice stroll perfect for us
