room was excellent it was very specious and was not expecting that at all the bed was big and very comfy and i liked the fact that it had a nice bathtub overall had a wonderful stay i was a bit worried as i thought we would be far from the city center and didn t want to go there to avoid the expensive prices but its was less than total both walking to the tram and getting there and what makes it even better the price and the quality of the hotel was waaaay better from hotels located directly in the center
