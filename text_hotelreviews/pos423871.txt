we opted to upgrade for the jacuzzi tub room that was worth it the room and the bathroom were both large the views from the high floors were great the ac worked well wifi was free the king bed was huge given that we were running around being tourists most of the time this was a nice room to come back to and relax some nearby restaurants and stores and a metro station and close to the beach
