the location of this hotel was excellent just off the rambla with plenty of cafes bars and bakeries which was both convenient and fun he hotel is a minute walk to he beach which was a big plus the metro station was also near by but perhaps one of the best features was he friendly and helpful staff when we realized we left an important item in our room they mailed it on to our next hotel i would highly recommend this clean and comfortable hotel
