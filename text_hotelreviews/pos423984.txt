we have stayed here twice and just love the place such a great location mins walk to the beach but still miles away from the tourist crowds pay the extra for the deluxe rooms they are such great value really large and spacious with small balcony looking out over the city one way and the sea the other way the rooms are modern with a lovely bathroom with big bath several english tv channels the hotel is located off a small rumbla with many cafes and restaurants and bars but all very local in atmosphere highly recommended
