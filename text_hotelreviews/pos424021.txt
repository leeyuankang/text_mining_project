the hotel was massive and the common areas were very clean super fast wifi to get a social media fix day or night the rooms were also huge and beds very comfortable plenty of cupboard space and easy to settle in for a couple of days the location was so good right behind a local avenue home to so many local shops and restaurants so we found ourselves not needing to go into barcelona city for entertainment nearly all of the staff were helpful and lovely
