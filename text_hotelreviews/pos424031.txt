the hotel was beautifully maintained and decorated the staff were helpful and friendly and our check in was very efficient we didn t have the breakfast so i cannot judge the food but the amazing location of the hotel means you are a stone throw away from a strip of wonderful bars and restaurants with amazing food glorious beaches lie just a minute walk away
