the location was terrific only two blocks to the tram line that leads down to the big schottentor tram and underground station on the ring or a three four block walk to the station which is also the beginning of the bus into stefansdom it is only a couple of blocks the other way for the airport bus the hotel breakfast was pretty pricy but the stadtkind cafe is nearby and provides a good selection
