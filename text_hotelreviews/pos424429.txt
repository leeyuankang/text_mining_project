good hotel in the vienna center very good location if you want to explore the city center walking our standard room was incredibly small but the staff was friendly enough to offer us a good price for an upgrade to executive room which was spacious and comfortable the breakfast was excellent parking is quite far but acceptable comparing to the hotel s location
