i stayed here with my husband and one year old for days as we had a big suite it was more than enough space and convenient for us plus we loved how quiet it was it would have been ideal for my husband and i to have one bed to ourselves instead of small beds side by side it was very clean and lovely decor the proximity of the hotel to major tourist attractions was great and loved that all metro stations have lifts which makes it easy when you have a pushchair we only had breakfast every day at the hotel and maybe a bigger variety of things everyday at the buffet would have been nice different cheeses and more fruit selection no bananas and decaffeinated tea or coffee for those that require it the staff in the hotel were all very friendly and helpful and accommodated us easily overall we are quite pleased with this hotel and would return in the future
