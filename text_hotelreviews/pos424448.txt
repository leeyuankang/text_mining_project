very friendly check in and really nice decor throughout we had a lovely attic room which was nice and quiet and cosy they warned us it was a small room but we thought it was fine right beside the rathaus which was great for the christmas markets as vienna city centre is relatively small the hotel is within walking distance of the main attractions good buffet breakfast in the morning
