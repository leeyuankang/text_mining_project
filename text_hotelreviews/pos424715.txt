beautiful very comfortable hotel staff were very friendly and approachable the breakfast had a great selection and we loved the village the hotel was located in with its own vineyard the village has a good variety of restaurants very close by not in the centre of vienna and it takes a bus tram to get into the city but a good reliable transport service allowed us to do this easily we would thoroughly recommend this hotel
