i like the fact that staff has been very efficient in giving directions how to get to hotel from the airport how to get to different locations from the hotel where to eat etc it is very easy to get around because of the staff s spot on instructions for direction the staff is also always willing to help you feel the genuine concern that they have and they always want to make you feel as comfortable as possible the room was always clean when i get back from a day of touring different parts of vienna the breakfast every morning was filling you could have fresh eggs cooked however you want it and hot chocolate there is an array of cold cuts cheeses breads spreads cereals and fruits i even had some food packed for snack for the rest of my day the location although a bit on the outskirt isn t a problem at all the transport system was efficient and it s nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet and relaxing atmosphere where the hotel is lastly when i checked out the nice lady gave me a free ticket to get to the airport because my hour vienna card has already expired i appreciate the gesture again the entire staff make you feel as comfortable as possible
