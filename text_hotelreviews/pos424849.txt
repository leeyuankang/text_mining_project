we loved this place the staff super friendly and our room was amazing we had a master suite upstairs and at the landing access to a private outdoor space w shower our kids slept on the pull out sofa in the lower living room area which they found very comfortable major plus was the roof top pool to come back to after a day out exploring the city while small it was perfect to cool off and relax for a bit another great touch was the free buffet in the bar area off the lobby every day at to help get us all acclimated to eating dinner at location was perfect even the restaurant elsa y fred across the street was phenomenal really so many great little touches made this hotel awesome we had a fabulous stay
