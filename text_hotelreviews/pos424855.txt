catalonia born is a cool modern and very comfortable hotel in the funky el born area walking distance to la ramblas and other attractions brilliant beds and bathrooms the rooftop pool might be tiny but it offered an escape from the crowds the small but fresh and healthy courtesy buffet daily was greatly appreciated sandwiches a soup something hot salads cake and decent coffee helped recharge the batteries so we could go out and meander through the nearby lanes
