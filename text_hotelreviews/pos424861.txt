this is a perfect central spot close to arc de triomphe palau de musica and gothic quarter many tours start nearby or you can leap on the metro at arc de triumphed or urquinoana after a hot day the free tapas and swimming were a godsend some staff were fantastic thanks lissette and reception were friendly and helpful if you have a hankering to get about by car the hotel have a special rate on great public parking very nearby we loved this boutique hotel
