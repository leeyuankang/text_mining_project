this hotel is a little gem the staff are really efficient and the room lovely although we were opposite a bar we never heard a thing at all the beds really comfy the little touch of a buffet which is free for guests is so generous the breakfast was always good too not too much choice but plenty of everything that you would expect the pool was really small a dipping pool really but very sweet and clean and a real sun trap if you have time that is also it was my husbands birthday while we were there i never said a thing but his birthday cards must have given it away and when we returned from our day out there was a bottle of bubbly how thoughtful and kind of the hotel to do this rooms were clean and fresh towels every day excellent would book again
