the staff were amazing and so kind and thoughtful they made our stay in the hotel a wonderful experience sending up a bottle of champagne on arrival for my boyfriends birthday barcelona itself as beautiful as it is was not so kind to us we were robbed on our first night then the following day we were supposed to see barcelona v villareal we bought match tickets online before we left for our holiday but when we got to the stadium we were told they were invalid and someone else had already arrived in the stadium with the same tickets there were quite a few ppl around us that this had happened to so be careful if purchasing online we left barcelona feeling pretty downhearted but we kept telling each other at least the hotel was great
