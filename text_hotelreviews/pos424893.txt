the staff were friendly and very helpful the rooms were of adequate size with large comfortable beds the breakfast choice was varied and was of good quality a free buffet was available every day in the bar area between and there was a variety of small sandwiches cakes croissants even soup and a hot dish tea coffee and soft drinks were included the hotel is situated on a fairly quiet side street just around the corner from the arc de triomp las ramblas is about minutes walking distance also within walking distance was the ciutadella park where there is a zoo quite expensive not visited the ports and beaches and the sagrada familia church if you visit the sagrada familia suggest you book online it is cheaper than paying at the church and you can select a time slot for your visit which avoids problems it is a very popular attraction there are two computers in the lobby area of the hotel which are free to use at any time i have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
