this is an excellent hotel the staff were lovely we arrived in pouring rain and they made sure we were checked in as quickly as possible so we could go and get dry they also gave us vouchers for a complimentary drink each the free tapas were great it saved us going out again on that rainy night and saved us some money over the weekend the breakfast at extra cost was great value for money a wide selection and very tasty we would definitely stay here again
