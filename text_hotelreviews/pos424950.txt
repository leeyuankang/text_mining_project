the location is perfect in a hip neighborhood with great restaurants a block away from the arc de triomf an awesome park and public transit it s an ideal starting point for sightseeing across the street from a very good tapas restaurant and just a block from a cafe with great coffee and pastries the room and hotel is updated and very clean the rooftop pool and lounge though small and shallow is a great amenity
