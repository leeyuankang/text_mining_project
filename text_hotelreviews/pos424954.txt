i can t comment on the breakfast as i didn t eat at the hotel but the room was very comfortable and modern with good coffee and tea making facilities excellent wi fi and air conditioning and a handy small safe the bathroom was spacious and had both bath and shower cubicle i stayed for three nights and was given a voucher on arrival for a complementary glass of cava in the bar the location is excellent and quite central handy for most sightseeing and tourist areas very close to the arc de triomphe and minutes walk to the gothic cathedral but in a very quiet little street
