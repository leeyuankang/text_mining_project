excellent location just a few minutes walk to the subway station bus route to the beach stops even closer many good restaurants nearby we had a room with own terrace on the top floor and there was only a short corridor to the swimming pool on the roof no street view from the terrace but nevertheless nice view over the roof tops no street noise at all staff was very friendly and helpful breakfast was good room was cleaned daily and wifi worked well all in all we highly recommend this hotel and especially the room with own terrace
