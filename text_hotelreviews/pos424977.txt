great location helpful but unobtrusive staff el born is a fabulous area of barcelona to explore plenty of cafes and bars close by including a small convenience store friends stayed a few blocks away paid a lot more for their room but i think this hotel was better breakfast catered for my husband and myself who are gluten free so that was a real bonus highly recommended
