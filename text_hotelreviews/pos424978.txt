the hotel is in the el born district and close to good restaurants etc but it is still a seedy area and you have to be on your guard for pickpockets etc we did not feel safe unless walking with our group of friends the staff were helpful and the room facilities comfortable close enough to some of the attractions especially the hop on hop off bus
