the hotel is just about perfect in my opinion walking distance to las ramblas train stations and all the attractions but off the beaten path enough for you to enjoy a good night s sleep when you are in town the rooms are very comfortable and the wi fi is speedy as well as reliable there is a large comfortable bed and the staff is extremely accommodating the breakfast is also very good it was on special for euros when i was there and worth it but all around there are great places to go also don t miss the restaurant across the street it s outstanding overall i couldn t be happier with this hotel and can t imagine staying anywhere else in barcelona
