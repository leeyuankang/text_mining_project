we found this hotel to be exactly what we were after to finish off our short and busy trip to europe it was very comfortable and we enjoyed relaxing by the small but pleasant roof top pool we found the hotel to be well appointed and in a great location in the gothic part of town with its lovely maze of shops and restaurants and wonderful food hall a few streets away we had two metro stations nearby which made it very easy to get around it is very close to the arc d triompf and it s series of lovely gardens the buffet breakfast had a good variety and was excellent value at the discounted rate of euros during our stay the staff were very approachable and helpful we would definitely come back to catalonia born again
