the hotel is located within mins walk to covent garden and a shoet taxi ride to the theatre district if you want to save your high heels the british museum is very close and there is close proximity to shopping and restaurants the hotel has historic links to the titanic through its architecthe which was of interest to my party the staff were very helpful
