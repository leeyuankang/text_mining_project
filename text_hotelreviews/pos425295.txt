especially if you book the room with the view the room is spacious and will have a great view of the square my friends stayed in the no view room as per their comments they were not much satisfied with the room very nice breakfast staff was very helpful like in most of the hotels in amsterdam amazing location you can find any type of restaurant and or shop within minutes walking distance i would definitely consider booking this hotel again
