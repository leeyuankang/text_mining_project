fantastic location right on rembrandtplein room overlooked the square trams right outside the door probably one of the best locations in amsterdam in terms of things to see do food nightlife and branching out easily around the city hotel was excellent this is our visit to this hotel the service is great the room immaculate and the location is second to none we ll keep coming back
