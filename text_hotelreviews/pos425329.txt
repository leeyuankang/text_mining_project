be careful because of the cafes restaurants and tramways downstairs it might be quite noisy fortunately i had room with window on the back and view on the roofs of amsterdam perfectly quiet i worried at the reception when i asked if the rooms had air conditioning and they answered no the fact is they do you just don t get to control it my room was at a perfectly comfortable temperature despite the damp dutch summer oh and the cold air vent is silent and you can close it lots of power sockets everywhere free tea coffee and water boiler in the room nice minibar windows open entirely breakfast on the first floor balcony with view on rembrandtplein grocery store drug store and cinema are only a couple hundred meters away literally in the same street
