the hotel was located in the best square in amsterdam on the rembdrandtplein it is full of cool bars coffeeshops restaurants and casinos cinemas etc anything you d need in a short trip to the city it was very clean throughout the staff were incredibly friendly and the room was quiet day or night as it was located at the back of the hotel it was the location that sold me on this hotel as i wanted to be able to pop back up to the room whenever i wanted without having to battle through the extremely busy amsterdam streets for too long so overall it was a nearly perfect hotel
