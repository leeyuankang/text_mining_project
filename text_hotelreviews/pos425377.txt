a good hotel with generously sized rooms friendly staff and a superb location the room was spacious on the top floor of the hotel so we got a view of the city albeit over the ugly rooftops of the adjoining building on lower levels unless you get a room at the front of the hotel you may not get any view so be sure to ask
