the hotel was in an amazing location initially was put in a standard room with a twin bed when i had actually booked a superior room with a double bed when i went to enquire at reception about this the staff went to great lengths that i received the room i paid for there was friendly and welcoming service throughout the entire trip and the hotel itself had beautiful old fashioned features mixed with modern and clean interior in the rooms furthermore i read reviews regarding it being too noisy at this location however i had no personal experience of this couldn t hear anything from the room we stayed in on the back of the hotel and they also provide ear plugs in the rooms couldn t have asked for much more
