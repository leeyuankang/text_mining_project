my husband and i thought the breakfast was excellent but after having seen mice yes mice running around quite openly in the area where the buffet breakfast is laid out in the morning for hours over the tables that we ate and drank at over and around dishes and glasses that we ate and drank from this area is also were food is served during the day and the bar area i m afraid we were shocked and alarmed at the lack of food hygiene standards if this is what we could see openly what was behind the scenes we felt it was safer not to eat or drink in the hotel mice in one area of the hotel also tells you that they are probably elsewhere as well and if there are mice running around in the open what other vermin problems could they also have so i m afraid i was very unhappy in our bedroom and afraid to turn off the lights and go to sleep i understand that mice and rats can be a problem in amsterdam but i m afraid hotels especially a so called star one needs to ensure health and hygiene standards within their property for their guests and they have a responsibility and a legal obligation to do so nh are a large worldwide group so pest control should not be a problem to them if the attitude of their staff is anything to go by they just do not care
