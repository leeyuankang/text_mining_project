staff were very helpful when we asked to change rooms which we did because of the noise from the after party going on downstairs hotel site neglected to mention that there is a live talk show hosted every week night from about which means metal detectors and security guards in the lobby and consequent noise fun if you want that sort of thing but unexpected however our new room on the fifth floor was delightful quiet view over the rooms of amsterdam and comfortable beds great central location for walking about the city and catching trams plus street entertainment and watchmen sculpture also clouds of marijuana smoke from people chilling out in the rembrandtsplein which might put some people off
