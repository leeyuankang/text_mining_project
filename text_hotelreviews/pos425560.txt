all the food was well prepared presented well and all the meals we had tasted lovely staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much bother for them as we requested several things and they were so willing we requested a room change and this was done as soon as was possible for them at no extra cost barbara was the member of staff we saw the most and she was absolutely wonderful in making us feel comfortable
