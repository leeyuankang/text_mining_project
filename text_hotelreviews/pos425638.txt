very busy location overlooking rembrandt s statue and the characters from the night watch which was a bonus as i felt safe returning on my own after dark very noisy when windows were open but ear plugs were provided fantastic breakfast good range of gluten free stuff as well and very friendly and helpful staff could leave luggage on my last day it was kept securely with a receipt good wifi lovely old hotel with history and character
