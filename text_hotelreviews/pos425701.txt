for the type of hotel it is it s perfect if you arrive and are disappointed the only thing i could imagine is that you were expecting a luxury hotel to rival the waldorf the location is great the staff is kind the breakfast was decent and it s an excellent price for what and where it is this is probably one of the best hotels for younger people who are trying to experience the crazy amsterdam scene and for those of us who would like to be in the middle of the city without spending a fortune but i would not recommend it for business travelers
