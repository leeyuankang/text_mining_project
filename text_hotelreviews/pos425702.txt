staff were very pleasant welcoming and helpful the location was perfect minute walk from dam square but along the way there was lots of shops cafes restaurants coffee shops and bars but if you didn t want to walk there is a tram stop right across the street to take you in the local people were also very friendly fantastic hotel would definitely stay there again
