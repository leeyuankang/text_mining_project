when we first arrived we wanted to get out there and look around straight away the check in was spot on we had our room key and everything sorted in minutes the location is absolutely perfect extremely central to all the best bars cafes restraunts wide variety also a few clubs around we travelled as young couples so we wanted to make sure we had the best hotel for the money we paid the hotel itself was very clean very high standards all the staff are extremely helpful and willing to do anything for you beautiful touch they advised us of the best restraunts and bars to have a great night out took the advise and the night was great it was only a short weekend away for the forst time in amsterdam but we managed to get so much done all the sights to see etc the trams are centrally located which is just outside the hotel never too hard to get a plan together and then go and do it overall i would rate this hotel only thing what wasn t perfect was the price but definitely is worth every penny would recommend to anyone of all ages and groups nh schiller would definitely accept you
