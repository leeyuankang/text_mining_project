location was perfect eliza staff was very friendly helpful in planning our hours in amsterdam rooms are very small definitely not sound proof but we were more interested in sight seeing not hanging out in a room all day we found the staff to be more than accommodating filled our every request with a sincere smile if you re looking for easy access to the tram it s the perfect place to be hotel is in rembrandt park approximately of a mile from centraal station with a short tram ride to all areas of interest final thoughts amazing value for its location would definitely recommend return to this hotel thank you again for a lovely stay
