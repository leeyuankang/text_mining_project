this was my third stay at an nh hotel but my first at this property nevertheless the staff found my nh hotels loyalty programme membership number and treated me as if i were a frequent guest at that hotel there was a personalised hand written welcome note from the manager upon my arrival in the room all of my special requests provided for before my arrival including the type and number of pillows that i like the amenities were five star there was free bubbly and flat water waiting for me upon my arrival as well as a tube of chocolate candies m ms type a nice touch the hotel was very well located next to the belvedere palace and the room was large clean and very comfortable
