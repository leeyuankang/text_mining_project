the staff were very friendly and helpful others who have stayed here noted their dismay at it not being located near an u bahn station however the hotel is about one city block distance from the unteres belvedere tram line stop on the line that goes to the opera ring area and karlsplatz u bahn station and lines also the staff can arrange a taxi to the airport when you leave so all in all this hotel affords you a little peace quiet from the humming tourist center part of vienna while allowing easy access to the main shopping tourist spots other reviewers noted problems with the wifi but signal strength was more than adequate even allowing for good connection for using facetime stayed on the floor the breakfast was an impressive spread of hot and cold items with plenty of seating in the breakfast room room itself was clean and on par if a little more spacious than rooms in b b s that i ve previously stayed at just off karntner strasse would definitely stay here again
