we stayed at the nh belvedere hotel in may and it was a great stay the hotel was easily accessible from the vienna hbf through a subway or even tram just get off at rennweg station and you are at belvedere staff was very polite and very accommodating the room and bathrooms were spacious you can even get a electric kettle in your room free the hotel is nearby the main vienna highlights though would recommend to get vienna travel pass as there is a tram that runs right near the hotel no which takes you to the ring which is the place where all the monuments etc are we took a free walking tour which started from behind the opera house and it takes you all around the old city about hours great tour to understand the history and get to know the place the belvedere palace is just behind the hotel so you cannot miss it however you take a train from rennweg to go and visit the schonbrunn palace overall the stay at the hotel was great good location and there is plenty of halal food joints so don t worry
