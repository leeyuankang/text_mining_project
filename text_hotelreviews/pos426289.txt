the location of the hotel was great within walking distance of public transport if you didn t want to walk but very close to local attractions we got a taxi to the hotel from the airport but could have easily got a train we didn t realise at the time but got a train back to the airport staff were great their english was fantastic and they were helpful when asked about public transport
