our hotel was right next to the belvedere palace it was a nice and safe neighbourhood then again vienna itself is an extremely safe and organized city there was a tram that stopped right next to the hotel and that takes you to the city center the hotel is old but that s part of the charm the room was extremely spacious with high ceilings we also got a tub will definitely stay here again
