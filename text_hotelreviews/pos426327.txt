we stayed for nights our room was very clean staff were very friendly and helpful we enjoyed the buffet breakfast we were about a minute walk to a majority of the sites which suited us but the belvedere palace was almost next door and the grounds there are beautiful to stroll around there is so much to see but we ran out of time
