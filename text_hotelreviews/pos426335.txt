excellent hotel helpful staff excellent breakfast well positioned arrived by taxi late at night arranged by the hotel whilst worth it particularly in view of the fact we had a foiled pick pocket attempt at the underground on our return to the airport be aware transport on tram very easy and takes you straight to the city centre
