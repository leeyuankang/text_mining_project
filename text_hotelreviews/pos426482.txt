i very rarely rate above but this hotel really deserves is facilities and rooms are wide and spacious large bathroom with separate toilet area very comfortable stay despite the high number of rooms and guests one does not have the feeling of being in a crowded hotel very quiet i am not sure whether the rooms are soundproof or not but did bot hear a thing wifi is good even for online film streaming room had a safety deposit box large enough for a laptop and several documents it also had a plug that would allow to charge your devices while stored location is aprox walk from city centre a train station is walk allowing easy transport to the airport and the rest of the city
