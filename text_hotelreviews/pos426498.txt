my second stay here and did not disappoint the room is large and was good for friends travelling together location is great an easy walk into central vienna and right near the belvedere palace there is a s bahn and tram stop nearby very easy to get to and from the airport with rennweg station across the road couple of euros and about direct to the airport best way to travel to the airport
