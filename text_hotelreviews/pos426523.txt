we were very happy with the location and the ease of getting into the city center via the tram which you picked up just outside the hotel we were very pleased with the size of our room the bathroom and the amount of closet space allowing us to easily unpack we found the room very well appointed with everything we needed the staff was friendly and helpful we wouldn t hesitate to stay here again
