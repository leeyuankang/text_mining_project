stayed at the hotel for the second time and i was satisfied large and clean rooms helpful and polite team breakfast was a little pricey but delicious makes for a good start of the day near the hotel there is few places for a good breakfast from airport by train blue line to exeting rennweg stop and over the road you ll see the hotel only minutes who do not like walking then downtown will be by tram no
