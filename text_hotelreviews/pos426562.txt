we had a large room on the floor with a full balcony which would have been lovely to use if it weren t december great executive lounge and a choice of two breakfasts we walked everywhere though a trolley stop is across the street right next to the botanical gardens just a short walk to belvedere castle and gardens and a bit longer to the central ring and other major attractions nice bar with piano the prix fixe menu at christmas even included wine
