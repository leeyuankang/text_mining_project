absolutely perfect stay it is not in the city center of vienna but vienna is not a big city at all also you can take the underground or tram to any part of city the station is less than walk so this hotel is extremely convenient and very good value for money the breakfast is definitely perfect just try it and you won t regret the room is very clean and very large
