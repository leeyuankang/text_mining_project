this is a truly great hotel it has everything you might want or need from a or stars hotel at a resonable price i m not saying low price because vienna is not cheap when it comes to finding a central good hotel besides the general trend of greed in the hotel business but the people at this hotel succeds everytime it was our or staying here in giving us the feeling that they really give back or at least offer their best service for the charge thank you guys see you soon
