the room was very roomy and comfortable the wifi was very good indeed the conference facilities that we used were also very good the overhad projector failed but the support staff had a backup projector installed and working within five minutes the front desk staff were very helpful in particular they explained to us how to get to the belvedere palace via the botanical gardens that made it easy and of course both are well worth the visit do visit the upper belevedere and look at the view from the top floor as shown in the attached photo
