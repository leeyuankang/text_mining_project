we booked a suite which was very spacious bed and pillows were very comfortable i follow a gluten free diet and the hotel was very polite in offering me gluten free rolls and bread every morning not many hotels do that so i appreciated that greatly the breakfast was very rich although i was suprised there were no oats at the cereal selection but besides that it was fantastic the location is very good the belvedere palace is beautiful and we took the kids to run around the gardens nearly everyday some people wrote that it is not really a family hotel but i disagree it was very child friendly and the staff were very sweet with our two children would definitely stay there again
