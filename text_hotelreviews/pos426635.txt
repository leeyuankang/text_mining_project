location is superb and close to the underground station the rooms are large with welcome air conditioning and the bathroom is large and well designed with plenty of toiletries the mini bar is well stocked but everything is chargeable including bottled water the staff are very helpful this is not a noisy hotel overall very good value for money except the breakfasts
