we were in an executive room which was very comfortable although breakfast was served in the exec lounge you also had the option of eating in the breakfast room on floor on our first night we ate in the exec lounge dining room and can recommend the steak it was beautifully cooked the mini bar is complimentary and various toiletries are available in the bathroom so you do not need to bring your own the tram takes you in to the centre in minutes but if you like to walk it takes about minutes to the opera house remember to go left when you leave the hotel
