the rooms at the hotel were large and very clean the staff were marvellous and nothing was too much trouble for them we really appreciated the lovely breakfasts we were a group of friends travelling together and found the large reception area a lovely place to meet that is if we weren t in the friendly bar the proximity to the station for the to the airport was a real bonus as it was only euros to travel there altogether a lovely stay thank you
