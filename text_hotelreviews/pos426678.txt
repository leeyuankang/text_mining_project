we have just checked out from one of the friendliest hotels we ve stayed at in a long time from our initial confirmation of booking to leaving we were treated extremely well we booked nights in one of the executive rooms which was well worth the extra cost the room was clean modern and had the extra terrace view over the belvedere garden and the rest of vienna as a surprise for my wife she was given a free massage voucher which gave me bar time the bar staff were great and a great source of tourist information and a bowl of complimentary peanuts with beer the hotel is a good min walk to the centre of town but the walk isn t boring or unsafe in fact wherever we walked seemed comfortable and safe breakfast time was busy which made us feel like we were in the right place it gave my wife a good chance to people watch and me to ignore my calories while she had a selection of fresh fruit veg local cheeses pastries and the odd omelette i was gorging on the scrambled egg sausages bacon fresh salmon cereal selection fruits etc there was so much more what i m trying to say is that there was nothing inedible it was all great the executive suite also gave us access to the executive restaurant we could access this room during the day for extra snacks drinks prawn cocktail beef wrap chocolate mousse etc which also became a great comfort in our day any way all good thank you austria trend
