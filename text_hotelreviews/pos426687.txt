the staff were excellent and so attentive the man who came and brought our pillows and iron then brought us chocolates every day after he was lovely the room was beautiful comfy bed but would be nice if it was an actual double not two singles but that s not a huge issue we were surprised with free champagne fruit pastries as it was my boyfriends birthday trip which was really kind and so very generous location is fine as long as you don t mind a bit of a walk to things we are both young and enjoy the wandering so it was fine for us
