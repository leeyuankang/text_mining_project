the staff were fantastic from the first minute we are a young couple so on first thoughts we didn t think we would fit in but we were treated exactly the same as anyone else the door staff were friendly and enjoyed a laugh as well the room as lovely although the shower wasn t the best it did what we wanted the location couldn t have been any better we were a tube station or two away from everything we wanted we highly recommend this place perhaps we will visit for another birthday next year
