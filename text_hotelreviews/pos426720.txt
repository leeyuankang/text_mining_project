a very comfortable hotel with a nice bar as we arrived rather late the location next to railwaystation rennweg was excellent as it can reached easily by train from the airport for visiting the city you have to catch a train one stop and change to the u bahn but this too is a very good connection and you re close to the belvedere palais museum
