we liked everything about this hotel the staff are super friendly super efficient the rooms are spacious and likewise the bathroom it is a really peaceful and calm hotel the breakfast which we had included in our price was excellent the tram stop is on the same street just up a bit the journey into the centre is short though longer obviously if you walk but trams are frequent and we just took them there is a brewery called salm on same street and it is not far down from hotel and i can thoroughly recommend it for eating and my husband says the beer is the best and that is praise indeed it is an enormous place with outdoor seating and different levels downstairs we ended up eating there nights out of four do not hesitate in choosing this hotel you will not regret it guaranteed
