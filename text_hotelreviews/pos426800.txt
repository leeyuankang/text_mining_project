every thing i only stayed for one night we were a group of person although we booked at the last minute the staff managed to find us rooms next to each other they even upgrade us to ensure we are next to each other i found that very satisfying we had a lot of luggage they helped taking our luggage to our rooms overall i wished we stayed longer and i would recommend it to any one though it s not central
