everything was very clean except dust in our room very nice breakfast and excellent coffee location was pretty nice according to fact that is located near highway mozart and his grave i do not suggest traveling by car in vienna therefore we used tram that is only minutes walk from the hotel parking is for free big advantage and money saver to be honest i really suggest this hotel we were satisfied except some small details and price is very fair if you want to have a business visit or just leisure stay this is the hotel you have been looking for
