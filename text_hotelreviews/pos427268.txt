kind and polite stuff clean modern room at fair price good location tram station line is just around the corner ride to city centre opera house opernring takes around minutes stations new tram arrives every minutes or so ticket price is euro one way we also used taxi for a few times which costs around euro to city centre there are always a few of them parked right in front of hotel free car parking is a great value compared to most other vienna hotels which charge euro per day we didn t have breakfast included in arrangement so i m not sure what the food quality is
