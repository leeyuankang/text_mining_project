there was really nothing to dislike with the hotel we arrived on dec and our first impressions of the hotel were from the exterior it looked a bit characterless but then i realised that it is a business hotel more than a tourist hotel once inside however everything changed it was warm smart even a little elegant the reception staff were very helpful and courteous the room was wonderful large comfortable quiet with plenty of comfortable chairs to sit on the bathroom was amazing with a fantastic walk in shower it was very clean and had everthing that you would expect from a class hotel the situation of the hotel was also great a short walk from the tram stop with a minute journey to vienna center all in all i would reccomend this hotel without hestitation
