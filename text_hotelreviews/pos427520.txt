the hotel location is excellent minutes away from station westfield shops movies and restaurants staff are friendly helpful efficient we booked a room with a double bed but there were single beds in the room we couldn t access the tv movies music so in the end we were given another room the same size with a bed that looked larger than a kingsize really nice dj music was cool i requested a late checkout after midday gbp each hour until its good to have a choice
