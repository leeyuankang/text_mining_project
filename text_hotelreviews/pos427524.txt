thr room and hotel decor was tired and a bit scruffy the room had a kitchen area no sink but the fridge didn t close and it clearly wasn t for use the bathroom was old fashioned byt clean and usable the bed was very comfortable windows in the room didn t open so as it was v hot we had to use the air con which was fine but the room did smell musty or perhaps a previous guest had smoked in the room overall it was ok but we have stayed at other hotels in the area with similar facilities and felt more comfortable
