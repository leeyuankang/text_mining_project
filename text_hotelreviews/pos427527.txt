the staff were lovely and arranged rose petals on our bed and a small chocolate gift for our anniversary stay they also arranged for my husbands shirt to be ironed so we could make our lunch reservations even though we were too early to check in the staff were very friendly and helpful it is very handy for the central line tube stop and westfield shopping centre
