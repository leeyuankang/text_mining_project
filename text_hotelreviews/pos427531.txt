the staff were very friendly and helpful but the room was terrible in the last floor so it was extremely hot and the ac was not effective at all we had problems with some of the equipment n the room which was never resolved the location of the hotel is perfect near westfield mall and underground station the hotel was extremely clean the gym was excellent i d definitely recommend it but check your room first
