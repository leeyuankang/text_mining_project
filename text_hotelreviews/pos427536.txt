the hotel was truly amazing although i little pricy to what i normally book it had reason to be stunning hotel with excellent bar spa and restaurant facilities the room was exceptional with amazing little extras like a free travel buddy in every room for you to take out instead of using your own data i will most definitely stay here again you can literally walk to all the local bars pubs and restaurants just perfect
