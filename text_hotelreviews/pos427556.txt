the spa was perfect from our arrival to leaving they noted down in the system that it was my boyfriends birthday without me asking and greeted him happy birthday and put balloons and a little cake in the room we had an aromatherapy massage each and we both left feeling revitalised and refreshed the staff were amazing everyone was very welcoming and helpful can not fault anything
