cannot fault anything everything was we didn t use any of the facilities or the spa but if we did i would be very confident they would be excellent the food in particular was superb very friendly staff right the way through comfortable room nicely located with a few minutes walk from the underground and shopping centre this is our second time here and it was just as good as the first and we ll be definately planning a third visit overall it is a high end hotel ideally situated for travel and leisure at an excellent price
