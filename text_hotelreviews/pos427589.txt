everyone in the group is allergic to feathers i always phone the hotel a few days before to request foam bedding most hotels ignore this and we then have to call up and wait before the bedding is changed this is the first hotel i ve stayed in where the bedding was changed before we arrived this made things so much easier and less stressful
