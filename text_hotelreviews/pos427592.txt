this hotel has set a new standard for me the hotel was immaculate it really was the double room was huge absolutely huge and extremely clean beyond clean it was spotless in every inch however all that aside what stood out was the staff i have never seen anything like it every single member of staff would say politely greet you every single one from the receptionist to the waiters in the kitchen to the cleaners have really raised the bar a true credit to themselves in every way i can go on for days about the staff but overall a great stay all round
