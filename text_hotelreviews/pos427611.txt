me and my boyfriend came down for the dentistry expo at london olympia and the hotel is in a gr at position if you re attending anything at the olympia it cost us for a taxi black cab but we realised it was only a minute walk from olympia and westfield shopping centre restaurants so that was a massive positive we stayed in the k suite and it was lovely massive lounge area big bedroom with an amazingly large and comfy bed bathroom with everything you could possibly want the room was great we decided to stay an extra night and the staff changed it over effortlessly they helped us throughout our stay and we couldn t sing their praises any more overall great hotel will definitely return
