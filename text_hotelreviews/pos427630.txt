we had a wonderful trip to london and the k west hotel spa made it complete it had a good location and there was a great welcoming from the staff at every place and the facilities where great in the morning there was a delicious breakfast only something of the card was more than enough but it was also a possibility to take something of the buffet downstairs every night we drank something in the bar there was nice music and it was a lovely and relaxing place on our last evening we spend some time in the spa especially the snowcabine was awesome
