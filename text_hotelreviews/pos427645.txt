i had high expectations of this hotel i wasn t disappointed a real gem of a find the staff were lovely the room was beautiful and the spa was just what we needed to start our day had my favourite breakfast before leaving beds were comfy and the room was very quiet which was lovely after a very busy noisy day ps if you use the spa you just have to do the snow room awesome
