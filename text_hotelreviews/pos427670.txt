the staff made my parents feel extra special by going an extra mile for them the lady at reception during that time was super friendly and even gave us an upgrade the spa was also amazing even though it s quite small it still does an excellent job the room itself is extremely comfortable with a comfy and spacious bed it included a tv and a lounge area with tea amenities you definitely feel at home because of how comfortable it is but with added luxury and a nice modern touch it was clean and neat also
