we received a free room upgrade on our arrival which was a lovely surprise bed was huge room very spacious the scent of all the aromatherapy oils from the spa always hit you when you first walk into the hotel which was divine breakfast was so tasty and room service was brilliant i just wish we had taken advantage of the spa but our itinerary was pretty packed
