i love everything about this hotel clean vibrant hotel great hospitality there is nothing about this place i can fault to be completely honest they have a great bar and restaurant and fantastic spa you can also opt for a quiet room on weekends great for a solo traveller or couple closed to westfield shopping centre and close to many great resturaunts and bars
