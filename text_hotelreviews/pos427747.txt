two minutes from subway and huge westfield shopping centre and minute walk from olympia stadium where we were attending a day event rooms very clean very comfortable and stylish and met all our requirements staff were polite friendly and helpful bar was pleasantly busy without being overly so and great service didn t get a chance to try out the spa but smelled gorgeous whenever the lift doors opened and would make a point of trying it out next time round we had booked two rooms for myself and my son who is in his early and they put us on the same floor a few doors from each other just right close enough to keep in touch but not bug each other he loved the hotel too which suggests it manages to cater to a pretty varied age group but still retains some cool
