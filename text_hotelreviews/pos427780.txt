we booked this hotel after a search for hotels located near to the eventim apollo we found the reception staff to be most helpful the hotel restaurant offers a limited menu choice but the food is well presented and tasty the waitress was very polite and welcoming the bedroom was comfortable albeit we found the wifi signal somewhat slow the hotel has a car park for guests but costs per night however we were allowed to keep our car there after we checked out of the hotel we had decided to spend several hours at the westfield shopping centre that is a minute walk from the hotel
