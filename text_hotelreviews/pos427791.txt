free upgrade to a suite we live on a farm no street lights etc so did not expect to sleep well our room was at the front with an exterior glass wall yet the blackout curtains and the triple glazing made the room very peaceful we had a wonderful night s sleep the bed was huge and very comfortable location excellent for our visit to olympia
