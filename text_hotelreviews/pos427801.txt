the bed was extremely comfy the hotel left us a card and gift for our anniversary which was lovely great location next to the westfield shopping centre where we decided to park and cost us for hours rather than at the hotel really enjoyed the dj on the saturday evening after our meal in the hotel which was reasonably priced
