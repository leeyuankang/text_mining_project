the facilities were excellent it was more like an apartment so a main bedroom and a smaller single bedroom plus a kitchen area great to have a proper coffee machine in the room the location is excellent and next door to the best restaurant we found in vienna puerstner doesn t look much from the street but wait until you go inside a lovely period building steeped in character but with modern facilities would definitely use this hotel again
