the apartment was immaculately clean we asked for a quiet apartment and was offered one it is conveniently located in centre and is close to a bio supermarket full of premium quality organic food the staff have been truly helpful and they have helped in booking concert tickets cruise and train ticket recommending good restaurants we were also impressed that the apartment was thoroughly cleaned and prepared daily whilst some other apartment hotels we have stayed only clean once a week or per visit small details were also looked after such as chocolate were left every day on our pillow we would definitely like to come back and stay in this elegant clean centre apartment hotel if we visit vienna again
