the staff at this hotel was the highlight of our stay we booked this last minute and it was double booked they were able to offer us a solution and they were incredibly apologetic about the whole situation for days the place is nice and clean as well as tastefully decorated i would definitely stay there again it was a great location it was close to the center of action but far away enough to be on a quiet street
