the apartment was in a terrific location in close proximity to st stephans cathedral yet off of the main road so it was very quiet at night the apartment was very clean and it was so nice having it serviced everyday we appreciated that the apartment was cleaned daily and chocolates were left on our pillows we enjoyed our stay very much
