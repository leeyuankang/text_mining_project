beautiful spacious and very confortable apartment in the old centre of vienna so all monuments and museums are at walking distance the bed was very comfortable so we got a good sleep the kitchen area is well furnished for cooking in any case there is a nespresso machine and a kettle with a variety of coffees and teas to chose from we went there during the hot period of the summer so it was good to have air con in both the bedroom and the lounge kitchen area the air con machines are quite noisy so we let them on when we were out and switched them off when we were in very good fish restaurant next door and organic supermarket at the end of this small and quiet street so an excellent location in that respect too staff nice and helpful
