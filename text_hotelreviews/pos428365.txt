good location we had six people the main bedroom was very generous the second room was a lounge room with pull out sofa and that was good the hotel staff were very helpful with sight seeing and local restaurants to try apartment had two bathrooms which was great with the six of us local restaurant recommended was great however a venetian restaurant we attended about blocks away on tourist brochure was overpriced and the food was not great either and the waiter was very rude and arrogant we would stay at the apartment again t
