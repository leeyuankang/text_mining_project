the hotel was lovely and in a perfect area close to the staatsoper the staff was extremely kind and helpful i needed a doctor and called from the train and they managed to organise it all for me even though it was a sunday evening otherwise the room was very nice and clean and we benefitted from the hotel s many facilities
