vienna can be a tricky place to find cute comfy decently priced rooms and this is one place there are a few rooms which means extra staff attention to detail the breakfast was beautiful with staff doing what they can to accommodate you little details matter including new fruit infused water concoctions daily much needed during hot vienna summer days i wish i could have stayed longer and would definitely consider returning
