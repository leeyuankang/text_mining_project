even though i booked small double room the spaces were organized in a comfortable way the design of the room was nicely done in a minimal and relaxing style the bed was very comfortable i really advise you to have a breakfast in the hotel not only because of the good quality of it but also because the atmosphere of the dining room is charming and it s a great way to start your day the position of the hotel is quite central and it s easy to explore the city by foot
