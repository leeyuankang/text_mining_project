the staff is extremely helpful and friendly the room is very well sized the bed is comfortable the bathroom is modern water pressure is good ventilation is good the location is great the hotel is within walking distance to all of the major attractions but if you don t feel like walking the public transportation is very close we arrived in vienna with the train and the hotel is only stops away from the main station we would definitely stay here again
