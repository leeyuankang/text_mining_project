rooms were spacious but very cosy appeared to be extremely clean very friendly staff and a lovely reception area with a free capsule coffee everyday breakfast was very good value for money had a room overlooking the street but it was very quiet code for doors made it feel secure also added bonus chocolate on pillow on arrival very close to the naschmarkt also which is great fun
