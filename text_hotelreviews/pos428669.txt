we had a great stay staff is very professional and friendly very clean hotel and very well designed great kitchen you can make the room completely dark which helps a lot for sleeping we slept very well in good beds and quiet airconditioning the rooftop is an absolute bonus we often go to barcelona because of friends we know there and will definitely go back to this hotel
