amazing boutique hotel we stumbled upon it when in need of last minute accommodation for one night after a very stressful day and it absolutely couldn t work out better the place is beautiful staff extremely attentive without being pushy and every detail is well though out from beautiful toiletries to food to the outside patio and music it was a flying visit for us but will definitely be back highly recommended gem right in the middle of the gothic quarter
