extremely hip hotel in terms of decor and lively bar restaurant in the lobby with reasonably priced food and drink beautiful but accessible without being intimidating or snobby very different than anything i ve seen in barcelona great location in the old city one of my favourite parts nice chill out area on roof staff was great could not be better
