we liked the contemporary decor the bed was comfortable mini bar and in room coffee complementary especially liked that room had both a shower and deep soaking tub the location was perfect the breakfast though an additional cost to room was extensive allowing us to not need lunch we walked nearly everywhere as the hotel is so centrally located
