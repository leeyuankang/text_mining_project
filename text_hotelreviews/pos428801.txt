the hotel was absolutely excellent the facilities were great and the standard of breakfast was first class however what made the hotel stand out above others we ve previously stayed in was the staff they were warm friendly courteous and nothing was too much trouble i even had a cake delivered to the room in recognition of my birthday without any mention to the hotel staff which i thought was a lovely touch we would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in vienna
