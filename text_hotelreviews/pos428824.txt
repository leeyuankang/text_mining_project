the staff are well trained and helpful in all departments the rooms are comfy and neat just one tip stay away from the restaurant around the corner called tricolori the staff are very rude and even started shouting at me because i ordered sparkling water and he brought me sparkling champagne when i told him that i did not order the champs he told me he is sick and tired to walk up and down we paid for our drinks and left it is a pity because it is so close to the hotel i hope the hotel management read my comments so that they don t send there clients there
