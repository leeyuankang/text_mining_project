the check in was decent and the lady who checked us in was quite kind the hotel left us a nice generic letter in the room and gave us some cute little desserts for our celebration they provide complimentary water and some drinks too which is nice the room size is good and spacious with a lot of light the location of the hotel is good very close to the opera house i have stayed at the imperial hotel too with my family which was far more fantastic completely different league but a little further away so if location is very important this is a somewhat okay place to stay as long as you do not expect anything beyond basic service
