all staff were polite and friendly at all times not a single bad experience in the week we stayed here when we had a problem with the tv the technician was with us in minutes to resolve the issue and when we ordered room service the food was delivered in an incredibly short time and was absolutely delicious the hotel room was amazing the pictures on the website don t quite show how lovely it is and the massage shower was incredible overall outstanding service at a lovely hotel
