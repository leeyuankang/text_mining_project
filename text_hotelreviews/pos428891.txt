they could not have done anything more for us we arrived for a three night stay and were able to check in early the staff were extremely friendly and offered us a free upgrade upon arrival i mentioned before arriving that we were on holiday for my husband s birthday to our surprise the hotel arranged a bottle of champagne on our first night with a thoughtful note the location of the hotel is absolutely perfect especially for the opera which is a minute dash across the road on a winter s evening the hotel is very modern and beautifully decorated thank you to all the staff at le meridian for making our stay so special
