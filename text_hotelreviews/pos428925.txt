the location is excellent very close to the metro station shopping area resturants and historical places and opera house and all the tours buses and connections starts from the opera house the staff were very helpful we arrived at night and the hotel was hosting a fashion event and the place was very crowded with people and music the next day we received a message from the management on the room offering us free breakfast for the whole stay as a way of compensation for the inconvient although we didnt complaint about it this was very kind of them i highly recommend this hotel for vienna visitors
