the best things about the staunton hotel were the very helpful friendly staff and the great location especially if you are going to theatre land i can thoroughly recommend the cooked breakfast which seemed to be freshly cooked which is very unusual these days just around the corner from the hotel are a good selection of individual coffee houses and small restaurants
