the hotel is very nice and comfortable it is situated in a great location it s close to oxford st and within a walking distance you can find many restaurants and pubs on the other hand the street is rather quiet so you get a comfortable and relaxed experience the breakfast is good the staff is very nice we forgot to bring some things and they gladly helped us
