all very good only problem we had planned our day around eating at the hotel in the evening the wedding event meant that the restaurant was closed to guests that night it would help to put a notice for people if this is the case so that they can plan accordingly after being out all day we had really wanted to relax and eat at the hotel that night the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel is relaxing and the stylish environment and ambience are fab
