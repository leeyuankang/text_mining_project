comfortable bed clean hotel great location fantastic staff and customer services our first room had a host of problems which couldn t be resolved quickly so the staff gave us a new room immediately which was a lot better they dealt with the matter efficiently effectively and with a lot of care and attention they were really helpful with advice on how to get around the city and other daily touristic queries for the staff training as they are a credit to the hotel and a huge jewel in the crown
