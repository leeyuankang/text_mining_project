what a beautiful hotel the beds are very comfortable the pillows are amazing excellent service and facilities always a truly enjoyable experience location is perfect for exploring different areas of the city especially de pijp with its lovely atmosphere a short walk away from museumplein but also right next to tram stops if you prefer taking public transport plenty of caf s and restaurants around representing all types of different cuisines was upgraded to a more luxurious room during my last visit and really enjoyed the additional amenities will definitely keep returning
