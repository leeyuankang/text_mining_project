this hotel well located for seeing the main museums in amsterdam which are within easy walking distance it is very near to a tram stop thus easy to get to the train station the rooms are stylishly decorated though they are not brightly lit if that is important for you the staff were excellently quickly putting right the minor issues we had with our room we didn t try the restaurant but the cocktails in the bar were pretty good
