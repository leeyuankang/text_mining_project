stayed in a deluxe room and wasn t disappointed room was gorgeous and incredibly spacious bathroom was beautiful booked for a birthday surprise and the staff had left a bottle of wine and birthday message which was a lovely gesture about a minute walk into dam square and close to van gogh and other museums would definitely return enjoyed every minute
