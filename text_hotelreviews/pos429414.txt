the beds were amazing staff very friendly and helpful good location if you want to be away from the red light district quite at night no noise from trams etc quick walk to rembrandtplein right next to vondelpark easy enough access by public transport from airport it was myself and my partners birthdays around the time we travelled and they had balloons and a welcome note in the room upon arrival nice touch
