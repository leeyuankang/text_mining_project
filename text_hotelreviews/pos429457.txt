the room was heated and we could control the temperature ourselves we visited during a cold spell so this was vital the bathroom was great with a nice tub it was spacey in front of the bed and there was good head space our room came with a veranda that i can imagine is very cozy in summer when it doesn t rain the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood
