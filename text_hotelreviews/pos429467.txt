we were given an upgrade to a jacuzzi room which was lovely the location was great and it felt safe walking to and from at night the staff were polite and helpful overall and the coffee maker in the room was a nice touch rooms were clean tidy and serviced daily and the large double bed was really comfortable we were lucky to have a balcony overlooking the gardens at the back which was lovely in the mornings we were in room which was right next to the lift on the floor initially i was concerned about noise but this was not an issue overall a great little hotel
