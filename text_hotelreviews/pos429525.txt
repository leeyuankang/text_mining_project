perfectly located between the museum quarter nine streets and the old town means everything is walking distance the room was luxuriously appointed with dining table and lounge chairs and feeling a little travel weary we even stayed and ordered room service one night the meal was as good as any of the other delightful cafes and bars amsterdam has to offer and the staff were very helpful and charming all round the hotel roemer was a quiet relaxing and thoroughly pleasant place to stay in amsterdam would happily return there again on our next trip
