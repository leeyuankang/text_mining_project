i liked everything however the staff were outstanding and deserve a special mention they could not have made me feel more at home particularly the two girls at reception and the young lady who worked in the bar area i only wish i knew their names but i am sure their manager must be aware of how wonderful they are the room was by far the best i have stayed in in amsterdam and i have visited many times the beds were huge and extremely comfortable and i am already planning a return visit could not rate the place highly enough thanks to all there
