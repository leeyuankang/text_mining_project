the room was big well decorated new and cozy the bathroom was wonderful the bed was huge and comfy and the staff was helpful the breakfast is quite expensive as any hotel in amsterdam but was great and high quality the location was fantastic close enough to walk anywhere but in a quiet lovely street i don t have anything bad to say regarding this lovely hotel
