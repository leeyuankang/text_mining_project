staff was very friendly and kind location of the hotel is good close to almost all points of interest in very nice neighbourhood windows have great sound proof so even there is a school across with kids playing cheerfully we didn t hear voices there is a coffee provided and sometimes even croissants left from breakfast which was very nice and varied double bed was very wide and comfortable hotel is small clean and modern
