the room was lovely it has a modern design and designed for tidiness and efficiency there was a glass panel between the shower and bedroom which we loved however the shower also featured a blind if you d like a bit of privacy the bed was super comfortable and despite the room was small it was all strategically planned breakfast was also delicious with a huge choice to pick from definitely would advise to stay at this hotel
