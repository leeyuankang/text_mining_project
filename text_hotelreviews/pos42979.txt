the location is fantastic within walking distance to oxford street covent garden soho etc it is not a luxurious hotel but it is cosy clean comfortable and well decorated the only downside is that it does not have an elevator it only has three floors though so you will not die rooms are on the small side but i would not expect anything else in that location price quality ratio is very good for london
