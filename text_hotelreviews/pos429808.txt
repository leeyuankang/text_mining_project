this is a new hotel only been open for a couple of months when we stayed everything is clean and fresh and the location is perfect for sightseeing but down a quiet side street so you can sleep undisturbed what makes this hotel really great is the staff nothing was too much trouble they were so kind and helpful i wouldn t hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to other travelers
