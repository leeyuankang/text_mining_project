the staff here was top notch loved the room also spent time on the roof top terrace which was very nice we had coffee at the adjoining coffee bar every day as well as some beers after our long walks the girl waiting on us was so accommodating front desk people were so helpful with directions advise on tapas bars etc the location was great loved the big pillows was a little nervous when booking in a foreign country but this hotel could not have been better would stay again with no hesitation
