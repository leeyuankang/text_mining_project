ideal location at more or less to min from the renown places by taxi friendly welcoming and helpful staff great amenities such as a small but nice fitness room and a splendid rooftop swimming pool get some snacks and a nice bottle of wine for sunset time worth it a must see haven t tried the food or breakfast but seems decent for what i ve seen
