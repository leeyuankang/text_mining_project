nicely decorated apartment in minimalist scandinavian style high ceilings with tall windows let a lot of light into the apartment special mention and thanks to carlos at the front desk who was very friendly and helpful and chatting with him in the morning to get advice directions etc was a great way to start the day metro is only a few steps away which is a big plus
