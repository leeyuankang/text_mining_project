it was so wonderful from the beginning when we checked in the services were so considerable and the attitude was very nice with useful suggestions the hotel and rooms were clean and tidy quiet as well a bus stop is just one minute walk away from the hotel i enjoyed my stay here so much and i will choose it if i go to barcelona again
