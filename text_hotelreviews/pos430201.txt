the location is good very close to metro stations girona and passeig de gracia that we used a lot and a lot of buses arround the hotel it s also pretty close to the center to placa de catalunya walking minutes the staff was really friendly and helpful they knew english and were ready to help us with anything right away at the reception all the waiters and the staff at the breakfast restaurant we ve got a deal with our booking for a day for people for breakfast which was fair enough we tried to get breakfast the first day at the restaurants around the hotel but it did not cover all the option for euros a person plus coffees and juices etc well we eat a lot for breakfast so it was more convenient for us this way there was a great variety for continental breakfast the only minus was the lack of fresh veggies but we survived the pool even if small was awesome really nice view and cool feeling to have a bath on top of the city we were at the pool in the evening after all day walks and it was generally only people at that hour so it was pretty free and very silent the view from our room was really nice we had the window on the front towards the street but if you get one with inside courtyard view it will suck pretty much cause if you open courtains everybody from the elevator will see inside your room the street was extremely nosy but the room had set of doors and it isolated properly we didn t really use the air conditioning as the weated was always pretty windy at our floor and it s been rather chilly during the night with the closed windows the bed was really confortable though rather short wifi was great really happy with that coffee in the lunge is amazing they have computers at floor with internet for clients use where we printed some tickets and the flights was very helpful
