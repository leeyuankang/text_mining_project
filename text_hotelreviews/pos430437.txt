the staff at the front desk were amazing and answered emails promptly that we sent with questions before our stay they even had a toast ready for us upon arrival the breakfast is well worth the price and was amazing as well we loved having cocktails up on the terrace by the pool each evening the staff up there were great too beautiful rooms and what a shower the rooms had a fridge and a little market is right across the street they recommended a restaurant a few doors down on the left and it was exceptional they also booked a tour for us to the sagrada de familia which was an unbelievable place
