the location made travel around the city incredibly easy their main reception made us feel right at home as soon as we had arrived their sangria s in the reception bar were some of the best we had during our entire holiday they made the trip even more special as they surprised my friend who s birthday we were celebrating on the trip by calling to our room on the evening of her birthday with a beautiful cheesecake and candle wishing her happy birthday so thoughtful i can t wait to come back and stay again
