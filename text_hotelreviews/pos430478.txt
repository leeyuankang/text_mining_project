excellent all the staff were first rate and all the extra details in the room were considered and thoughtful to make the stay a good one i was given a free upgrade to higher rating room and was very pleased with that thankyou as a solo traveller i have often been made to feel like a secondclass citizen when checking in to a hotel in complete contrast the staff here made me feel like i was genuinely welcome and the difference was really noticeable i highly recommend this hotel
