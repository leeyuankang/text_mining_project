the rooms were fantastic much more than we expected the bed was huge so was the shower a fantastic roof terrace with even better views of the city very relaxing way to end the day very friendly helpful staff too we would certainly stay here again there is also a delicious deli a few doors down for your very own picnic of the roof terrace
