great central location but quiet enough street to not be very noisy at night two metro lines within minute walk many places to eat around friendly staff fantastic breakfast available with almost everyting still available also at minibar was minimally stocked but complimentary and it is really nice to be able to have a drink coming home late without every water costing euros like other hotels charge
