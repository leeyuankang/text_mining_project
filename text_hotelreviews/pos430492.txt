the staff at the hotel are amazing and added to a fantastic experience from guidelines on routes to booking tickets for football they are helpful in whatever you need this over and above the friendly and welcoming nature that all reception personnel demonstrated a special mention for the shower in the room which was excellent wonderful stay in barcelona at a fantastic hotel
