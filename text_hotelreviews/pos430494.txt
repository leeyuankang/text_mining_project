from the moment we arrived the quality of the hotel was obvious from the welcome drinks to the friendly staff the location is absolutely perfect luxury rooms and fantastic roof terrace they were having some work done in reception which didn t disturb us at all but to compensate they invited all guests to a free buffet for two nights that s quality service would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all
