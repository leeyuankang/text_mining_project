great location in the centre of barcelona and just a few minutes walk from the coach station to airport at catalunya plaza beautiful and modern style room was very lucky to get a free upgrade to superior room with the street view outside room was spacious and clean with large double bed breakfast is quite nice although there may be limited choices but still good enough for a four star hotel rooftop bar and pool have incredible view of sunset
