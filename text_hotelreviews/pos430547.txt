clean and modern hotel amazing showers we really enjoyed the roof top patio pool great drink menu we enjoyed drinks up here twice during our stay central location you can walk to everything you need to in barcelona it is a bit of longer walk to the beach port though probably about mins staff were extremely friendly really enjoyed the welcome glass of cava we had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary when we returned from site seeing on the first day we found a bottle of cava on ice and a plate of chocolates sweets on our bed with a note thanking us for celebrating with them we cancelled a more expensive room at the last minute at chose negressco absolutely no regrets we actually ended up booking this hotel again for our last night before flying home
