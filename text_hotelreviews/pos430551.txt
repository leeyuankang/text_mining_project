the location was excellent only a few minutes from the main thoroughfare the bedroom was modern and spacious with excellent air con the staff were vey helpful and friendly the rooftop bar was a real bonus also the hotel really made an effort to add that little personal touch it was my boyfriends birthday during our stay and they brought complimentary desserts to our room with a birthday candle and everything
