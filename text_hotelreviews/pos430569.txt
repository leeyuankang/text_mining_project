absolutely awesome stay great location the staff was very kind and helped us with all the questions we had the pool is really nice specially to unwind after walking around the city the rooms are spacious and clean but my favorite thing about this hotel was the showers they had really nice pressure and were really modern also it s really close to an aerobus stop so transportation to and from the airport was convenient and cheap around euros per person
