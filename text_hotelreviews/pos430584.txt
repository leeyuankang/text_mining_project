this hotel was in a great location for accessing on foot those parts of barcelona we wanted to visit and was also just a few minutes walk from a metro station when we wanted to travel further afield the staff were all very helpful and friendly the choice at breakfast is very good including some hot food the bed was very comfortable the minibar in the room was free which was a nice touch we were only in barcelona for nights and realised there was much of the city we didn t get to we will have to return and when we do we would definitely consider staying in the negresco princess again
