great location friendly and helpful staff breakfast superb roof top pool and views great we spent a lazy sunday afternoon up there we took our drinks up there and the roof top bar doesn t open til approx this is a lovely star hotel i have visited barcelona on occasions now the only thing that needs improving is the room service as the food was luke warm i would reccomend staying here and i personally would stay here again
