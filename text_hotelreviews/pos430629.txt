the view from our upgraded room was amazing sun woke us up with a smile each morning shining through the window waterfall shower was amazing red rose left on bed for sant jordi day was a brilliant touch saving the best till last would have to be the rooftop pool and bar terrace the view from this is absolutely unreal you can see both tibidabo on top of the mountain and the sagrada famalia
