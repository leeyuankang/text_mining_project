the hotel is in an excellent location it s modern very clean and contemporary the staff are extremely friendly the breakfasts were excellent with a great selection the rooftop bar was lovely and again with great staff the room was finished off very well and the shower was fantastic the free mini bar was a nice touch the airport transfer bus drops off and picks up about a minute walk away i would highly recommend this hotel when we return to barcelona this will be the first hotel we ll check for availability
