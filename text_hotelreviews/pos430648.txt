the bed was incredibly comfy and despite our short day stay we didn t want to get out of it the staff were excellent and very helpful and the location was incredible very central and less than minutes from the central square to young couples travelling i would suggest using the aerobus which is very frequent to get to and from the airport it drops you off in the centre of the city and is much cheaper than a normal transfer with minimal waiting around for return
