staff excellent and friendly i got a double luxury room i believe it is called and let me tell this was literally the tiniest room i ve ever been in the only reason i got it because it was half off from quite a number thinking i will get some extra comfort on a luxury room boy was i wrong i can only imagine what the standard room is like maybe itil is ok for a couple of penguins also i made a nice video of the window trim missing and exposing the construction part underneath quite ugly the door slams like a mother and will keep you awake at night poor mini bar choice otherwise a decent looking boutique hotel
