the location of the hotel is ideal not in the center which is noisy and a little dirty but in the next neighbourhood where you are close to everything the hotel is brandnew and the beds the matrasses and the pillows are lovingly supersoft you just do not want to get up also the girls in the reception are very kind smiling and always helpful
