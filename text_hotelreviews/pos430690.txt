this hotel is fabulous from start to finish we arrived at we were allowed to check in early the receptionist was very friendly pleasant the hotel and rooms are very modern the shower is amazing it has a massive head almost like a walk in shower the breakfast was amazing with so much choice also when i asked if they had gluten free bread they got me a lovely roll and also a chocolate muffin the rooftop pool area is so pretty and tranquil although it was too chilly to swim for us i cannot fault this hotel and if i ever go to barcelona again i will definitely stay here
