our stay in petit palace was short but wonderful the staff were incredibly helpful every step of the way even in matters not concerning the hotel when we first arrived they were quick to help us navigate the parking zones and led us to a convenient parking spot right in front of the hotel even after we had checked out we were able to use their common areas to help us prepare for the next leg of our journey and again they were there to lend a helping hand the room was very spacious and the view from the balcony was fantastic easy walk to sagrada familia las ramblas and approximately a minute walk from the gothic quarter
