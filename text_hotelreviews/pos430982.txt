great hotel central location staff was very helpful and friendly we stayed in a family room with a double bed and a sofa bed and the room was huge we stayed for one night only but we loved it we did not have breakfast included but we had no problems finding a breakfast place close by in fact there was a nice caf right outside the hotel we did not try it
