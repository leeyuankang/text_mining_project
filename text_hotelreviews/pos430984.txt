the location of the hotel is great it being in the city center and a few minutes away from the main squares and streets the shops and cafeterias nearby are lovely the staff were very friendly despite us arriving earlier than at the designated check in time they tried their utmost to get us accommodated early the breakfast was varied and delicious there is also the opportunity to rent the bikes for free
