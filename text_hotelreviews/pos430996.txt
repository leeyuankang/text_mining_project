we stayed in a petit palace in madrid and barcelona and have become big fans of this brand of lodging petite palace barcelona is a great hotel friendly staff nice location we were a family of two rooms and used petit palace as a springboard to see barcelona easy to walk to the train or downtown sites great breakfast we would definitely return
