the hotel was good we stayed in the family room nights with cozy and pleasant atmosphere it was very comfortable the staffs were very helpful and accommodating they made my son s b day special by putting greeting cards stuff toy and lollies in our room while we were away it was a pleasant surprised for my yr old son when he saw what i like about this property is the location it is centrally located to most places there s a pharmacy next door supermarket surrounded with restaurants and few steps away to taxi stand if your concern is the accessibility to the main areas then i highly recommend this hotel the premises is also safe and secured
