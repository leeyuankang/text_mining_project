the location is excellent and the customer service even better there are several larger and more modern hotels close by but this one made you feel like you were at home small and personal one front desk attendant even made me a complimentary bag lunch complimentary use of computer and printer in lobby appreciated balcony altho not much of a view was also very nice to have
