the man working on the reception desk during our stay was helpful beyond belief taxi s were on strike across barcelona and we had to travel an hour out of barcelona to our second destination clueless we asked for help and he looked into all alternative travel arrangements organised and explained the metro system to us looked at hire cars for us and gave us train bus and metro times to get us to where we needed to be can t be any more complimentary about the service the hotel overall is great for the money and we enjoyed our stay
