nice newish clean room not very big but plenty of storage space a balcony bathroom is big modern a spacious wifi is decent capped though so do not expect watching videos and no need to re enter your personal access code just works also wifi was given on arrival without a reminder breakfast is very decent and runs until which was perfect for us room was overlooking the back and it was very quite even with window open location is really good airport transfer on bus was a breeze with mins walk from the bus stop most sites are in walking distance too but several metro lines are easily accessible
