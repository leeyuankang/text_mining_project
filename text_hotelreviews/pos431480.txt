the staff on check in were very friendly and helpful we had booked a separate room for our teenage sons and had requested a twin close to our room as they didn t have a twin room available they upgraded us to junior suites so they could be adjacent to us and use the sofa bed as the second bed very thoughtful the pool and outdoor sun deck although small was perfect to chill on after a day walking around the city they also have a buffet selection of hot and cold snacks available for free from a very nice touch the hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing etc
