from its street appearance you would not expect much from this property the street frontage is small and unpretentious once you are inside you are in for a surprise our room was spacious and had two balconies the walk in shower was luxurious an unexpected bonus was the free buffet they put out from to p m but the best part was the attentiveness of the staff we had planned to meet a tour guide in the plaza catalonia but we were unsure about how to identify him so the bellboy actually walked with us to the plaza and found our guide in the crowd of people in this very busy plaza
