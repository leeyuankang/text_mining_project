staff were amazing so helpful and friendly we had two junior suites next to each other for our family trip which worked very well large rooms well equipped and very clean free afternoon buffet was fantastic especially arriving back after a day in the city the location couldn t be better we especially liked wandering around the main square in the evening very relaxing the hotel is also brilliantly located for shopping either independent or designer brands as well as all of the amazing cultural experiences on offer
