location was phenomenal no problems with noise despite being on a major street in a heavily trafficked part of town staff very friendly and eager to help even late at night breakfast was delicious spacious room with free water every day hotel has free snacks sandwiches cookies fruit etc available from late morning until late at night every day amazing little perk and great for tiding one over until late spanish dinners would be delighted to stay here again
