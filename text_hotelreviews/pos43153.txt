the position for public transport was excellent the metro is right there so we could get around paris super easy the room was very small but had everything we could need the staff where very helpful and even arranged to change our room as the first one was on the road and we like to open our windows at night while we sleep there where quick to change and the new room was perfect they had an awesome restaurant on the premises and a funky little night club at the back which was an awesome surprise
