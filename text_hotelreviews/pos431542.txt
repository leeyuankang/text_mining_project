the entire hotel has a very modern style and is very clean great location as we visited many of the sites in barcelona without using a bus or taxi we only took a taxi for the sagrada familia and to get to the beach also the room we were in provided a second door in the entry way of our room that we used at night to help silence any noise by other guests not sure if the second door was necessary but we never heard any noises from other guests
