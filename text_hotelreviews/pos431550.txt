both rooms were beautifully clean and well maintained the beds were comfortable although very tightly tucked in making it difficult to get under the covers afternoon snacks were generous tasty and very welcome great location for central barcelona la rambla shopping tours cafes etc beach was not so close but cheap in a taxi
