the staff was very helpful and acommodating our room was very stylish and had a comfy bed what impressed me most was that while we did have breakfast included in the cost of our room they had a free light buffet for all guests from noon until m which we took advantage of also we had some large luggage with us and they agreed to store of our bags for several days free of charge while we took a short trip north on the train before coming back to barcelona great location and great hotel
