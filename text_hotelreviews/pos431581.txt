when we arrived we were warmly welcomed the check in was quick and smooth we were taken to our room which was on the floor it was one of only two rooms in the hotel with a balcony this provided the most amazing place to relax at any time of day the view was great and was generally a nice place to sit the size of the room was brilliant plenty of space for us to relax when we weren t out in the city in comparison to other hotels i ve stayed in the features were just that bit better the tv size kettle iron ironing board and the desk area that allowed us to explore the maps for places to visit just made the experience that bit better my main positives would be the proximity we were able to walk to the square in less than a minute this is where the best shops restaurants and travel links were including two metro stations tour buses and taxis unlike other hotels it offered breakfast to and then a free buffet from this was great for us as we could grab some food and then relax in the pool the pool was quiet and had it to ourselves most of the time this was also the same for the gym which was very well air conditioned much like the room a real little bit of paradise in the centre of an amazing city i ll be visiting again in the future
