close to everything metro is a mere minute walk bed and pillows were very comfy the room and bathroom is large we were in the higher floor with a view of plaza catalunya and very quiet despite facing the main street getting from the main reception area to our room wa a bit confusing at first but we managed to get used to it the breakfast buffet was very good and the snacks from offered free by the hotel was very convenient after a day of walking and sightseeing i would not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are in barcelona i would like to thank the following staff at reception aleix jordin kenia and two more i can t remember their names they were very friendly and accommodating whenever we have questions love that the hotel is brand new only years old i hope the management maintains the standards of service and care delivered for the years to come
