we were very satisfied with the hotel the staff is very friendly the location is excellent and the room looks exactly as on the pictures the room has everything that you need for a couple of days and it was perfectly clean air condition works very well the bed was extra confortable i would definately suggest to choose this hotel if you prefer to stay in a good hotel for a bit higher price but knowing that you will spend quality time there
