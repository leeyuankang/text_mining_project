catalonia square sup is a nice modern hotel location is very convenient very close to the main attractions but on a quiet street the stuff is very friendly and helpful they gave me very good advice about where to eat and it was fantastic best routes to get to different places at the best price the hotel is clean so i can say they did their best to make my staying there pleasant and comfortable
