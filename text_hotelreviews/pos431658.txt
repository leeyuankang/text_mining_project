staff was very pleasant and helpful location was convenient for sightseeing and train and bus transportation including the bus to the airport very impressed by the thoroughness of the accommodations everything had been considered by the designers including a built in adapter in the safe for electronic devices which i particularly appreciated since i had unintentionally left my european adapter at another hotel also liked the firm mattress on the bed afternoon buffet at no charge was a delightful surprise
