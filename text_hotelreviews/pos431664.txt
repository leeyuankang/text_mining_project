i loved everything about this hotel i moved here from a hotel and it was way better on every level the staff were pleasant helpful and very friendly the location was wonderful central and easily accessible the pool though small is nice and the afternoon snacks are a nice touch for guests most importantly the rooms are very very clean and bright i am fussy about hotels especially bathrooms but was very very pleased with this hotel
