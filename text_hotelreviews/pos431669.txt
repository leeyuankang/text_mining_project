the hotel is extremely well located and central to everything just steps away from pla a de catalunya it was easy to get to from the airport using the aerobus just person each way the staff was amazing each staff members were so nice and helpful and went out of their ways to make us comfortable the rooms were very clean comfortable and quiet i would highly recommend and will definetely stay there again if i ever come back to barcelona
