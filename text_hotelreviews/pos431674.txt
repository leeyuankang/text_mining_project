could not have been a better hotel for my family of including older children and grandmother sleek very clean modern with large lounge dining area all day buffet great for hungry tourists breaking schedules in the warm weather location just off catalunya square at the top of las ramlas and bordering the gothic quarter is terrific lots to do especially for history arts buffs within minutes strolling in all directions free walking tours offered a big plus many hotel choices in the city look no further than this hotel
