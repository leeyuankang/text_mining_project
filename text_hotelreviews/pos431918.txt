a nice and very clean hotel in a great location with helpful and friendly staff the size of the room was ok closets and shelves were big enough the room has all of the expected amenities such as good wifi safety box fridge espresso machine tea maker they don t save on the small things so you get tooth brushes extra glasses etc the complimentary cookies a couple of bottles of water tea bags espresso and milk capsules were a nice gesture the bar on the roof has a great view i would stay here again
