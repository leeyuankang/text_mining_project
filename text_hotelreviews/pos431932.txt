the hotel was perfect for us we didn t include breakfast or dinner and didn t dine in the hotel restaurant as we prefer to eat at one of the many cafeterias restaurants in the city so we can t comment on the food in the hotel restaurant the hotel is in an excellent location staff were very friendly helpful the room was very comfortable clean the room was cleaned to a high standard on a daily basis a fantastic base for a very enjoyable visit to the marvelous city of barcelona
