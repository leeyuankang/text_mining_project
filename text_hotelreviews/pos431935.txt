it s close to every point in bcn you can go anywhere by foot there are great restaruants few blocks away and you can also easily find nearby convenient store i visited rooftop terrace at around midnight and even though they were not offering any service i could still enjoy night view with comfy chairs it was open but no staff was there also it was very quite while we are staying
