nice friendly staff staff at reception recommended a nice sea food restaurant along the marina and what a great choice indeed the best sea food place we have eaten so far hands down we thoroughly enjoyed it and the food was just amazing sorry i lost the business card and i can t remember the restaurant s name it was a positive experience from an otherwise unpleasant start of the evening for on our way to the marina we had an unpleasant experience with the taxi driver who drove us there the drive was plain rude and very aggressive at one point he and another driver were arguing with each other bec our diver had cut him off we felt uncomfortable and was getting scared we wanted to get off from the cab luckily we reached the marina in one piece without getting into an accident not only was the driver rude and unfriendly he also overcharged us for the fare by pressing the meter more than once so we ended up paying euros more than we should when we got back to the hotel we reported the incident at the front desk since they were the ones who called the taxi for us christian fernandez the hotel s concierge called the taxi company and relayed our bad experience with the supervisor the next morning christian informed us that the taxi company supervisor reimbursed our fare and apologized for the driver s erratic driving and rudeness what a big surprise i did not expect to be refunded for the fare but we were very appreciative this is what i call great service and being attentive to the guest needs i would recommend this hotel to anyone i will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if and when i return to barcelona
