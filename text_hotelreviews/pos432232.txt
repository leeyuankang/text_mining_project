the rooms were nice and reasonably big bathroom was very nice we had one with a bath tub our hotel was on the first floor with view on the courtyard not so nice but nothing to complain about breakfast was good serving personnel was friendly and there was never the issue of too less food the room was clean and very nicely heated personnel in general was very friendly and helpful the location of the hotel is very good about meters away from the underground and bus station i can recommend this hotel for shorter and longer visits
