i am globally satisfied by the stay at hotel regina it represents a good compromise between quality and price the standard double room was not very big and the one in which we stayed had just a view on an internal cavedio but it was clean and quiet breakfast is more than appropriate the hotel is in a very good location to reach the city center well connected to metro and tram at walking distance a car parking is at a walking distance as well the wifi sometimes does not work properly but it is ok for a short stay
