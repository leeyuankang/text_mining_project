best air conditioning for a hotel ever i would sleep in a freezer if i could and the fact that i could cool my room right down was aces quality of the food in the restaurant was great the museum like displays on all the floors were interesting beds were comfortable location was right next to sigmund freud park and was just out of the way of the main hustle so as to make the nights quiet for a city centre would definitely come back
