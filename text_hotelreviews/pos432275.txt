nice decor nice staff good location close to public transport and just minutes straight walking to hofburg michaelerplatz very good breakfast except for the coffee the room was totally soundproofed the view from my window was the courtyard but i had only booked a standard room the restaurant in the hotel roth serves very good wiener schnitzel at an average price you really don t have to look elsewhere to try the wiener schnitzel i have tried quite a few hotels in vienna so far this has been the best
