the hotel was in a great location close to metro and walking distance to many monuments and churches it was a little old but clean we got an older room maybe because we stayed only one night we had already been in vienna and stayed at another hotel which was to my opinion much better the photos on the internet look great maybe if it was for a longer stay the hotel would have giving me a larger room but for one night it was fine the staff was nice and the breakfast was nice also
