at this hotel i received the best customer service i have ever had or could ever imagine there were two alejandros at the front desk evening alejandro made me laugh and smile every time i saw him he helped me with a technological glitch that i encountered when trying to book a tour he would not let me leave the hotel without a map and clear directions on the one rainy day he would not let me leave without an umbrella morning alejandro took pity on me when our airport shuttle did not show up i was panicking about missing our flight and he kept me calm and helped me to hail a cab we made it with three minutes to spare i could go on and on about how they made me feel special and cared for in every way
