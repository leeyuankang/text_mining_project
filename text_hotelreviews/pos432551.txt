the location is amazing enriqo granados is one of my fav streets in barecelona and quiet yet at the heart of the city and you could walk anywhere the economy room had an ample space for a solo traveller and bed very comfortable i personally didn t have issues with the sound proofing of room wifi is great and strong bathroom super clean and big
