good location near enough to areas of interest but away from the crowds friendly staff who speak excellent english and provide good customer service not the bored indifference sometimes found in city hotels clean modern hotel large room with superb bathroom minimalist but comfy decor good temperature control our room at the rear of the hotel was very quiet did not explore the gym or pool and had breakfast elsewhere on the go so cannot comment on these
