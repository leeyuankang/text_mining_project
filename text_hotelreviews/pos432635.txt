it was my second time in barcelona so my opinion is based by compering to my previous experiance in different hotel the same standard quiet hotel good location min from metro station diagonal however in min walk you can get to sagrada familia good breakfast and staff was very friendly in the neibrhood you can find restaurants with very good local food we had great time i recommend it
