the gallery hotel was everything we expected the hotel was clean and modern the staff was very helpful in making recommendations for dinner and booking tickets for local events great restaurants and attractions were within walking distance lots of taxis in the area and the metro stop is on the corner of the block lots of options i would highly recommend this hotel for couples families traveling with teenage children or for business travelers it had everything we needed would love to stay here again next time we are in barcelona
