the staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly and cheerful all the time nothing was too much trouble we particularly enjoyed the well presented little touches in our very comfortable superior room from coffee and tea making facilities unusual in spain lovely range of toiletries and useful information about barcelona to chocolates on the pillows at night there was even a small savoury snack of local delicacies waiting in our room when we arrived we were also loaned a dongle by the hotel so we had secure roaming data for the duration of our stay which was very handy indeed location is excellent its a lovely area and within walking distance to most attractions but the metro station is only about away if that and easy to navigate so it is easy to get around the city lots of places to eat and drink close by as well we did not eat in the hotel at all as we don t do breakfast and were out and about in the evenings we loved the hotel and barcelona and will definitely be back
