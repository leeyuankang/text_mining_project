probably the perfect location to get around barcelona whether by taxi metro or walking also the hotel location puts you directly between a buzzing atmosphere of places to shop eat and drink the hotel itself is very welcoming and accommodating only thing that surprised me about the hotel really was the use of the standard key versus electronic magnetic key cards
