larger than expected accommodations for spain we had a family room which was actually two rooms joined by a small entry way perfect for the kids to have their own space and adults to have theirs exceptionally good staff very clean hotel with comfortable beds great location just off rambla de catalunya about a min walk to placa de catalunya or min walk to the born definitely not cheap but priced right for what the hotel delivers
