staff were lovely at all times i really liked the fact they would proactively call to see if there was anything we needed for example a dinner booking or recommendations i have never experienced that previously and it was an excellent touch that made our experience even more enjoyable my partner also loved the dresser in the bathroom where she could get ready each day
