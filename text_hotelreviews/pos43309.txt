the staff looked after us very well as it was our anniversary weekend they arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room for when we arrived the room was beautifully decorated and very clean and comfortable the location of the hotel was amazing and we walked everywhere without the need for public transport i would absolutely stay at the hotel again and i would recommend it anyone
