staff were really lovely and keen to help with anything the rooms were generally clean and comfortable perfect location the rooftop bar was a particular highlight with gorgeous panoramic views over barcelona great for relaxing after a long day walking exploring the city most attractions were accessible on foot from here which was a major bonus
