jon at the reception was very kind and very helpful and explained everything with much patience and even explained us about the city locations and drew on a map what is where to see so he left a great impression as did the view from the room that we paid extra for that view of course exactly as expected sagrada familia from your bed floor room the interior design was very pretty as advertised had dinner at the rooftop terrace and it was extremely delicious breakfast buffet was very delicious and generous a pity it isn t served at the roof terrace but at some random dining area downstairs took it to the room the night before asked if it is possible to take breaks to the rooftop terrace and was told yes upon arriving with a huge tray to the cumbersome door of the said rooftop it was locked what a bad surprise in a hotel that otherwise was almost perfect
