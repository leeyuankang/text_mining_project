wonderful hotel friendly staff great location the roof top terrace which had views of sagrada famillia was just a beautiful place to relax at anytime of the day or night the buffet breakfast offered plenty of variety the additional option to order hot food from the kitchen for no extra cost was an added bonus the location of the hotel is super just a minute from sagrada famillia hop on hop off bus and the metro gaudi s avenue is less than mins walk away there are plenty of good quality resutrants within a short distance of the hotel offering a range of different cusines too the hotel staff were very good at recommending good places to eat within a short distance of the hotel
