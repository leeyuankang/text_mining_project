staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel is close to the sagrada familia metro stop so i d recommend getting the hola bcn travel card if you are planning on sightseeing it also covers airport travel and we used it every day good value for money and it will help you cover much more of the city if you are only there for a few days like we were the hotel is also a great location for seeing the sagrada familia i d suggest booking your tickets online beforehand and trying to get there first thing we visited the church early on a monday morning although it was in february and the crowds were more manageable it was getting much busier when we were leaving in the early afternoon
