the bed was very firm which was perfect after many hours of walking the nights we spent there the location was great because it is near familia sagrada the hotel was clean and everything functioned well it was very quiet which was important to us the breakfast was great and the concierge and breakfast staff were very kind and responsive we asked for tickets to be printed for a reservation for dinner to be made and for a cab to be called every request was met with a smile and action we really enjoyed the tranquil and kind atmosphere of this hotel we would stay again
