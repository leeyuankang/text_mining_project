great staff very service minded classy typical paris style hotel we did not feel like tourist at all at this hotel it wasn t crowded like many other hotels and it gave us that paris feeling we hoped for the location couldn t have been better just besides one of paris nicest places la place de vendome quite street outside of the hotel the bed was very comfortable but it was a twin bed that was made as a double bed and we had to push the two beds together sometimes because they slipped apart while we slept making a gap between the two beds the breakfast was good we recommend having a deluxe room as the standard rooms are small according to some of the guests we met there
