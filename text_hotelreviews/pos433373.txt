the reception staff were a credit to the hotel chain and an excellent representation of the hotel itself tasteful comfortable rooms the roof terrace was a peaceful haven beautifully furnished and offering spectacular views of the sagrada familia in an area away from the hustle and bustle of the centre of barcelona but within very close proximity of the metro and bus stops safe underground parking a bonus
