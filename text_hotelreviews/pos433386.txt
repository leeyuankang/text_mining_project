the terrace on the floor was really nice i wish the bar had been open the two times we were up there over the weekend but alas no such luck maybe in the summer high season the proximity to the familia sagrada is as good as they say it is if you do a tour you can leave the hotel at and you will be perfectly on time the room was an ok size for two people and the bathroom and shower were a good size too with moderate amenities
