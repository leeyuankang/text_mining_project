nice music piped throughout the hotel modern look just around the corner from la sagrada familia so much to discover within walking distance with minute walk you can find great restaurants and shopping breakfast is a big spread including lots of hot items on offer the grilled vegetables are fantastic upgraded to room with view could hear the church bells beautiful just know that the view is just the top of the sagrada familia as there are apartments on the street at the back of the hotel blocking the full view parking on site is a real bonus at per day makes it very convenient
