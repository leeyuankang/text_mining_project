the staff were warm and very helpful upon arrival we were greeted by davide who spoke to us in spanish on request and english to help us out we asked him for his recommendations of places to eat in the area and added some of our own and he told us the best way to travel to each of them very helpful we were offered several choices of rooms for the same price and allowed to pic our preference overall that was a great start
