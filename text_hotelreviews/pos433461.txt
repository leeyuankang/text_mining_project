this hotel has a great location right beside the sagrada familia great roof top area for drinks and tapas bring your own does not seem to be a problem especially when there is a spar around the corner great restaurants are within the square and you can walk to la rambla within an hour totally a flat walk great local bar offering the cheapest tapas basque bar in barcelona hotel is only minutes from airport and roughly euros
