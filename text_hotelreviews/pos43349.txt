the area that the hotel was in it allowed us to be able to walk everywhere we wanted to from the arc de triumph to sacre coeur and we are oaps the reception staff were exceptional they went out of their way to solve any problems that we had and nicholas was a total gem sending me to his own opticians when i had a problem with my glasses a bonus when it was only a couple of minutest away the deluxe superior room was recently refurbished quiet and extremely comfortable the bedding and towels were changed every day the hotel exceeded my expectations and i would certainly recommend it
