i researched numerous paris hotels and chose hotel westminster because it looked traditional and lovely and was in a good location for us what we received was all that and much more unexpectedly i needed something translated from german to english and the concierge found someone in the hotel who helped me immediately and i got help i needed at the small business center off the lobby also i left some possessions in the room after checking out and i received an email from the hotel before i realized that i had left them the price for on on line offering was at a deep discount so i did not expect to have one of the larger rooms pictured on their website but the bathroom was large which was helpful to us our room was quiet although near the place de l opera i was amazed how many paris hotels are advertised with photos of stark furnishings bathed in neon colored light if you share my aversion to that version of sleek you might appreciate westminster as much as we did
