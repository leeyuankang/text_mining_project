hotel westminster is a lovely old hotel with a classic french style about it the bedroom was welcoming and comfortable with a large bathroom it is perfectly located within walking distance to jardins tulliere the louvre and place de la concorde there are a couple of metro stations within a few minutes walk but we used the bus a lot only minutes walk to the stop extremely friendly staff and we would certainly stay again on another visit to paris
