the hotel is at a nice location the staff was very attentive the hotel is in an old building and nicely renovated we stayed in a suite room the decoration was fantastic there were marble chandeliers chimneys old vases english style wallpapers and chairs the bathroom was also spacey looking nice with double wash basins shower and bath tube although we couldn t dine there the hotel restaurant caledon and pub duke s bar are highly recommended all in all it is a nice hotel with a very good ambiance except the water temperature issue
