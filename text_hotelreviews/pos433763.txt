when you first arrive upon check in they supply you with a map of the local area and metro system and local tourist attractions the rooms were very nice and clean the beds were very comfortable and large overall the place was very nice very convenient to local attractions within walking distance to la pedrera not a very large hotel which gives it the more personal feel
