everything was just absolutly perfect it s the second time we visited imlauer and we were not let down the rooms are great the beds are really comfortable the staff are amazingly nice and the breakfast and coffee is just great the hotel is in walking distance from the old city including the stephans dom but there is also a few public transport options closeby this is a really great place to stay when visiting vienna
