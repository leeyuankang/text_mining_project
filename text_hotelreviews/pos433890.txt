we selected this hotel because of its price and advertised amenities we did not require its having a restaurant but did want a bar so this met our needs coming in and exceeded our expectations after spending nights our room was very comfortable as were the beds the staff was excellent in making recommendations for three restaurants that were within a quick walk which was important in the very cold and somewhat wet weather we encountered i have written reviews of these three on trip advisor leopold skopik lohn and el hans while we did order breakfast in the room on one morning we enjoyed venturing out into the neighborhood for breakfasts on the other mornings just pastries coffee tea and yogurt
