the location was excellent mins from tube and walkable to several locations kensington palace albert hall knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile we received a complimentary upgrade on the room bed was lovely and comfortable hotel was lovely staff friendly and attentive as is just off main road nice and quiet can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need i always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes i would you ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why lovely hotel for a special occasion
