the hotel is very near a metro station and one line takes you into the centre of vienna what i particularly liked about this hotel is that it is not in the centre amongst a million other tourist hotels and tourists but is in a neighbourhood where real people live so you get a sense of the city from a more authentic angle pleasant enough neighbourhood too although there are not many viennese restaurants around the best i found was leopold essen trinken which is quite near and has an outdoor eating area beside a church my room was also nice and quiet which i appreciated hire a bike and cycle through the lovely long island park between the danube and the canal
