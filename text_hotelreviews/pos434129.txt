everything was fantastic with the room staff and location all being perfect for a city break the check in process was very easy with the staff offering great advice in what to see in vienna when we arrived in the room after being out for a couple of hours there was even a personalised note welcoming ourselves and a pair of complimentary macaroons to enjoy a lovely touch the room was a high specification and the shower alone deserves a rating all in all perfect
