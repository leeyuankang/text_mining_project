what a surprise this is a fantastic hotel with the most comfortable beds i have ever slept on for eons our room had a bath in the room and the shower was over in the wall with the loo tucked nicely in a little hide hole it was compact but it was funky and fun with lovely chocolates to taste rooftop bar is a must to have a drink and see the views cafe downstairs and great coffee will stay again for sure
