the location was perfect for what we needed it was literally a walk from royal victoria dlr line station and across the river from the which was ideal the hotel staff were so friendly and it felt as if they cared the hotel was immaculate and the rooms had so many useful facilities such as a genuinely good hairdryer and plenty of complementary toiletries
