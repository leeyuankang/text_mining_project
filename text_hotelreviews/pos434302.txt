it s was boyfriends birthday so they had decorated the bed with some rose petals and given him a cake which was really nice when i was leaving my boyfriend packed my things for me so when i got home i realised that i didn t have my laptop or my phone charger and i called the hotel really early in the morning and they picked up and they had retrieved both my items for me which was great the location was nice next to emirates and they gave us a late check out time which was fantastic since we didn t have to rush
