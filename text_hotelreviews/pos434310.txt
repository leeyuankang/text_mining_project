i am really fussy when it comes to hotel accomodation but i can honestly say this was fab i loved it it was super clean the bed was super comforatble i loved the pillows they were excellent not too hard and not too soft and i loved the breakfast it was superb this hotel was well worth the money i did get it at a reasonable rate too
