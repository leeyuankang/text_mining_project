i have stayed at other spa hotels but this stay was by far the best we stayed to celebrate my year old daughter s birthday and the staff really went out of their way to make her birthday a special one especially the hostess samantha i am so glad that we chose to stay at the crowne plaza for this celebration and just when we thought that it couldn t get any better we then sat down to enjoy the buffet style breakfast bottom line you will not regret choosing to stay at this hotel we will definitely be returning
