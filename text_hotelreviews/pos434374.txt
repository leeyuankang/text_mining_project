re cashier your hotel receptionist was amazing she was very competent in her role extremely helpful and very approachable we have stayed at this hotel a few times and she is definitely the best first interaction we have had i wish i could remember her name but hopefully the cashier number helps as she deserves a special congratulations all the staff were great but she was exceptional she made our anniversary even more special
