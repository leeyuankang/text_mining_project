my room was a non smoking room but stank of cigarette smoke when i walked in the previous guest had been smoking out the window as there had been several cigarette butts stubbed on the window ledge the hotel did manage this extremely well and moved me to a new room with an upgrade well done to them for turning a poor experience into a good one
