i loved the room two spacious double beds in one room came very handy as we were friends travelling with child each the room had everything we needed and aircon was very good pool is not very big but nice lovely breakfast too i loved the fact that this hotel is not too far from london attractions and transport yet still in a quiet and modern area customer service was excellent throughout
