this hotel was perfect for us we could walk to many sites and museums and the tube stop was right around the corner if we didn t walk it s a minute walk to euston station or king s cross the hotel is very elegant with a beautiful lobby our room was really comfortable and quiet the bathroom was good sized we had a mini fridge and a tea kettle so we could have tea in our room the wifi was good really everything we needed to be comfortable was provided and we were in a great location we loved it and would definitely stay here next time we re in london
