omg the beds were so comfortable and felt so fresh and clean the black out curtains make for an excellent nights sleep and didn t hear any other guests moving around amazing nights sleep wine glasses in room and small fridge plus bottles of water which came in very handy the facilities were lovely they provided you with towels to use in the pool great for the cable car across the river right into the car park no hassle only took a jacket as weather forecast said no rain but it tipped down lucky they had a spare umbrella borrowed for the evening
