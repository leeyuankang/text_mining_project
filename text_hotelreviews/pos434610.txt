perfect location for the our room was large and had a fantastic view over the thames the complementary mini bar was a lovely surprise and we loved the availability of ice on each floor our room was missing an extra towel and robe which i had to ask housekeeping for as she was servicing another room she was very helpful check in out was a breeze loved the late checkout of the hot tub in spa area was great hot and powerful breakfast was epic the choice was good but the clincher for my wife and me was that it was lovely and hot and eggs made fresh to your preference excellent value for money sadly lacking in the spa area
