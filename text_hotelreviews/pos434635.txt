lovely hotel the room had everything and more the buffet breakfast was excellent and there was lots of choice and the staff were helpful the only slight problem i encountered was that i asked for a very quiet room and the room they gave me was next to the lift as people early in he morning queued for the lift i was woken up other than that the stay was very comfortable and i would return
