i loved everything it was a lovely trip with everything i needed in the room it was my birthday and my partner rang up to say it was my birthday and if anything could be added and the staff had put balloons and a selection of chocolate in the room free of charge this was a lovely touch what made me feel really welcome and the view was wonderful
