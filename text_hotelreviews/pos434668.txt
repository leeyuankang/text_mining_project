hotel staff were extremely pleasant on reception offered a choice of rooms on arrival either with a bath or shower room was extremely clean with all facilities very nice touches like pillow spray and a chocolate each the only reason i didn t rate as excellent on comfort were the pillows were so firm overall brilliant location would definately stay again we were in the quiet zone which was perfect overlooking the river
