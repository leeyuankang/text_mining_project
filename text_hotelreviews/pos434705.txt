the staff were excellent and very friendly the room was amazing and very clean the breakfast buffet had everything you could imagine the hotel was very well placed for the and right on the dlr so we didn t have to worry about navigating through residential areas the staff were also very knowledgeable about the area and gave us advice for meals and how to get to places the car parking was right next door to the hotel and very reasonable to say you were parking in central london
