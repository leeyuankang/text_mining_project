basically i liked more or less everything and it is very hard to identify any real faults ordered room service which was uber quick good pool and facilities and very attendant and friendly staff that made for a very good two night stay very close to the dlr so travelling easy one change min journey to embankment is not an issue stayed at other hotels in the same area but will choose this hotel in the future ps twin double bed rooms are lush
