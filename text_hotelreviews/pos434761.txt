the location was excellent very close to the dlr although the hotel was very busy it was very quiet in the rooms and the area was very quiet the staff were excellent and the food was very nice although i did ask for a room with a view we didn t actually have that but i would definitely stay in crowne plaza docklands again if i was staying in london
