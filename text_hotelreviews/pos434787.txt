we are a tall couple and like plenty of room in the bed so always opt for twin beds these are excellent comfy and roomy just as we like for a good nights sleep when working all day at excel excellent location for exhibition hall and equally good for city attractions by taxi organised from hotel foyer when required safe parking on site worth the minimal charge room view nothing special but at least we could see our car down in the hotel carpark at rear excellent food friendly staff pleasing bar and restaurant star
