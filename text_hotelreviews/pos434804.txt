stayed at the crowne plaza for a few nights what a beautiful hotel receptionists and other staff were very helpful and friendly our room was on the floor very clean modern and comfortable and a very good sized room room service food was very nice and the overall look of the hotel is quite fancy there s also the option of a spa swimming pool and jacuzzi although we didn t have the time to make use of those facilities for my partner and i the location of the hotel was great away from all of the hustle and bustle but not too quiet it was just right with plenty of eating options in the would definitely recommend this hotel to others and book here again
