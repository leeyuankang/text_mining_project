everything the staff were great when we arrived we only had one robe the maid was outside our room and we asked if we could possibly have another one and she brought it within minutes our room was clean and the extra pillows were appreciated the leisure facilities were really good and we made good use of the jacuzzi and steam room all in all this was our stay here and we are already planning when we can do this again
