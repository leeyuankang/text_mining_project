the staff were friendly approachable and nothing was too much trouble rooms kept clean and tidy although i had to ask for supplies regularly ie tea coffee but they always brought them to to the room sam the hostess for the restaurant in the morning was amazing so friendly and full of life the facilities were good although the times for swimming were restricted my son was a week off and we couldn t swim after which was an issue for example when you are out all day and return to your hotel you like to relax and a swim etc ends the day would have appreciated a view of the river cable cars for the price
