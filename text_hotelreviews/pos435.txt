we had gluten free breakfast they had separate toaster for gluten free breads but i can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet otherwise i can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast i just could not eat it still for sure i could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast enough for a big man it was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel
