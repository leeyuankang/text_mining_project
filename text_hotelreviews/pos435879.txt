location is excellent the staff are super helpful and if you have any problems with the room they will do whatever they can to make it right we celebrated our tenth anniversary and we are glad we stayed here because the hotel made us feel very special the staff are always friendly and gave good recommendations for romantic evening strolls the room does get warm but it s quite nice when you have been out in the cold and you can always turn the radiator down there is also an excellent vegan restaurant two minutes away you are close to supermarkets too should we come back to vienna we would return to this hotel
