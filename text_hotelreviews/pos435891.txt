the bed was the best part of this stay i liked the overall feel of cleanliness and clean lines of the room i felt like i was in hong kong actually or some other upscale hotel with wooden walls and lots of glass but any sense you were staying in an old building in vienna was lost with these upgrades quite sad really since vienna is such a classic city basically if you need a room in vienna and don t care about ambience this hotel has great beds and rooms at the back are quiet unusual in a busy city you will hear st stephens bells ring also the window opens wide which is great when everyone else is convinced they re freezing but you re overheated plus the staff does not automatically have the heat on which is also an excellent choice let your guests decide how warm they want to be save money and energy the last hotel i stayed at the astoria wien felt like entering the gates of hell itself they had the heat cranked up when i first entered the room completely unnecessary and that has to be expensive for them
