lovely quiet hotel good location staff tried very hard to ensure i had a comfortable stay although i wish the receptionists had been a little more friendly the breakfast was good although limited for vegetarians my waitress was lovely and always served my coffee promptly and housekeeping was excellent would happily stay again recommended
