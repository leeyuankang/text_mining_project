the bed was my favourite part about my stay it was super comfy and i haven t had such restful sleep in months my partner really appreciated it too he had a broken hand so the comfort helped him deal with the pain and enjoy his holiday more i also loved the building itself the lobby is beautiful we had a room with a little balcony facing inside to the lobby and it was actually nearly nicer than if we had one facing outside the atrium is spectacular
