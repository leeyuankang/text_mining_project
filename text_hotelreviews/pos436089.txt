the hotel in the heart of the city minutes away from all the main attraction points of the city it is located a couple of minutes away from the red light district the hotel comes with an enclosed parking lot that is extremely secured the staff is extremely welcoming and helpful we even had a small issue with our credit card payment and the receptionist in charge was super patient and professional and helped us solved the situation the interior of the hotel is absolutely beautiful the rooms are big and spacious and really nicely decorated in a typical dutch manner needless to say the rooms look exactly like in the pictures if not better the bed is pretty big and extremely comfortable the room came with bath robes slipper and toiletries we even had a coffee machine and tea aside from the minibar it was an amazing experience that was worth every penny spent and i would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for accommodation in amsterdam
