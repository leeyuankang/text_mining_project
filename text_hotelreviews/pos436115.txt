the room was lovely exactly what we wanted the bed was extremely comfortable which mattered to us as we had busy days planned and needed a good rest overnight ready for the following days activities it was in a good location close enough to get everywhere on foot but far away enough to not hear the hustle bustle in the early hours the concierge service was a nice foc extra as we had a late flight but still wanted to venture around the city the hotel held our cases at no extra cost so we didn t have to lug them about with us
