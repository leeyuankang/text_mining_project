the room service staff in particular were very accommodating when we had smalll special requests the hotel is more appropriate for business than it is for leisure having said that my family and i were comfortable and enjoyed our stay while this property is more expensive and is probably on the mark on value for money but it is a very nice place to stay in amsterdam
