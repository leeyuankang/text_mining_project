we upgraded ourselves to a business class room just before our trip which was beautiful and worth the money it had an amazing view of one of the canals bed was really comfortable lots of space in the room for all of your belongings as well as to move around the staff were really helpful and welcoming considering we arrived early hours of the morning location was great only minutes walk from the main attractions thoroughly enjoyed our stay would definitely return
