the location is fantastic as you can easily walk everywhere in the central part of amsterdam but is a little more quiet than the absolute centre we went out for breakfast both days and found a super local cafe comfortable bed lovely linen excellent bathroom with good lighting although not the most powerful shower great being able to park on site expensive but this is standard in amsterdam
