the first time we stayed here after i proposed to my wife and she absolutely loved the place this time we returned and will definitely do so again in the future l hotel is the best hotel in paris if you like luxurious but small boutique hotels and personal service it has a very cosy bar area with a good selection of special cocktails for a nice aperitif and the restaurant setting is beautiful we did not have dinner here however only breakfast which i highly recommend don t forget to reserve the complimentary hour private hamam very nice to do when you arrive at the hotel or just before after dinner one of the best hotels i ve stayed in and we will definitely return
