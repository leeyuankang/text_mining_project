the location was absolutely perfect had a comfortable feel to the place everything was perfect apart from the things i didn t like which i will state these the cleaners always left cute little things in your room like turning the towels into boats and folding things up for you without entering to much of your privacy the staff were very friendly and lovely people just had an amazing feel to the place me and my partner enjoyed it muchly
