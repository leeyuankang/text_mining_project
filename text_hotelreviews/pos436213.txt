central but quiet location excellent for exploring the city center on foot bed comfortable room quiet and spotless good breakfast buffet in room nespresso machine what more to ask for i was able to check in much earlier than expected an added bonus after an early morning flight hotel restaurant serves decent food but ambiance is rather forgettable
