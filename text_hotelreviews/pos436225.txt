this was a great hotel with really amiable staff ready to help whenver you had a question even hiding a secret present i had bought for my aunt and uncle while we walked around so that i could surprise them later at the coffee table when we came back for a break the location is fantastic close to everything in the old center right by a canal so you immediately get the perfect amsterdam view i travel at least once a month whether for work or leisure combined and i must say that i have nothing bad to say about this hotel clean rooms with coffee and tea in the room for you comfortable beds nice helpful staff with a perfect location and the breakfast is an array of incredible delicious choice so if you have the option to get breakfast included don t hesitate for a moment you won t find better and it s way too expensive to spend one off and it should be noted that they have parking conveniently located at the hotel to avoid running around amsterdam and risking fines
