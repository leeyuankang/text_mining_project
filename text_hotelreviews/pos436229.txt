the location is great you can walk for few minutes to the city center and many attractions like bernand museum anne frank house dam square and many more the staff are friendly speaking good english best staff are the ladies at the breakfast restaurant who are always smiling and helpful thank you to all of them big thanks to sherly she is always running around to help the guests with lovely smile the breakfast is great the rooms are very clean and we loved the espresso machine provided in the room i was worried that the hotel was close to the red district when we checked the map as we were with our kids but we didn t notice that during our stay when we walked around so no need to worry about this issue we booked an airport taxi online but then we found out that the taxi provided by the hotel is a bit cheaper milan at the reception was very helpful we requested a canal view for our inter connecting rooms which was not available in our first day of arrival but he managed to move us to other rooms with canal view next day we left in the morning keeping our luggages at the old room and we found them at the new room when we returned to the hotel at the evening if you travel with kids inter connecting rooms is the best choice you can send a request to the hotel to get this confirmed after you make the booking we really enjoyed our one week vacation
