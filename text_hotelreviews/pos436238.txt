the beds were very comfortable and the room a good size the coffee machine was great the bath and shower were good everything in all areas was very clean the gym and sauna was a real treat breakfast was amazing but you had to be really hungry to make the most of the variety and quantity available we had one evening meal which was scrumptious staff on reception were very helpful
