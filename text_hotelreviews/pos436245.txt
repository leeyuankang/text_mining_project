the location is excellent if not the best situated in a calm street next to damn square min walk and other main squares and very close to the red light district however it is perfect for a family stay and if you don t want to notice the district you just don t the staff were very friendly and helpful in all means we booked the buisness room and it was spacious with lovely decorations but with no view view to the facing buildings it also included beds although we were only two they provide tour booking services as well as reasonably priced taxi services the enterance of the hotel is lovely a typical radisson blu enterance
