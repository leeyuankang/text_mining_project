breakfast was amazing well worth paying extra for location was excellent within walking distance of all the main sights just outside the buzzing red light district on a nice quiet street room was immaculate and the bed was super comfy couldnt fault it at all even the building itself was stunning inside i loved amsterdam and i will definitely return and stay in the radisson blu again
