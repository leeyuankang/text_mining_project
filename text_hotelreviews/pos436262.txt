the bed were terribly uncomfortable we changed our room from superior to junior suite in a hope we will get a more comfortable bed but the bed was the same cheap quality we could not get good night sleep you can t unpack in the superior room the closet is cm inches narrow i guess the people who designed and who approved that design are used to throwing their stuff on the floor and keeping it there the design of the superior room looks like the designer just got out of the kindergarten in love with primary colors we stayed in the hotel last year and loved it that s why we came back but it turned out that back in january the hotel underwent a renovation it was obviously done on a cheap and the main casualty was the bed comfort
