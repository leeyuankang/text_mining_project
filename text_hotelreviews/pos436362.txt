the bed was really comfortable and you can choose from five different types of pillows the staff is very helpful and thoughtful we went out of the hotel and came back to borrow an umbrella and the staff already guessed that and prepared an umbrella for us the location is very convenient and you can walk to most major attraction in the old city center the room is tastefully decorated new and clean i would definitely come back to this hotel if i go to amsterdam again
