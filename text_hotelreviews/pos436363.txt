it was my stay in this hotel this time it was not planned but was rather an exceptional stop over on the way to brussels due to the sad event in the brussels airport we spend a night in amstersdam as always welcomed by very helpful staff got an early check in and even upgraded to business class for free the location is perfect a quiet gem in the centre of amsterdam
