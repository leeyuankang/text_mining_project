the location is great the breakfast was wonderful and the staff more than helpful we asked for a parking place and we could leave the car there during two days even if we stayed one night we checked in at am instead of pm with no problem the room was ready nice furnished and decorated room with a nespresso bright and clean the lobby was renovated
