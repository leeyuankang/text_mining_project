we arrived in amsterdam at knowing that we couldn t check in until we decided to leave our bags with the concierge we were then told to come back in an hour there should be a room ready we arrived back hours later to be told there was still no room ready but they would upgrade us to a superior room which was ready to save us waiting any longer this was very much appreciated as we were both exhausted from travelling
