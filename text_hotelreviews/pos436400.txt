our room was fantastic very large for amsterdam we had the breakfast included booking but had to leave early the lovely lady on duty at the breakfast room boxed us up some juice yoghurt and allowed me to grab some pastries the lobby has recently been renovated and is gorgeous worth a look even if you don t get to stay
