very welcoming and pleasant staff we told the staff member at check in that we were there on our honeymoon and we had a little congratulations card and champagne waiting for us when we popped back to the hotel later that day very quiet hotel just far enough away from noisy streets but we were only ever about a min walk away from the hotel very satisfied with our stay here
