stayed here for nights in the beginning of january hotel was undergoing renovations in the building in front and therefore was offering attractive price we called to ask for an early check in and were told that we should inquire on arrival early check in was impossible since both days we were there many people arrive early and wait for their check in the only option to check in early was to pay for a room upgrade we left our bags with the bell desk and walked around returning back at we checked in at location is excellent its in the center of the town but a street or two away from the crowds we took a cab from the central train station as we had a bit too much luggage for a minute walk room was clean nicely furnished nice bathroom comfortable mattress large bed consisted of twin beds put together
