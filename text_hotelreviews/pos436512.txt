well located in a small quiet street within easy walking distance of some lovely cafes and bars coffee shops within a stones throw of the hotel no pun intended we found it a little too easy to stumble into the nearby red light district at first but once you get your bearings it s fine well equipped rooms with everything we needed and as always the personal pillow menu
