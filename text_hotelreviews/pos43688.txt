the hotel was clean and the check in and check out went smoothly without issues the staff spoke both french and english so language was no issue breakfast was a mix of continental and english breakfast with a varying selection of cheese and fruits so everyone with a normal diet should find something for them selection was also wide enough to cater the needs of a vegetarian the area was full of different style restaurants so one can easily go out for a different style for a week a large grocery shop was also located two blocks away
