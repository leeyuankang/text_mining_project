i had wanted to stay here ever since i saw the exterior two years ago the internet price came down just before my august trip so i grabbed it the hotel did not disappoint it was better than i had hoped the room staff were efficient and sweet the desk staff helpful the door staff adequate not very friendly actually the bar excellent i didn t try the restaurant the room was well appointed and i loved the kettle and the provided tea sugar shortbread the shower directions were hilariously confusing but i got the thing to work just fine excellent i will hope to stay there again
