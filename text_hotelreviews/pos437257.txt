gustavo at the reception gave me a very beautiful room with a nice view and he was so kind and helpful i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will recommend it to my friends as well this hotel is not located in the heart of the city but there are lots of public transportation systems near the property like metro and bus which you can use to reach every district you want
