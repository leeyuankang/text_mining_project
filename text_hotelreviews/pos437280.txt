i liked the area the distance from the metro to the hotel and the distance to the nou camp the restaurants in the immediate area are ok starbucks was a real help lol the hotel itself is lovely nice reception nice little restaurant and the staff were very helpful the room had a lovely interior overall this hotel is in a business university area which has a friendly safe feel to it it s perfect for a trip to the see barcelona play or the atp barcelona tennis tournament with the metro only mins walk away you can easily access all the major areas or attractions within barcelona this hotel is now my hotel for whenever we visit the great city of barcelona p s messi is the greatest
