everything was great the staff were so helpful they did everything possible to make our stay a wonderful experience the location of the hotel is fantastic minutes walk from the metro and so close to the camp nou which was brilliant i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to barcelona a bit outside the city centre but with the metro so close and so easy to use it s not a problem the room was beautiful so clean and it had everything we needed thank you to the staff for making our first trip to barcelona a memorable one
