this is a fantastic hotel it doesn t look much from the outside but inside its a very clean and modern hotel the pool is small but rarely too busy so it s nice to hop in there at the end of a long days sightseeing the rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is good location wise it s a little out of the centre but les corts metro stop is only a minute walk and from there you can get pretty much anywhere in the city with ease highly recommended
