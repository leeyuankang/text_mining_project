excellent proximity to gare de lyon and paris sights in the bastille area room and bathroom were modern and very clean nice towels air conditioning worked well room was very quiet outdoor courtyard perfect for an evening picnic and glass of wine staff was incredibly friendly and helpful even helped us check in early at after our long flight from california would definitely stay here again should i find myself needing a hotel near the bastille gare de lyon
