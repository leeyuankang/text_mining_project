the hotel was beautiful very clean and comfortable the staff were more than helpful and cyril was absolutely great what a personality he has and no matter how busy he was he always made us feel special all staff gave us information needed to make our stay just about perfect the breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of choices this hotel is nice and central near a metro yet far enough away from the centre of paris to be quiet and retain its frenchness
