the staff were wonderfully friendly considerate and accommodating which makes a big impression when traveling w a small child great beds nice that they had the pullout bed set up for our daughter stocked kitchen was great we were able to prepare meals for our little one and have access to her snacks the layout of the suite was efficient and well planned out separate tvs in bedroom and living area meant we could relax and our daughter could watch her cartoons the elevators were in great condition and had more room than what we were accustomed to in bcn but for slight snafu w the painting in the hallway the next am it was an ideal stay
