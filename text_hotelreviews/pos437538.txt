this is a hidden gem everything about hotel neri was exceptional i am very pick when it comes to hotels but there was not a single negative aspect here from the start the front desk was so nice and warming it is a little trick to get to the hotel since it is hidden behind the cathedral in a pedestrian street but daniel waited for us and helped us with all our bags the building is a dream impeccable in every detail the rooms so clean quiet cozy and comfortable the decoration amazing and the location oh my god we were right in the middle of everything within seconds of walking safe neighborhoods great places to eat including the hotel the breakfast was delicious great for shopping and within minutes of the famous places to visit transportation available super easy we really felt sad to leave
