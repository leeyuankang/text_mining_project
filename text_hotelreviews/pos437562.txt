myself and my partner traveled as a couple for a romantic break at the end of january and what can i say our exceptions where definitely surpassed extreme elegance with a modern twist exceptional attention to small details from the hotel scent the candlelight reception to the surfacing on the elevators made every aspect of this small hotel endearing and charming the staff were very welcoming accommodating and friendly they even provided is with an ipad and phone chargers for some work we had to do the balcony in our room overlooked the placa sant felip neri and each evening we had the pleasure of hearing local acoustic musicians playing through our balcony doors the roof top terrace was also a favourite of ours with a perfect location in the heart of the gothic quarter we would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to barcelona we are already planning our next visit
