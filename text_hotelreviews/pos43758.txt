i was pleased that my room faced the quiet interior courtyard it seems the hotel has been recently refurbished everything is nice and fresh i appreciated the good wifi the luggage storage and the friendly accessible staff an added plus there was no noise in the morning no vacuum in the hallway no slamming service doors i really got to sleep in
