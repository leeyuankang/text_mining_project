very clean and new feeling we had family apartment which had two rooms which included small table mini frig etc bathroom was very nice with an awesome shower and plenty of counter space for four people staff was helpful and friendly we walked everywhere from this hotel but just because we were willing and not because things were necessarily close the location was safe and quiet
