just loved this hotel bright and cheerful with great air con which was a relief as it was degrees outside our room was decorated to a high standard and surrounded along two walls with windows that all opened and full length curtains there was a sofa kitchen area with tea coffee and a kettle sink a fridge freezer and a lovely bathroom in the shower there were dispensers on the wall with rum body wash peppermint shampoo and peppermint conditioner and everything was spotless the breakfast was great loads of choice including bacon beans sausages tomatoes the hotel was so safe you had to access it with your room card and the lifts also would only operate with your room card
