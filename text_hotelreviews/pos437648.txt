we chose capri by fraser based on the reviews i am so happy we stayed here for our day trip to barcelona the staff was awesome our first night there we ate at the hotel and my girls and years old where tired and cranky the manager came up and was playing with them and even brought them a little stuffed lamb which is the capri mascot it was such a relief for my husband and i we had been up since and where tired and cranky too lol the staff also arranged an airport shuttle for us when we arrived to the airport the driver was holding a sign with my name on it and i felt like a rock star he even had a car seat for my little one this is a quite location and away from the city life of barcelona it was a nice minute walk to the beach and there is lots of public transportation near by we did take the metro and taxis everyday so we could see the sights but that s because we have two kids if it was just my husband and i we would ve been able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see it is only a few blocks for la sagrada familia i would highly recommend capri by fraser and their airport shuttle service to everyone we plan on coming back soon
