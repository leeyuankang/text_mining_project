the best time to realise that you didn t bring your uk plug adapter is when you find a uk power socket in your room all in all i wouldn t mind booking this again the reception were helpful and the room was as clean as one could reasonably expect it wasn t far from the marina underground station with a direct link to the more interesting parts of the city it is within walking distance to arc de triomf and parc de la ciutadella the breakfast buffet english and continental had more than enough variety for the time we stayed there
