capri by fraser is modern and very tastefully decorated the location is good close to the metro but the beach is not exactly close by if you are walking the studio was impeccable have never seen such high quality toiletries by the way and the staff extremely friendly the breakfast overpriced in my view but the variety of options compensated for the fee i m very happy we stayed there barcelona is gorgeous would return in the future if given the opportunity
