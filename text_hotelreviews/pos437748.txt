amazing value for money much better than a standard hotel you get a kitchenette and a living space with a tv on a stand that rotates to face either the sofa or the bed en suite bathroom no bath but walk in shower was enough space for a couple to leave all their toiletries the room included plenty of space for storage as well as an iron and safe everything was clean beds were comfortable and all electricals worked as expected for the two nights we stayed there it felt like we had a small studio apartment to ourselves rather than a hotel room which definitely improves the experience
