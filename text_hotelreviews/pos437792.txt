the location is good min walk stops from pl cataluniya minuts walk to the lovely ciutadela parc the rooms are clean and big and well equipped too many pillows and chairs for my opinion the kitchenette has a full equipment nothing is missing we didn t take a breakfast so i don t know if it worth the price very expencive but min walk from the hotel towards the metro there is a nice place to eat and also there is a small grocery store near the metro stop
