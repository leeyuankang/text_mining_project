there is absolutely nothing to complain about we simply loved the spacious room we stayed in it was clean tidy and very comfortable having a small kitchen with all the necessary utensils was also a great advantage the bed was a bit rough to our taste though but all in all we slept well those long pillows are heaven on earth the bathroom was also very spacious and great to use there is even a clothesline in the wall if you ever need to dry your clothes a pleasant bonus was l occitane cosmetics in the bathroom the staff was helpful and friendly with excellent command of english so we had no problem with communication and we greatly enjoyed breakfasts there were lots of various foods meat fish eggs vegs and fruits to choose from great coffee and pastry too so ordering breakfasts there is highly recommended the location is great close to marina metro station and close enough to all the sights if you enjoy walking wifi signal was excellent we would definitely choose this hotel again
