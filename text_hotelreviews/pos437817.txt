the deluxe room very comfortable with a large bed and the room was cleaned every day hotel staff very helpful the rambla del problenou was only to stroll away and there were enough bars and restaurants to suit all ages and pallets would recommend this hotel away from the crowds but close enough to all the sites of the city for an enjoyable city break
