the facilities are modern and clean the staff was very helpful with directions to and about public transit and information about the city on my first day in the hotel the internet worked only very sporadically and i was ready to give the hotel a poor rating for that alone since i needed internet access for the business i was doing in barcelona however i mentioned the problem to a staff member at the front desk he rebooted the wi fi router and i had excellent internet access for the rest of my stay so i now give the hotel an excellent rating the staff speaks fairly good english certainly good enough for anything you may need to know
