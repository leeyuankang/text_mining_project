the staff were all very pleasant and helpful nothing seemed to be too much trouble even when i locked myself out of the safe box in the bedroom it wasn t any trouble for the receptionist to come up with me to resolve the problem celine was very helpful with the maps and with ensuring we knew where we were going great directions one of your other receptionists was very helpful with an enquiry about the canal openings unfortunately our stay was just too early for that trip we will have to come again the water was always hot and in good supply
