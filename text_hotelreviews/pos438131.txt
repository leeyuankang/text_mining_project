this was the most beautiful hotel we ve ever stayed at the pictures on booking com and the hotel s website do not do it justice it has to be seen to be believed we were checked in very quickly which is great when you ve travelled all day the staff at reception gave us a map and recommended where to go in the city our room was a superior double and met all of our needs we didn t avail of many of the hotel s facilities as we spent our time exploring the city however we did come back to the rooftop bar a few nights to grab a drink the food and drinks are very very reasonably priced for such a gorgeous setting we were grateful for the always working air con in our room and to have had our fridge restocked with water and juice each day it was the perfect spot to stay to enjoy the city central a second walk to the rambla minutes from the boquer a market but also hidden away from the busy main street meaning you get a great nights sleep i look forward to revisiting
