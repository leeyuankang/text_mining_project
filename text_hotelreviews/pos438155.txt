the good thing about the hotel for those to whom swimming matters is the small but adequte pool on the roof this is useable to betweeen june and august for young travelers there s a sunning area and a bar open til about in the morning other than that it s a poorly designed boutique hotel the view out the window was of barcelona families getting cool on their balconies about six feet away both nights somebody maybe a resident or residents set out to bark and howl to get resident dogs across the street to do the same at which they were very successful we suspect that the local families poor are not thrilled that a hotel for rich foreigners has a nightclub functioning on the roof until all hours of the morning and take their revenge other design details of hotel the shower door only opens enough for a body to squeeze through the air conditioning wasn t effective at cooling in june heat and because of the closeness of the local neighbors we couldn t keep the one window open at night most rooms on an inside courtyard are under a glass roof so have no air circulation a few are not under the roof and might be more private and airier the boutique design is all sharp corners on beds and furniture great for bumping shins although a queen bed would have been adequate for two people ours was a king which let almost no space in the very small room no desk only one chair the decor gray walls mixed with gold panels combines gaudy with dreary in a way we ve never before seen there were a few old tiles in the floor and nice iron work along stairways indicating that this was a lovely building before it was improved this is a tremendously overpriced hotel per night for what it offers my recommendation is to choose a hotel a little bit out of the ramblas barrio g tico neighborhood in a less crowded and more fairly priced area
