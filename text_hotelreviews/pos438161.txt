hotel and rooms are exactly as pictured as mentioned by other reviews the toilet door seems to make you feel claustrophobic if closed while you re using the porcelain throne our first day we graced some noodles from down the street and sat on the balcony watching the world go by the hotel while renovated and modern pays homage to its past with tiles and reliefs filling the hallways and staircases i especially loved the mermaid room where breakfast is served we made use of the rooftop pool had a drink at the bar and at all times staff were professional friendly and courteous
