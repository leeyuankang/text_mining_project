location of the hotel is great if you are looking to be in the centre of the hustle and bustle of the city it is located on a side road just off la rambla so it is not so noisy plaza catalunya is only a min walk where you can catch the airport shuttle and the hop on hop off tour buses a min walk in the other direction brings you to the habour the hotel itself is very stylishly decorated and they even provide a common computer and printer in the lobby if you need to print documents the room we had was also nicely designed with light switches located on the bedside stands for easy access the beds were also very comfortable
