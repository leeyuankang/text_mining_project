the hotel was in a perfect central location off the ramblas easy access to attractions metro taxis couldn t be more perfect for a first time visit to barcelona or if you are a regular visitor like me i will definitely go back to this hotel the staff were very friendly and attentive very comfy bed and pillows i did not have breakfast as it is so near to all sorts of eateries dinner looked fabulous again i did not eat there the bar was cozy tastefully restored and designed i liked the design of the room it was impeccably clean quiet room free minibar items water and juice was a nice touch the hotel public areas are beautiful a great mix of ancient and modern design great shower nice glass doors inside the bathroom great design
