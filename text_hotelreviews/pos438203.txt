the staff were amazing very friendly valentino welcomed us when we first checked in and gave us a map with the best restaurants to visit the hotel was in a perfect location right on the ramblas which offered a range of restaurants bars and shops with the metro station only mins walk i was hesitant at first after reading reviews about the noise and problems with sleeping so i requested a room further away from the reception the hotel were very accommodating and gave me a room on the floor where i had a perfect sleep no problems with noise from other rooms or the bar located downstairs this hotel is exactly like the photos and just as beautiful in real life it s defiantly luxury for half the price the terrace bar wasn t open when we went but the bar inside had a good vibe not too loud and busy but perfect for a evening drink after dinner
