the style and design of the hotel was lovely it was a beautiful building a really modern state of the art hotel that mixed the historic features in with the new perfectly great size of room and there was a lot of detail put in to each feature we had a room with a balcony which we weren t expecting which we liked the staff were really helpful and polite and there was a great bar and restaurant downstairs close to everything and right next to a metro station really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend
