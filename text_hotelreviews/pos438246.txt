the design and architecture was breathtaking the cocktail terrace bar is worth a visit recommend raspberry mojito the meal in the restaurant was of a very high standard and the chef sent out little taster dishes which was a lovely treat recommend the turbot dish will definitely be recommending this hotel to family friends etc
