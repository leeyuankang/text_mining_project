the hotel is a hidden gem just off la ramblas as soon as you walk in you are surrounded by luxury it is not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for and i would definitely stay here again the hotel the staff the service and the food at the fonda restaurant and on the roof top terrace are exceptional
