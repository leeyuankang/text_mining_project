a lovely quirky hotel the reception staff where very knowledgeable a most courteous welcome perfect location for la rambla close enough to walk explore and shop but quiet enough to miss the all noise as the hotel is situated in a side street with traffic restrictions we would highly recommend this hotel for a city visit to barcelona
