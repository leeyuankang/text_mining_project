we have stayed nights in this hotel really good location good price the service is very good people are helpful and willing to give us advice the room is modern and space is big enough comparing to other european hotels we had welcome drinks for free on the beautiful terrace where has a swimming pool it is a place which is quiet in a noisy neighborhood the rambla is crowed and full of people highly recommend the hotel
