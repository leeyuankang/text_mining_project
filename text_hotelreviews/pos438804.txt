the room is very comfortable very clean the breakfast is fabulous the swimming pool very clean the location is very nice despite the fact that it s far away from the city center there is a bus stop in meters from the hotel that drives you downtown in minutes or you can walk around minutes through a beautiful park and get the metro ms amaia helped us a lot and assisted us immediately with our payments emails that needed to be printed etc the food at the restaurant was really very nice very nice sangria and cocktails
