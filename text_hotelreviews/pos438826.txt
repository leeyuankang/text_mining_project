the staff they were all very friendly and helpful great view of the city from the balcony near to buses out of the city which is my preference less noise and less pollution near to a nice park which leads down to diagonal the main route through barcelona also a nice walk down to nou camp for football aficionados there is a great catalan restaurant less than metres up the hill in front of hotel
