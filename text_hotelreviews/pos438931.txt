we stayed in barcelona for four nights in a different hotel over christmas then we went to valencia for nights and for new years i booked this place it was terrible absolutely terrible far away from everything the room was smaller than any other room we ve ever stayed in our window was overlooking a wall it s just a dreadful place absolutely not worth the price they charge the hotel we stayed in in barcelona before we went to valencia was a hundred times better i truly regretted booking this place
