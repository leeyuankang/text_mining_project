the hotel had just opened and there were a few issues we were checked into someone elses room by error and walked in on their privacy as well the spa was not opened yet mini bar was less than satisfactory however our room was lovely and the bathroom was beautiful the staff was extremely helpful and very friendly and accommodating i would try this hotel again
