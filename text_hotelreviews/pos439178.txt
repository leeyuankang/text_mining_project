this hotel was great the staff were very helpful and friendly the location for the royal albert hall was a minutes walk with loads of shops and restaurants added bonus was the underground car parking and was amazed that we booked a club room cheaper than other hotels and we got complementary drinks and a great breakfast in the executive lounge would go back to this hotel again and certainly highly recommend this hotel
