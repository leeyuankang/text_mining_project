the check in was very quick and efficient despite a long qu it is so central within walking distance the hotel is very clean and reasonably priced for the heart of london staff were polite and helpful i would recommend hotel for anyone planning a shopping trip or trip to the museuns or parks or the albert hall as you can walk there and back easily
