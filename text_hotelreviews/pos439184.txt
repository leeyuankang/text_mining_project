room was first class spacious and very clean good quality bathroom and appreciate the bottle of water in hotel room when we arrived and the tea coffee making facilities the price of room for the night was excellent within our budget one downside we had to wait until unless we paid extra to go into our room to unpack freshen up and go out on a site seeing tour but everything else was good
