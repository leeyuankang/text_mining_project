in general we were satisfied with accommodation and facilities however a stairway alternative to the lifts was confusing to say the least and i would recommend addressing this problem the handle for the toilet cistern was not good even when it worked it would be impossible for someone with arthritis to operate the handle did infact break on our morning of departure finally i was disappointed in the breakfast cold food and cold plates
