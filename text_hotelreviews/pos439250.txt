what i like the least was that your it helpdesk from the hotel person was unbelievably rude with me and the wifi didn t work until the last day that apparently you changed without advising the guest i had to call numerous times to reception to sort out this problem also if it wasn t for the upgrade of twin room you gave me out of my discomfort in the normal twin you offer it would have been a nightmare like the film the shining movie long corridors min to the lifts and also the air conditioning system is almost victorian there was bad smell and noise as i said the upgrade of a superior twin room on the fifth floor saved our stay from misery the hotel overall need renovation urgently some members of staff were nice but the receptionist were so serious and out of charm absolutely unpleasant
