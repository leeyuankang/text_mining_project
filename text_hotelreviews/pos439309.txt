we booked the copthorne tara hotel as we were attending a jolly merse concert the royal albert hall so this was the perfect location for us the hotel is great for access anywhere in around london the staff were very pleasant friendly happy to help the superior room we had was very comfortable even had air conditioning we paid a bit extra for breakfast but my word you would not be disappointed as the choice was quite unbelievable from continental english pancakes chinese if you wanted breads toast juices as much tea coffee as you wanted the bar is open till late the bar staff are brilliant really know how to pour the perfect pint of guinness so if you are looking for somewhere to stay when in london i can strongly recommend the copthorne tara hotel
