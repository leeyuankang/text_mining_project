the kids felt so special at arrival and throughout our stay and that was the most important thing to me as it was their vacation the staff was super helpful and friendly we got free breakfast all three days and our single beds were put together to a kingsize bed with extra pillows so we didnt need a spare bed for the the youngest one location was perfect just a short walk from the underground the museums we were going to and diana memorial playground and much more being so central in london you could think there would be much noise from the city but it was actually very peaceful and quiet this was our second stay here and we will certainly come back again
