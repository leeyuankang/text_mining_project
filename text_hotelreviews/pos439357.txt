i was really worried about taking the car into london and where to park when we arrived at copthorne tara hotel in the early evening it was a breeze drove straight into their well lit basement car park and found several available spaces a stairwell is available from the car park to the reception we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff our club room was on the floor very clean and comfortable bed as we could access the club lounge we managed to avoid the long queue at breakfast and be in a more quiet setting lovely breakfast with lots of choice and very attentive staff the location of this hotel is within easy walking distance to museums and the royal albert hall would definitely book again
