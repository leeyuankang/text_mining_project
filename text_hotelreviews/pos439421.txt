the hotel is situated in an ideal location only a minute walk from the nearest tube the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and checked our luggage in whilst we went to the theatre the room was nice and warm and the beds very comfy the bathroom was nice and clean the breakfast buffet was great value for money we would definitely use this hotel again
