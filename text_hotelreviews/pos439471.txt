good location just around the corner from subway stations all the shops on kensington high street close by and could walk to the palace which was also nearby loved the chair in the room handy to have a fridge in the room and was able to cool things down quicker as there was a tiny freezer in the fridge i was pleased that there was also a bath and not just a shower room was well lit as i have found some of the other millennium hotels the rooms have been really dark
