the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the location cannot be beat i loved being in the just steps from jardin du luxembourg and a few blocks from saint germain s restaurants and flavor i walked easily to the banks of the seine to notre same and saint chapelle and was always met with a friendly greeting going in or out as a solo traveller it put me at ease to be staying in a hotel with such attentive service
