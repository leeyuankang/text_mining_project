the hotel is in an excellent location very convenient to the metro or to walk to other areas we loved feeling centrally located yet still away from some of the more touristy areas the staff was courteous and very helpful with directions or questions the bed was comfortable enough and the rooms were very clean the ac did work though perhaps could have been stronger
