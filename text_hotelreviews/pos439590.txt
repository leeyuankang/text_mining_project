i have a disability and felt all members of staff went out of their way to ensure the service we received was exceptional ensuring we had a disabled room and the room was near an elevator we only made the booking a few days in advance they also ensured we had a disabled space at the front of the hotel for my car i would like to thank all the staff but a special extra thanks goes to the reception team for making the experience most enjoyable
