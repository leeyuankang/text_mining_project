the bed was small but still comfy air con in the room was good and the room nice and quiet car park is a bit cramped but by london prices is a bargain outside the congestion zone too reception and cafe restaurants were also good breakfast really is great too a big thing for me and i ve had a lot of hotel breakfasts reception staff very helpful and friendly
