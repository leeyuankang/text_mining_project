this hotel is brilliantly located in a little backwater just off kensington high street only a short walk from the local tube station central line the bright lights of london s west end are minutes away the room was fine and the bed very comfortable firm and flat if you know what i mean room service was good and the menu reasonably priced while there was a good atmosphere in the bar and satisfying choice in the restaurants downstairs the staff were friendly and welcoming especially at the front desk where we were even given complimentary wi fi for our stay
