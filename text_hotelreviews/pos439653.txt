staff were very friendly and attentive particularly the algerian french concierge whose name i sadly didn t get from greeting us politely as we arrived to immediately coming to the rescue when the keycard to our door proved faulty we had to wait twenty minutes for the issue to be resolved but were then offered a room upgrade to club class to compensate us for the very little inconvenience excellent service in a hotel of plus rooms where we might have felt like just another couple of guests top marks we also loved the convenience of the location just moments away from high street kensington tube
