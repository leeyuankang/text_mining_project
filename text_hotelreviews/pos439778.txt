was at copthorne tara last year also two rooms as with adult children wonderful hence my re booking and moving after four days to spend the next days at another establishment nearby location what a shame you will see from my previous review my adult children and i were delighted at the hospitality on that occassion different ambience in the main was not writing a review but did due to constant nagging by booking com and that is another story
