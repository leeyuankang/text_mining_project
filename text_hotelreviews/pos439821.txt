i liked how diverse the breakfast choice was and the facilities were great staff were friendly and the hotel is very close to the main high street and tube station for south kensington there are also shops and eateries within the hotel in addition to us being given access to the club members room not sure why where we were given the opportunity to go and have canopies and drinks that evening they have a luggage holding area that was great for us as check out was hours before we were due to leave
