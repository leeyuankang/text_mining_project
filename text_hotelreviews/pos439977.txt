the beds were very comfortable the staff was friendly the place was quite clean they had a full array of bath products much better than the very common all in one wall mounted dispenser a personal pet peeve of mine as a woman traveller it was only a few minutes walk from the tube and bus stops and there was a very nice little chain cafe called nero on the way to the tube where we ate breakfast twice the muffin man teahouse was also good but i m not sure i would recommend it i had the feeling that the staff wasn t treated well by the owner there was also plenty of shopping just across the street from the nearest tube check out was very quick if your tab is taken care of all you have to do is drop your keys in the bowl on the counter
