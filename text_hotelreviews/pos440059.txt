i stayed for nights just simply left in the morning and came back in the evening i didn t ask for neither breakfast nor wifi the hotel is near high street kensington tube station with different sorts of shops like boots mc donal s within min of walking the room was large enough for a couple with an iron which was very handy i had room service everyday and they were very honest because i left money laptops and opened suitcases but they were at the same place when i came back
