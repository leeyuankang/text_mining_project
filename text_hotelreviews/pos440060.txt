we arrive very late the staff were very welcoming and friendly the room was very clean and beds extra comfy the best night sleep in a long time the shower was fantastic really like the nice touch of an iron and ironing board was already in the room and we didn t have to ask reception excellent value for money in central london we will definitely stay again when visiting london
