the room was a good size with very good amenities like a safe fridge and ironing facility the towels were just right breakfast had a great choice and yes i like the croissants we chose it because it was quite near the royal opera house although we required a taxi as we felt it was a bit to far for us to walk the staff were all smiling and helpful
