although the hotel is a little dated tired in certain areas the location staff make up for this every staff member i came across from reception to breakfast to the two lovely girls in the chinese restaurant were absolutely the best i have ever encountered i stay in many hotels as its my job the difference with the staff at this hotel is that they genuinely seemed to be happy therefore it was not forced which really makes a difference we had therefore a very safe happy stay
