although breakfast is served in the main bar and not in a restaurant the choice is very good but moreover all of the staff of which there are many are very polite attentive and very efficient before going to a concert at the royal albert hall we ate at the singapore restaurant the food was delicious and the service here was excellent too parking at the hotel is very good value for money with plenty of spaces under cover nothing was too much trouble at the tara well done
