lovely area close to underground main hotel foyer was very nice we didn t eat in the hotel preferring to go out to a couple of restaurants nearby ffiona s for evening meal fantastic bill s for breakfast good value for money rooms were described as superior but were really just your average hotel room clean comfortable but fairly basic bathroom was small but adequate
