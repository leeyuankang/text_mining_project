after difficult trip and late arrival a very friendly receptionist told me that i would be upgraded to a floor room which was spacious by u s standards clean with a lovely view the breakfast supplemental cost with most rooms was good as far as buffets go especially since espresso is available full breakfast available at additional charge i wound up eating in the two restaurants and enjoyed my selections at both again good for hotel food around the corner from the circle line tube so very convenient
