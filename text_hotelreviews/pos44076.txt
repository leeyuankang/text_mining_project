pleasantly the hotel was within walking distance of nearly everything that we wanted museums theater restaurants it was priced affordably and was well maintained all staff were clearly exceptional we travel a lot and have seen nearly everything this one was superior when it comes to staff breakfast was very good and wait staff were among the best we will stay here again
