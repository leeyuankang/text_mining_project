we stayed in a small double room after reading some reviews i was a bit hesitant as they seemed to think it was too small however i found it a good size and not too small at all the room was really comfortable the bed was great the inclusion of a mini fridge in the room meant that we could bring back chilled refreshments which is a great addition for big tea drinkers like we were the bathroom facilities are also a really good size the hotel overall is very modern very clean and efficient and the staff very accommodating check in was quick and simple as was check out the hotel was nice and quiet we barely saw or heard other guests the location is excellent close to euston station and within walking distance of the west end and covent garden
