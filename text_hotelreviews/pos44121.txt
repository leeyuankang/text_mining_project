ideal location for central london very close to russell square underground station hotel staff all lovely rooms clean and comfortable on site marco pierre white restaurant didn t have breakfast as we felt each was very expensive and decided to find somewhere cheaper to eat hotel close to lots of lovely bars and restaurants would definitely use hotel again
