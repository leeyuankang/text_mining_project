nice breakfast welcoming staff great location room small but very comfortable noise was an issue at the front of the building but earplugs are provided could have done with more teabags and uht milk in the room only one of each provided on arrival and not replaced for night but i m sure if i d asked they would have brought me some overall pleasant enough
