the location was excellent the british museum is within walking distance close to theatres and many restaurants the nearest underground entrance exit was only a few short blocks away our room was very nice as per their online advertisement clean and quiet staff are lovely and very helpful during our day stay they kept our luggage to ensure we enjoyed our last day and arranged a cab to take us to heathrow
