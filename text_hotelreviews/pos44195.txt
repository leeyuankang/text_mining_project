brilliant location for theatres and covent garden was about a walk took about to walk to london eye about a min walk from st pancras station loads of restaurants convenience shops and bars close by staff were really helpful and polite breakfast was well worth the money website advertised it as per person so i didn t pre book as i thought this was pricey but when we were at the hotel it was only each and definitely worth it eat as much as you like buffet and unlimited drinks can t fault this hotel at all
