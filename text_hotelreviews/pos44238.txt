we stayed at the mecure bloomsbury for a single night check in out was seamless we had erroneously booked a double room instead of a twin the reception staff member was exceptionally helpful in accommodating our change in room request although understandably noted that this would not always be possible our room was clean with contemporary decor and excellent facilities while a little on the small side the room still provided excellent value for price paid all staff were very friendly we highly recommend the breakfast buffet where no expense is spared to diners we will definitely use the mecure again
