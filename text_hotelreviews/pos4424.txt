beautiful traditional hotel loved being greeted and helped with luggage by concierge no queues when checking in or out hotel staff happy and helpful really nice bar area very comfortable for passing a couple of hours on a rainy day only down side bath plug broken so water drained out while trying to have a bath and very slippy even with bath mat i slipped twice and my daughter had a bad fall hitting her head other than that was a lovely big room with a fab view of russell square
