friendly and helpful staff room facilities a very comfortable bed fridge espresso coffee maker kettle small ish bathroom but adquate and the toiletries were a nice touch great location close to bus and underground routes on the first day when i arrived a bit earlier the hotel stored my luggage and then when i checked in they had already delivered my luggage in to the room a very nice gesture much appreciated
