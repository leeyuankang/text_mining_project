when we arrived they offered us a great solution for secure parking and wifi just a bit over the price i reserved our rooms we arrived by in the night and still we got great service by really nice people breakfast was great thanks gy rgy for helping us out with our problems and morning coffees having tea and coffee in the room was great in this season the location is also a must why you have to rent your rooms here
