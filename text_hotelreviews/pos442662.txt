very close to the tube station for quick access to the city centre immediate area was fine and you can walk to the city centre in mins good facilities although bar staff very slow breakfast was good value for money and waiting staff were lovely only complaint was the bed which was too soft but that s personal preference overall a fine place to stay for a long weekend
