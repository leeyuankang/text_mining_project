for business in schoenbrunn excellent location min walk from schoenbrunn very comfortable business category room with large bed wifi and breakfast breakfast buffet was really good fresh and delicious service and friendliness of staff deserves extra bonus if you are looking for some vienna traditional restaurant don t choose anything than the famous plachutta in hietzing which is less than km away and try the tafelspitz nowhere else ever found better than there
