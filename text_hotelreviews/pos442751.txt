the hotel is about a min walk from the subway very clean rooms quite modern in style excellent breakfast as well some very fine restaurants within walking distance the parking we were given there is about three blocks down from the hotel which you open with a remote that is given to you by the front desk person very convenient overall an excellent hotel
