i simply loved my stay here everything went beyond my expectations the room was very clean and tidy and the bed was great the location is perfect i never used the subway to move around i really enjoy walking though the hotel is minutes away from the biggest food market of vienna naschmarkt finally they provide free coffee cappuccinos milk hot chocolate or whatever hot drink you like i would really recommend this place if you plan to stay in vienna next time i visit vienna i ll definitely stay there
