we had a terrible experience in the nearby hotel papageno where we were refused of stay even though we had a reservation made months in advance the staff of la prima fashion hotel vienna was very friendly we had a free upgrade to a better room the hotel was very clean conveniently located near metro station which is stops away from vienna center quiet great breakfast
