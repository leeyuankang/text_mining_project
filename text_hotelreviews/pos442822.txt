the desk attendant i wish i would have had her write down her name but it may have been aneeka was amazing in her cheerfulness and willingness to help i was not in a great mood when i arrived at the hotel since air france had lost my luggage i was delayed from waiting in lines at the airport to fill out the necessary paperwork fro lost luggage as i checked in i inquired about any place to eat nearby since it was already getting late and she recommended an nearby italian restaurant and gave me a coupon for a free dessert the dinner was great next day she happily informed me that my luggage had arrived from it s unplanned vacation sadly she was not there when i checked out but this hotel would do well to keep her on staff in fact i suggest that they give her a pay raise
