great location lots of restaurants and shops in this area plenty of tasty asian food around mins walk or tram stops to the main square or to the belvedere residence spacious and clean room good for couples with small children who needs some space equipped with a minibar coffee machine and everything needed for comfortable stay a c was a relief because it was outside very good free wifi decent breakfast we were travelling by car there s no private parking in the hotel but you can park the car on the street and buy parking tickets at the reception but pay attention to the signs there are some lots reserved for police and disabled people by the way the parking is free of charge on the weekend generally i would recommend this hotel for all travellers
