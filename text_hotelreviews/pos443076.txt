great hotel very nice room we liked the bath in the middle of the room very romantic grate breakfast modern decoration very nice view free apples at the reception were nice we didn t got our baby cot when we got to the room but it was fixed in min so no really issue need to indicate also that the price is one of the lowest compare to other rooms hotels in amsterdam which make this deal very good and worth
