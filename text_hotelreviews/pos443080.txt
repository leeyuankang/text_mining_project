we had a nice stay at fletcher hotel the beds are super comfy the room is just big enough for people the bar and restaurant upstairs are beautiful just to sit and have a quite drink or to grab a morning coffee don t remember his name but we had a lovely waiter on our first morning he definitely set our day to a good start so bright and bubbly it made a massive difference to our first morning we didn t eat in the hotel restaurant so unable to comment on the food but the setting is lovely the train station is about min walk which was okay as we had lovely weather but the hotel do also run a shuttle service to the station very easy train journey to the central overall had a nice stay would definitely consider staying here again if i came back to amsterdam
