great unusual expercience to stay in this hotel the design of the rooms and hotel itself is unique giving extra spirit to the stay recommend for the fresh couples nice shower solution the view from the room was also amazing bar great kitchen we didnt manage to try parking without any problems a bit further from the trains heading to the city but with hotel shuttle service every hour from hotel its ok when coming back its a nice mins walk just straight from the train stop so easy to find really worth to try it definitely
