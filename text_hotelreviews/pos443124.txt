the hotel is a little bit far from the center of amsterdam but if you go there with a car it is an excellent place to stay as the parking is free of charge normally per hour in amsterdam the restaurant in the floor is nice an the food is ok the quality of the bed is excellent but forget the pillow bring you own one
