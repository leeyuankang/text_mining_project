finally my little girl s dream came true to stay in the bubble hotel beautiful hotel from the outside with a swish modern interior and the view from inside is excellent our room was overlooking the freeways interesting to see the cars racing way below staff are friendly rooms are clean parking is free breakfast is not bad location is not close to trains or trams but handy to a group of fast food restaurants across the road burger king kfc pizza pasta and wok there is a big lake across the highway via a bike path bridge which is quite a nice walk with lots of birds no extra charge for a year old and free breakfast for her which was nice of the man in charge at breakfast
