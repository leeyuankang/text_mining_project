for us since we wanted to go to the ziggo dome the location was perfect we took our bikes and it s less than a bike ride to the arena square i think they also offer a shuttle bus service obviously the hotel tower looks attractive especially at night with the blue color the rooms are special with a circle shower in the middle of the room we got free welcome drinks which we enjoyed in the lounge bar on the floor with a very nice view
