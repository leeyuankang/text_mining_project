the fletcher hotel was a gift in many ways although it is not close to the city center inside the center hotels prices were outrageous and this one was reasonable this hotel went out of their way to make getting into the center easy by providing a transport to the metro station which we used the sphere shaped hotel and round round glass shower in the middle of the room were definitely a novelty and added spice to the stay it seemed to have a nice restaurant although we did not use it we would stay there again we also appreciated the free covered parking receptionists were accommodating
