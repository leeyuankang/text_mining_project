brilliant staff so friendly we put our do not disturb on the door every day an took it off when we went out and the maid still cleaned the room the room was spotless had some english channels too which was a bonus great view aswell walk from a connection train to amsterdam central station my advice use the train to get to the hotel from airport as the taxi there was no shops around the hotel so if you need anything grab it in the town really nice all round thank you
