the room was very spacious compared to other double rooms in amsterdam hotels the beds were extremely comfortable but the mattress does tend to slide about as long as you are comfortable being naked around whoever you are sharing a room with the shower is good the hotel has a free shuttle to metro station which is helpful and they can also arrange a taxi service for wherever else you need to go the bar restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly as i only stayed here because the location was close to the amsterdam arena i m not sure if i would stay again but i would recommend it to others a taxi from the airport cost us around
