i liked how hot the water was usually hotels have freezing water so that made me happy the shower actually worked which also was amazing as nothing ever works in most hotels i love the fantastic layout of the hotel so smart oh and your chips that you serve were banging also that bus service you do to the station is so handy i think you guys deserve a star for that also one of your workers gave me and my boyfriend a lift to burger king which was soooo sweet of him massive shout out to him
