this hotel is the best hotel i have ever visited in europe i travel around a lot and have made a lot of comparisons it has a friendly staff who speak multiple languages their rooms are clean they have the sexiest glass shower ever in the middle of the bedroom and they serve dinner which is reserved for a king very lovely place anyone who wants to be treated like royalty should book a place at this fabulous place they offer a free shuttle service to holendrecht tube station as well making it convenient to get to town without stress their rates are very moderate as well i was there on the of april jorn nana van brobbey
