the architecture and the room design are original and interesting good food and wine in restaurant the location is good if you go to a concert or sport event at zigo dome or amsterdam arena also if you have business in amstel business area quite far to downtown however metro train station si close like minutes walking or you can use hotel s shuttle bus free of charge also you can hire a bike from the hotel we did this and it was great
