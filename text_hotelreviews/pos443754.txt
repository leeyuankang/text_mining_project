the location was great overlooking the park and near the schonbrunn palace all areas of the hotel were spotless comfortable relaxed and the breakfast buffet superb majority of staff were pleasant and very helpful only one member of bar staff was less so but i think that was due to his being under pressure as the only staff member working in a busy bar the hotel was good value for money access to the city centre was less than minutes on the metro
