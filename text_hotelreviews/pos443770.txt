we loved the quiet location with easy access to trams for transportation into city center the bed was great and the room was very nice and comfortable at night it was really quiet great the free minibar in our room was a nice service to be able to get a cold drink after a day in the city the executive lounge was big and comfotable with a few snacks and drinks sch nbrunn is just a short walk away but if you like you can also take the tram i would advise to get a or hour ticket for the public transport really convenient we very much enjoyed our stay
