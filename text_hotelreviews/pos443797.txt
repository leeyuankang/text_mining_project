a beautifully clean and bright modern hotel with lovely large rooms great breakfast with all you could want lovely staff who were very attentive when needed nice bar and restaurant easy walking distance down the hill to the underground with easy to read connections close to the palace which is beautiful plenty of trams within yards of the hotel if you knew where you were going and the relevant numbers if we had been there longer we would have figured them out we would use this hotel on a return trip so that speaks volumes
