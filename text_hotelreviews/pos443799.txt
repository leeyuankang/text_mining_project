nice rooms and quiet bathroom well equipped and clean especially the spaces between the tiles in the shower are often a bit filthy but in this case nothing at all the only thing we found was a small spot on the carpet behind the entrance door of the room but this really was minor the room itself in nice colors good mattresses very friendly and professional service person in the restaurant alltogether a nice star hotel with the wonderful schloss sch nbrunn just around the corner
