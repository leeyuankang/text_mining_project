check was good the receptionist was smiling and helpful was a guy but when we cancelled the taxi in the evening to pick us up in the morning they still called us from the reception very early in the morning we cancelled the taxi before we went to bed so we could sleep more and stay for one more day the reception forgot to give the message that we didn t want to be disturb the tv in the room wasn t working at all the receptionist came to our room in the evening to see what was wrong with the tv they couldn t find what was wrong they were so kind and helpful and very polite the guys in the reception restaurant food was good but the old guy who served us didn t even smiled he wasn t friendly but the little guy who served us the coffee was very kind and polite
