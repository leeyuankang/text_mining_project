location was ideal for those who want to visit the schonbrunn palace the rooms were very clean and ideal for a romantic getaway or a weekend with a couple friends it was across the street from the streetcars and a short min walk to the nearest metro with ease of access to the city center the staff were friendly and polite i would definitely stay here again
