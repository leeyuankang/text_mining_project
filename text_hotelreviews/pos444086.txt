the location of the hotel is in a superb area we went for a christmas trip and it was close to the local markets and only a twenty minute walk to the big markets if walking seems far it is actually a bonus because you get to view everything as you walk only a euro uber ride to and from the airport the hotel room was warm and cosy and had all the facilities
