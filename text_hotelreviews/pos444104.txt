i love the gym small but very good machines i love the breakfast good choice though the scrambled eggs looked very unappetizing but lots of fruit and veggies and nuts and so on missing the herring they always used to have great policy to have apples around at the reception all day long and coffee in the morning the water with the fruit gets problematic by the afternoon good location nice staff would welcome more deals not just for the weekend
