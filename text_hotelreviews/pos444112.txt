great room great coffee machine and lovely modern hotel thought i d comment on the location which seems to get mixed reviews if you re lazy this isn t the place for you clearly you do have to walk places but it s about to minutes to hofberg palace and the rathaus so it s hardly very far also the location is in a relatively quiet area which is nice and is near the spittelberg area which has good well priced local restaurants and pubs the zieglergasse underground is less than a minute walk away too handy for transport to further out places like the hauptbahnhoff took about minutes with one change all in all we were very happy with the location especially for the price we paid about euros per night
