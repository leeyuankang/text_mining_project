the hotel staff were excellent starting with the reception staff who were very helpful to the staff in the hotel bar and then to the staff in the executive lounge who were extremely engaging and helpful the rooms were very comfortable but because of the location the views were limited we were also opposite a building being renovated and the workman began their day very early this didn t detract from our stay in the hotel though as we spent most of the day out walking around the city it is worthwhile paying a little bit extra to have access to the executive lounge where we could eat our breakfast without any hassle and spend the early evening eating from a good selection of food and drink we did find it a little expensive in the hotel bar so being able to spend time in the executive lounge where all drinks were free of charge helped make our stay an extremely enjoyable experience
