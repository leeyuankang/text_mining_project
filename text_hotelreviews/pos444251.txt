hilton vienna plaza provides comfortable accommodation and a great location within walking distance of historical center for quite reasonable price access to the nearest underground station is literally just around the corner checking in and out took only couple of minutes and our room was nice clean and fully equipped breakfast was great with all you would expect from a five star hotel good coffee is a big plus part of the deal was an access to the executive lounge which was supposed to offer light snack only however we were also pleasantly surprised with hot soup two cooked meals and abundance of soft drinks and more than fair amount of liquor and wine
