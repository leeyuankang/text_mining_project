this hotel surpassed expectations with its spanky and clean five star room we really enjoyed coming back to the hotel to rest after long days of exploring the city we were welcomed with cherries and chocolate as well which was really sweet note that despite the hotel not being located in the middle of the main attractions the walk was short and scenic so we enjoyed exploring the city from here everyday
