the hotel staff were extremely friendly and attentive and were very patient with our lack of german the breakfast was fantastic and plentiful there was a great selection of both hot and cold food so something for everybody we paid a little extra for a bigger room and were happy we did because it meant getting a city view as well the staff were also very accommodating with our one year old son providing us with a cot and a highchair for the room this hotel lives up to its well deserved good reputation and we would stay here again
