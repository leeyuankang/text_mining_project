the hotel is still new the hallways are spacious the staff are very quick to do everything you ask the porters are the fastest i ve seen in any hotel the junior suite was spacious and really comfortable but the only issue was that it had ants all over that got into my baby s stuff but when they were informed and when we asked to extend for a day last minute we were given a much bigger suite which made up for the packing and unpacking that we had to do and for the ant issue as well the room service was really good as well everything was really good i loved this hotel
