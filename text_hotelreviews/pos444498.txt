breakfast was outstanding a great selection of things not to mention a cook available for you to make some omelettes or scrambled eggs staff is great king size bed is reallly big in our superior room we had a nespresso coffee maker which was complementary and a nice detail wifi was working well you need to remember the basic package has a limit up to devices
