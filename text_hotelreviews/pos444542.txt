our second stay at this hotel which should have been enjoyable as first but was spoilt by being offered a paid upgrade room that was not at all clean as would be expected of hotel the alternative better room offered had a broken tv the rooms themselves and beds in particular were very comfortable and superb breakfast that on saturday continues to the location of the hotel is good for walking to the old town area staff were helpful
