the location is excellent with a short walk to vienna s old town the bar is very pricey approximately double local pub prices we ate at the hotel once which was perfectly pleasant the junior suite we had was nice the view was ugly but we were overlooking the roofs of other commercial buildings breakfast was extraordinary herrings and cooked broccoli were on the menu a good buffet style breakfast covered every angle the staff were very helpful and all had good english
