very nice location rooms have that traditional vienna style big enough with over ceiling height though our room faced the main street noise level was relatively low we had floor breakfast was good enough though adding salmon and fresh orange juice would make it perfect all in all this was a good value for money in vienna we booked this hotel with secret deal option
