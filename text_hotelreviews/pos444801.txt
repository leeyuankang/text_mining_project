the staff were excellent they were extremely helpful their advice to take the bus tour on the day of our arrival was inspired it meant that we saw vienna in the sun they also booked a number of restaurants for us their help made our stay stress free the hotel is in an excellent location it is within walking distance of many major attractions i also enjoyed listening to the piano playing in the bar
