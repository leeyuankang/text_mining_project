the breakfast is really excellent this was our year staying in this hotel and now the wifi throughout the hotel is good even if one did have to renew their access code every hours i love the location of the hotel which is perfect for traveling on the u bahn or the trams visiting the film festival at rathaus and for access to the main city centre they were also excellent in dealing with our requests regarding our year old daughter who was traveling with us we will definitely stay here again
