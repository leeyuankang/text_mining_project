the location can t be beaten it s walking distance to main attractions although the hotel is old and looks impressive it is friendly and welcoming so are the staff who were going over themselves to satisfy all our requests it is spotlessly clean convenient valet parking available great breakfast very good wifi i will definitely return it was my best stay ever in vienna
