great selection at breakfast friendly staff clean room and comfortable beds location is excellent because the metro station is literally a stone s throw away and the hotel is pretty much walking distance to the main tourist attractions value for money for a luxurious stay in vienna we booked many months in advance only point of discomfort is that our room is very noisy because it s along the main road so we had to keep our windows shut during the hot summer days the air conditioning works perfectly though to be fair to the hotel we ended up with the room we did because we asked for a room with a view if possible and the hotel specially arranged for us to have a view of the bank of austria along the main road the hotel staff must have quite a sense of humour
