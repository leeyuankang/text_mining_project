very luxurious staff was friendly and very professional not at all stiff as i had expected which is a very good thing breakfast was nice and had a big variety to pick from room was clean lots of space and a wonderful view close to everything one would want to see in vienna we in particular enjoyed the s feeling withing the hotel which gave us a nice break from the otherwise romantic gothic baroque vibe of the city
