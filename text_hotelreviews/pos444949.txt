good location clean great breakfast was included in our rate the pillows were well below par we asked for additional ones but it was still insufficient making for uncomfortable sleep otherwise the beds were fine tv was from not of much use wifi codes needed to be renewed daily with lengthy alpha numeric codes which was annoying but it was free so that offset the pain as rooms and food go in vienna we got value for what we paid
