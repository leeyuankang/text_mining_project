this was our first visit to vienna and we found a junior suite at the hotel de france for the same price as a standard double in similar hotels my wife has got mobility issues and the hotel arranged the hire of a wheelchair for the duration of our stay and we had access to the whole hotel the staff were brilliant and ensured we were always content we recommend this hotel to all our friends and family the owner should be rightly proud of all his staff from his driver who picked us up from the airport to front of house staff to the cleaners outstanding service thank you
