very friendly and helpful staff we booked an early morning trip so we were too early for breakfast however one of the staff brought us coffee and croissants in the comfy chairs in the foyer instead the location was ideal for walking into the centre and the weather was lovely comfortable bed and large room would definitely recommend this hotel
