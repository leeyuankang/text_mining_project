we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in hotel de france wien staff very friendly and helpful really good location underground and tram a couple of hundred meters from main entrance excellent breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere the live piano music in the bar at night when having a nightcap was a lovely bonus would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
