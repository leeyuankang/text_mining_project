lovely well run hotel stylish friendly and in a great location we travel a lot for work and it s a pleasure to find a place which puts all the important things first despite arriving late around midnight the staff made a welcoming pot of tea the bedroom was spotlessly clean cool quiet and with simple shutters on the windows the bed was comfortable crisp white linen and a proper austrian duvet after a good night s sleep breakfast on the roof terrace the next morning was a real treat
