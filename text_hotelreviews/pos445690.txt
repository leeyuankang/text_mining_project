we have had a lovely stay at grand ferdinand the highlight each day was breakfast on the roof terrace this is a sun filled conservatory with outside balcony the breakfast choice is amazing i would strongly recommend including this when booking this hotel the breakfast staff are delightful all in all for us a perfect choice of hotel to stay for new year
