it is just my type of hotel unconventional top quality the candles and the horse in the lobby just set the mood and the banker table lamps on white marble of the reception give the idea of the level of service the floor is just amazing in terms of style and furniture the grand ferdinand is like the ideal house if dreams were possible on top it has also the best view of the city an open air swimming pool an amazing breakfast and dinner i was escaping to the hotel everytime i had a few free minutes the rooms are exactly as i could make my own home and the staff is approachable friendly but with class just want to go there again soon ah and you are so much in the city center that you can walk everywhere
