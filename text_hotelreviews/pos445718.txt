we loved the atmosphere of this hotel the staff were fantastic we ate each day in the terrace restaurant and were welcomed each day like old friends the reception staff were pleasant and totally helpful the interiors are a little baroque and the only negative was lack of hanging space great situation for a trip to the opera and concerts will stay there again when we visit vienna great work grand ferdinando
