stunningly presented hotel that makes an impression with their design choices as soon as you enter the top floor restaurant offers a superb view of vienna s skyline as does the somewhat surreal pool the standard double room i stayed in struck a beautiful balance between brutalist design and austrian elegance don t expect much privacy if you re travelling as a couple the central shopping district is a short walk away and plenty of green space is nearby several fantastic restaurants are also within an easy stroll though the hotel s own offerings were great as well
