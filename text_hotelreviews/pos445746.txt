exellent location lovely rooftop restaurant posh interior and well supplied rooms we loved the welcoming attitude of the hotel staff and waiters had a free bottle of still water waiting for us just a small detail but after our long journey it felt pleasant we took the breakfast and were not disappointed after an excellent dinner the day before would definitely recommend for travelers who love comfortable and well located hotels
