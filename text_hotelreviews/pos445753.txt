the room was very stylish with lots of lovely details and a brilliant shower modern facilities but still feels comfortable and a great view of the street below the rooftop pool and bar was exactly what we needed to kick start our stay in vienna and the staff were very attentive the bed was extremely comfortable maybe the best we ve slept in the hotel is in a superb location so close to stadtpark and to the opera house it is a lovely area
