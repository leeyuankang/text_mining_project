hotel had ambiance and character the restaurant on the floor had a fantastic view was comfortable with diverse seating food and drink was brought to your table quickly and service was attentive breakfast was good the restaurant downstairs had austrian fare and was very tasty somewhat a little overpriced though service was excellent bedrooms were very comfortable and stylishly decorated location is central close to the shops and restaurants all within walking distance would definitely stay at the grand ferdinand again
