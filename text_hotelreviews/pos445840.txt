we liked the d cor which was a modern urban style the beds were very comfortable there wasn t a lounge area in the lobby but there was a caf style area beside the ground floor dining room or a lounge area on the top floor where you could sit and read the staff were on the whole very helpful the entrance area was lit up with candles at night which looked very chic there was an open air pool on the top floor but it was quite small and the weather a bit too cold though i imagine quite nice to sit in in the summer
