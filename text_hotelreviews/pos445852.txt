newly opened property as at early oct so the interior including furnishings are all new and the staff were eager to please and certainly professional the food in the onsite restaurant austrian hungarian was also quite good the one night we chose to eat dinner in the hotel and the rooftop bar enclosed was a nice enough space perhaps a little more soul and it could be better above all the location and proximity to the old town is terrific ten minutes walk gets you to most of the key attractions or points of interest and the central shopping areas there are also decent restaurants close by our taxi from airport cost us outside rush hour and taxi to westbahnhof train station on departing was
