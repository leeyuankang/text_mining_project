after we failed to checkin to another property we booked for our stay as we were running late and the property wasn t answering during their checkin hours we were left out on the street late in the evening we were desperately looking for a last minute shelter in vienna that won t cost us a fortune i booked this property before checkin time and phoned them to let them know that we are on our way asked them to please wait for us they actually answered the phone unlike the previous property and waited for us unlike the previous property the receptionist was very nice and helpful we were very happy with the service
