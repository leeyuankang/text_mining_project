the staff were extremely helpful and friendly could not fault them at all the location was ideal as everything you wanted was within walking distance the rooms were decent size extremely clean however only a bath in the bathroom and no shower which was inconvenient breakfast also was so very expensive but there were many places to eat very close by overall all good value for money
