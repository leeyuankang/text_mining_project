took my fianc e to vienna for a big birthday the ritz carlton is class personified and so central to all the main attractions a hotel that actually lives up to its rating i couldn t fault a single thing even had a free room upgrade room pool cocktail bar and restaurant all excellent paid for a club room the exclusive club lounge provided light meals during the day if needed including breakfast it s obviously not cheap to stay here but with a discount it was very good value and i fully recommend
