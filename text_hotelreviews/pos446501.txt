i can only comment from my experience i had a single room with small dressing room wardrobe ensuite facilities if you want to experience a little bit of old austria then this is the place the facilities were very modern suberb shower safe fridge etc but the decor which was clean and fresh reflected an older period right in the middle of vienna next door to the central cathedral yet on a quiet street with one way through traffic breakfast is cooked and served to order with a buffet for the usual fruit bread etc etc
