our friends collected us from vienna airport and we arrived late afternoon the hotel staff were really friendly and helpful we liked the fact that this hotel goes back to the and had a real warm and cosy feel the room was lovely and big with bathroom and separate toilet we requested a room overlooking the lovely courtyard and small bar which is quieter than street side but that wasn t too busy either the hotel is less than a minute s walk to st stephens cathedral and all the bars and restaurants so it s perfect for exploring the city centre also the underground is about a two minute walk which is great for going to the various attractions we didn t need help with tours or information as our friends are viennese so they showed us around however there was a lot of information in the foyer at the hotel the staff are very helpful and will tell you everything you need to know and would probably help you to organise your day my friend asked how much we paid for our accommodation and she said that it was really good value being right in the district of the city we had a lovely time in vienna and at this hotel and were sad to leave
