right in the middle of vienna s centre just behind stephan cathedral everything you want to see in walking distance many nice restaurants in the area hotel is not ultra modern but in a nice traditional viennese style as you might expect though most people will want to explore restaurants around town the restaurant in the hotel is really good many traditional dishes well prepared staff very kind and helpful
