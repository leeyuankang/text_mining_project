desk staff very helpful with arrangements for concerts directions transportation dining staff very pleasant and service was swift although we were allowed to linger good breakfast buffet made more special by being able to order egg dishes sausage and even gulasch at no extra cost central location two minutes from the dom but still quiet my daughter and her husband had a very spacious room and bath enjoyed the modern decor upstairs with tradition maintained in the public rooms the garden room lobby is especially nice
