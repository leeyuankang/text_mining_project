i really liked the caring friendly staff who gave wonderful service the hotel was ideally located and has great amenities the building is old but has modern conveniences the air conditioning was superb which was wonderful because it was very hot outside the breakfast is excellent there were many hot and cold choices including fresh fruit i would highly recommend this hotel
