it s a boutique hotel but the staff are worth the most renowned hotels very nice and highly professional sayyed at the reception is probably the most efficient concierge in town with advice and access to the best restaurants and music events room in the annex building was very spacious elegantly decorated and very clean amazingly the huge bathroom has a view on saint stephan dome the breakfast is delicious and varied with cold and warm plates i ll certainly come back to this hotel
