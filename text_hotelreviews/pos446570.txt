i booked this hotel because of its history and i liked the location that seemed to be close to stephanplatz but didn t realize that it was so close and so convenient to everything two minute walk and we were at stephanplatz still we could sleep peacefully at night we stayed in a bed room and the room was amazing the nicely decorated room on the lower floor had a double bed with a small living area small area for minibar cabinet etc and one toilet and a nice bathroom the stairs lead to an upper attic room fit for a young princess nicely decorated too feeling more like staying in a small historic house instead of a room the lobby was very amazing too with high cieling and ancient atmosphere everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful i have already recommended the hotel to one of our family members
