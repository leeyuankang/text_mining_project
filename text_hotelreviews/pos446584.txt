the hotel was in a fantastic situation just a couple of hundred metres from st stephen s cathedral so very central it was traditional and cosy with a lovely internal glass roofed courtyard with a bar with comfortable seating the room was large and we were offered a choice of traditional decor or a more modern room the bathroom was spacious well equipped and absolutely immaculate the hotel was also very quiet at night we ate a really nice meal on the first evening and breakfast was generous and varied the staff could not have been more helpful overall an excellent hotel well placed peaceful and very comfortable
