the female receptionist was lovely coming from a train from salzburg she i forgot her name greeted us with a cheerful attitude the closet in our room had a lot of useful compartments this hotel is near stephanplatz when you turn left on the street the hotel is located you will be shocked to immediately see stephan s church you can climb the narrow tower but it will be quite a journey more than steps euros for an adult the spanish riding school is less than minutes by foot from there you can walk straight to the museum quarter less than minutes also you will see designer stores in this area bring a water bottle with you because there are several trinkwasser booths were you can refill them you can take the bus or the tram something i personally did not do because i find bus routes to be very confusing i highly suggest the hop on hop off bus take a hour ticket for all the lines euros per adult and it will be worth it the easiest one to find is in the museum quarter the yellow line takes you to schonbrunn palace belvedere where dur kuss or the kiss is located this is difficult to go to by yourself so take the hop on hop off book a tour with royal tours euros per adult totally worth it it s a small bus it can fit about people with one man as the driver and guide it is great i suggest prague over budapest we did not take the salzburg a beautiful place so take the tour if you were not ale to stay the night because we just came from there
