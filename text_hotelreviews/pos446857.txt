it was nice coming back to hotel domizil everything was very nice and the staff was very friendly as well the location is ideal just a couple of steps away from stephansplatz and the subway from where you can get to many places in town and to the central railway station the room was very spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable the bathroom was very clean too everything at the breakfast was fresh and the staff was very helpful i would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting vienna because i think it s the best hotel in the city centre
