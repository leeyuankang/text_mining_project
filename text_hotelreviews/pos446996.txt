i had a single room but it was a very reasonable size and the bed was much wider than a normal single very comfortable i very much liked the decor of the rooms and everything was very fresh and clean the staff were friendly and helpful the breakfasts were excellent lots of variety in the buffet the free afternoon tea was a very welcome bonus all in all i can t recommend this hotel highly enough
