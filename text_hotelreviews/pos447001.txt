excellent location very good breakfast choices nice to see hot food choices such as fried egg and bacon as well as the more continental offerings which were also very good especially the blue cheese and hams exceptionally helpful staff in all areas very quiet but effective air conditioning meant no compromise between noise and temperature was necessary hence a good night s sleep nice to have the ability to book airport transfers both ways and put the cost on the bill we took up this option and it worked out perfectly good range of restaurants nearby including a great street food kiosk with wursts falafel pizza and best of all kebabs the hotel is on the doorstop on the hop on off bus and the ringstrasse and other teams tickets for the bus can be bought at the hotel and put on the bill you get a printed voucher which you exchange for the tickets on the bus i think you can also buy the vienna card too all in all a great stay in a superb hotel at a great location in a beautiful city
