this was a fantastic hotel it was very clean and i loved the location it was a quick walk to st stephen s but also had great access to the bratislava ferry across the street and all key sites including schonbrunn via public transit given it s location in schwedenplatz also the location to catch the tourist ring tram the breakfast was also great you can order your eggs any way you like as you can also do with your coffee the staff from the folks at the front desk to the breakfast team were all excellent and very friendly the room also had really nice air conditioning that actually worked well contrary to a number of european hotels i would definitely stay here again and the wifi was excellent as well
