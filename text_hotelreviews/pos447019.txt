hotel capricorno was a very pleasant surprise the location at schweden platz is very good a minute walk from the u bahn station and easy to arrive from the airport the staff were very nice and informative and the room was comfortable and practical very clean each room i think has a balcony i had a bad weather but in sunny days i guess it should be very nice breakfast was very nice a good selection of food and fresh eggs are served it also offers free cakes at the afternoon didn t expect this one this hotel has the perfect balance between luxury and modesty had a great time
