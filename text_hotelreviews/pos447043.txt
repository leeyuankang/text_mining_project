really loved this hotel and it provided all i needed for my short stay in vienna good location with lovely room overlooking the donaukanal the staff were so good that breakfast team were incredible always smiling and welcoming no matter how many people turned up at the same time for their great breakfast i sadly never had time for the afternoon teas as i was traveling so much
