the hotel was in an excellent location the breakfast was very good and the staff very attentive and friendly the rooms were fairly small but very comfortable and clean we went with family and had rooms and asked for tea and coffee making facilities which were provided immediately along with some extra pillows nothing was too much trouble and i would definitely recomend this hotel and stay there again
