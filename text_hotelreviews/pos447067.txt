the rooms were comfortable and very quiet we were located close to the breakfast serving area and couldn t hear a thing until we opened our door the breakfast staff were very pleasant and responsive breakfast was also nice this hotel is super close to the underground and to airport bus services it was an easy walk to the city center area
