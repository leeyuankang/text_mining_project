i stayed in two different rooms during my stay the first room was a single room in the back and the second was a double room facing the busy street the double room was more comfortable with a balcony even though it was facing the street when the windows were closed for the most part the room was quieter than expected the breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly and helpful the location is excellent
