breakfast excellent beds comfortable and our room was clean and had a terrace it was the only hotel we stayed in eastern europe in early april that had a working air conditioning system to cool down the room at night the location was great the schwedenplatz subway station was right down the street from the hotel good location if you are going to take the cat train to the airport as only stop to the main rail station walking distance to all downtown sights
