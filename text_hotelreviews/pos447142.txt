excellent location great interior decor and very helpful friendly staff but what i liked the most was that breakfast was available until i m not the earliest riser and it slightly annoys me when hotels set their breakfast up between to or something silly like that i was able to get up leisurely not set an alarm and toddle off to breakfast when i wanted to the breakfast was also amazing if i go back to vienna which i will because it s beautiful and we loved it i will stay at hotel capricorno
