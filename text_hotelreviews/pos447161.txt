the staff were the most courteous and friendly i have encountered in a long time rooms were comfortable and very clean and the cleaning staff had an eye for detail the free coffee and cake and board games supplied in the dining room during the evening is a really nice touch especially after being out all day very close to the metro line which was really handy and only short walk to the main square
