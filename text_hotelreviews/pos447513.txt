it my nd stay in the holel i do believe that this hotel has the best location in milano breakfast was much better than last year fresh with good variety clean and modern rooms with good sound isolation lovely to walk back from la scala after light dinner friendly staff quite near shopping area and easy to leave heavy bags after prada and louis vitton in the room definitely come back
