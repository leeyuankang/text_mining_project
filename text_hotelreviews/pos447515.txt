the hotel has an excellent location very close to the duomo the staff are friendly and tried their best to accommodate us when we had a plumbing issue in our initial rooms the hotel has a unique design which we highly enjoyed and the extra attention to details was a nice touch welcome notes upon arrival funny messages on toiletries etc the rooms were very clean beds were comfy the bathrooms were spacious and the showers had good water pressure would recommend this hotel to others
