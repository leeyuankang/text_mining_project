great lobby and warm staff welcome also they were able to accommodate my early check in request i liked how there s water available on arrival the location is fantastic just steps from duomo and park hyatt the room was comfortable and clean there was no view from my room but it was ok as i was only sleeping there the toiletry packaging is cute i would definitely stay here again and found the service much better than the boscolo which i had stayed at another time
