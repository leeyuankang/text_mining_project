we loved the modern contemporary twist that this hotel has right down to the fabulously positive vibrant and helpful staff everything had an ease about it whilst i was checking in another staff member was asking my daughter what we were interested in and in minutes had a map and highlighter and was noting great places to eat and shop that were a little treasures everything and every need has been address and supplied in a beautifully designed manner the location is simply amazing our only regret is we only had one night we would recommend highly and will be returning for a longer stay we will definitely look for this hotel in other cities thank you
