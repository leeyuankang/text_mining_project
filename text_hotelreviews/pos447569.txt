i booked this hotel because it has great reviews from the guest and i wasn t mistaken when i chose to book the hotel after the quick check in at the reception area we went to our room and i was really surprised with a huge and beautifully designed room the bathroom is so big and everything is so nice this is really perfect that i took photos of each corner of the room the location is perfect as it is very close to duomo cathedral
