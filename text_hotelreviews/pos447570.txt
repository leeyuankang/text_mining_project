beautiful design rooms bathrooms hallways foyer everything is just really cool true milan style friendly and helpful staff excellent value for money location is very central right next to duomo but it is of course very touristy some will appreciate it i did not care for it so much but chose the hotel mostly because of the design of the hotel and was not disappointed to say the least overall excellent choice especially if in milan for a short visit and need to be in the center of it
