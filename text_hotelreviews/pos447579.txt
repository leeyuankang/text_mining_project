location is very central and easily accessible near to all shopping areas all staff were super nice and friendly they even helped to arrange an express laundry for my jacket although it was already passed the cut off time they offered free portable wifi for used in town area room is new and spacious clean with unique design amenities were always replenished every day just beware for family with young children many corners in the room are sharp due to metal edges other than that everything is perfect
