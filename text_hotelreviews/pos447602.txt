staff were the most helpful group of people i had ever come across nothing was too much trouble they booked train tickets for us printed ferry timetables recommended excellent restaurants for us and they were all friendly with great senses of humour so lovely the hotel was incredible i would recommend it to anyone staying in milan we stayed one night and it was right in the middle of the action we had very little time and we were able to eat well do lots of shopping and get to the train station easily for our next trip to bellagio it could not have been better
