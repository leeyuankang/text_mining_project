loved staying here not only are the rooms nice and spacious for the cost but the best part of this hotel is the amazing people that work there everyone was just amazing and helpful the hotel is also in an amazing location whilst the hotel does not have room service they always allowed us to raid the breakfast room for yoghurt or fruit for our little boy
