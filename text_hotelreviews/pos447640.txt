i stayed at this property for days couldn t ask for a better value of my money perfect location the piazza del duomo is just right at the corner the shopping district is within a min walking distance cozy colorful reception make you feel at home super friendly and helpful staff very smooth check in check out my room was spacious modern and trendy with a nice view the breakfast was good though i was not able to enjoy it due to my early busy schedule i highly recommend this boutique hotel and would definitely book it for my next stay in milan
