that was definitely one of the best hotels we stayed in italian and french riviera after glamorous negresco in nice and bristol in genova that one was really nice and comfortable everything is new and clean the guests can have breakfast even till so it s nice for the people who don t like to wake up early the hotel is situated in the very heart of milan so all the main attractions aren t more than minutes away you can t definitely find a better place to stay if you want to explore the city the staff is very friendly helpful and super attentive thank you guys for your help it was a pleasure to stay with you
