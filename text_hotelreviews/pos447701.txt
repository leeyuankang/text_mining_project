excellent location just minutes from duomo you feel really good at the first minute you enter the hotel met by very kind smiling and friendly people nicely designed large rooms comfortable beds nice breakfast they even give you a device you connect your phone so that you can use wi fi when you are going around the city very new hotel hope they never change their style i would love to stay there again
