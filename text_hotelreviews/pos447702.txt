this was such a great hotel i know this chain of hotels as it is a spanish one first and foremost the staff were beyond polite and were just brilliant i hope this service keeps up as the hotel had just opened and i suppose they are new and motivated the location is perfect right next to attached almost to the gallery and the cathedral the rooms are great too i would have loved to see more of milan but i was there for work to conclude highly recommended
