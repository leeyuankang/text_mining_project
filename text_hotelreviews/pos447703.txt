location was outstanding in a little lane just off the northwest corner of the duomo plaza steps out of your front door is the breathtaking sight of the duomo eclectic decor was fun not stuffy like a chain hotel scrupulously clean with friendly attentive staff excellent breakfast selection until midday for late risers da ponti restaurant across the road was a popular choice for locals and tourists alike and very handy for quick lunches and dinners will be my hotel of choice from now on would like to say that noise from the street in the mornings is unavoidable when staying centrally excellent location more than makes up for seconds of rubbish collection racket
