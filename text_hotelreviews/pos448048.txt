the nearest metro station is right next door as well as a super market and a pharmacy the breakfast wasn t that generous but it had everything needed it was fresh and the food didn t run out so i count it a good breakfast our room was very nice and clean free wifi everywhere in the hotel i d definately book this hotel again for the same price it was some sort of secret offer for members
