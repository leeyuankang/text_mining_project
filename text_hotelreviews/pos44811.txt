i was very fortunate when i checked in to be upgraded to a deluxe room which was a great way to end the last few days of a combined work and holiday trip the chamberlain is fantastic i had to stay at a supposed star hotel around the corner and the chamberlain is definitely far superior the room was great and had plenty of space fantastic bathroom with an amazing shower comfortable bed with power outlets right beside the bed including usb plugs to top it all off though is breakfast not a buffet of congealed eggs bacon and beans but being able to order off a menu there is a small buffet but that is for fruit pastries juice and cereals the other part i loved about the hotel is that all the staff are so friendly and helpful and look happy to be working there even through it is in the city and near bars and restaurants it is very quiet and they have blackout curtains so you can have a great sleep in if you need it you also get two free beers in the fridge or cider if you ask each day of your stay along with a bottle of still and sparkling water and fresh milk to make a coffee in your nespresso coffee machine it s also close to transport and the tower of london i will definitely stay at the chamberlain again and am also trying to get it included as somewhere to stay for corporate travel instead of the other hotel we have to use
