this is a beautiful old hotel really well situated to get to everything very easily the staff are generally very friendly and helpful however one of the front desk staff gave me the wrong information she had even checked with a colleague as she seemed unsure still got it wrong so i ended up missing a tour as i was waiting in the wrong place and when i finally got to the meeting point the tour had left and of course no refund this was disappointing but the only blot on an otherwise outstanding property
