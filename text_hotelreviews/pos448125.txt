this hotel was one of the nicest we have ever stayed in the staff was very friendly and helpful they provided many little things not available in other hotels but that added pleasure to our stay the lobby and bar area are extremely attractive and significantly changed weekly with fresh flowers and plants the rooms are small but very nicely decorated each room is different and comfortable there is no restaurant but the bar has a very good bar menu the location is perfect right on a canal we were able to walk everywhere and never took public transportation we would highly recommend this hotel
