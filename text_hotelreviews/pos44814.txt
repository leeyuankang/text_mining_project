the location was brilliant and the room was bigger then i expected the food was delicious especially the ale soaked sticky toffee pudding and i loved the fact that breakfast was chosen from a menu instead of a buffet as is common in most hotels now also i requested an early check in and my room was ready when i arrived the staff were wonderful and i received a lovely welcome
