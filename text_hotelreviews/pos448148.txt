the hotel was terrific the staff was super nice and helpful the location is great in the old part of amsterdam and close to all the sights but outside of the very noisy busy area near the central station the hotel itself has a beautiful decor in the public rooms complemented by always available tea coffee cookies and chocolate our room was a canal view room with a king size extremely comfortable bed the room felt spacious with a small sitting area with two comfortable modern white leather chairs on that side of the hotel there is light streaming in almost all day and the view of the canal with boat and pedestrian traffic is nice the bathroom was very small but well designed bright and adequate
