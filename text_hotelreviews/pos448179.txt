great location within easy walking distance of shops restaurants cafes and some of the popular sights stylish bedrooms we stayed in a classic the cheapest rooms but were pleasantly surprised at good size room which was stylishly decorated ensuite bathroom had bath with shower over the top but was powerful enough loved the free ipads given on arrival which you could use to look up and plan activities tours and sightseeing within a stones throw of some of the prettiest smaller canals close to jordan district great for strolling in the evenings
