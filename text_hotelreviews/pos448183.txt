hotel room was lovely very large comfortable beds and great view the free beverages and snacks in the lobby were a nice touch the bar service was good the bar lounge area was pleasant and relaxing to sit in i liked the authentic old dutch feel of the hotel and think this was preferable to a chain hotel the location was very central
