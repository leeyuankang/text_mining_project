the bed and the pillows were very comfortable we had a very sound sleep the whole decor of the room was done in the delft blue tones and print the toiletries were l occitance as we were there only for a day and wanted to make the most of our time experiencing amsterdam we were not able to explore the hotel facilities fully but the dining area bar library all looked very inviting the staff was polite and made us feel quite welcome location was superb walking distance from jordan centraal station de wallen and right in the midst of lovely canals would love to stay there again if given the opportunity of another visit
