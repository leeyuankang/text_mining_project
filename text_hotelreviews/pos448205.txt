the hotel was beautifully decorated and staff very friendly and helpful the complimentary drinks they provide near the main lobby were a fantastic resource after a long day exploring the city they had a good buffet selection for breakfast and the beds were super comfy hotel was also very centrally located and within easy walking distance to most major attractions in amsterdam the hotel also offer a taxi voucher that you can purchase for your ride back to the airport it is only slightly cheaper but still good to know
