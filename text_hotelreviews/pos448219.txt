if you wish to avoid the assembly line look and service of a multi chain hotel group this is a wonderful hotel with a personal touch beautiful decor and wonderful location the free beverages and high quality sweet treats are welcoming and we enjoyed ending our day with a cup of hot cocoa in the well appointed hotel lobby
