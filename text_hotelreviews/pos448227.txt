the room was beautiful with a view over the canal very clean with added bonuses such as dressing gown all toiletries etc the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful if you have a sweet tooth lots of free sweets and on tap hr complimentary coffee and great cookies all major attractions within walking distance or an easy tram ride away and being able to get your tickets at reception saves a great deal of queuing old world charm but modern facilities i would highly recommend
