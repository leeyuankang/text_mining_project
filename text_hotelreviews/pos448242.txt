the hotel is lovely in a perfect spot overlooking the canal singel near the flower market there is a canal cruise that leaves from right outside the front door the room was small but very pretty and the bed was very comfortable bathroom was perfect with big bath separate shower and a separate loo so loads of space breakfast buffet was very nice with loads of choice of hot and cold food there was a tea coffee machine to help yourself all day along with pastries and cake we didnt eat dinner in the hotel but there were plenty of restaurants nearby it was the perfect hotel for a night or two in amsterdam
