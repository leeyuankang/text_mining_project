the hotel is like being in a beautifully maintained home the decoration throughout is stunning and has a feeling of luxury wherever you are either in your room the bar area or the reception the bed was one of the most comfortable beds ever although the room was a little small it was beautifully clean with the lights and lamps sparkling and not a speck of dust toiletries provided amazing and hair dryer and towels just like home having complementary coffee and cakes in the lounge area was lovely after a busy day in amsterdam stayed for nights enjoyed breakfast both mornings which was plentiful and very tasty staff all extremely pleasant and helpful booked us a table at a local restaurant after recommendation was clear when we got there that without the hotel making the booking we wouldn t have secured table would definitely stay again
