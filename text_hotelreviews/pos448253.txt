great location centralized to many of the places to check out in amsterdam breakfast buffet had a pretty good selection and tasted great room with view of the canal is extra cost but nice in the bar area they have a small selection of pastries and a espresso coffee machine for guests to use the pastries were tasty and the cappuccinos the machine makes are better than what you usually get from the coffee shops in the us
