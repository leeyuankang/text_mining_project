we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was very nice of them since the upgrade was free of charge the room was really well decorated and spacious facing the canal the view was picturesque everything was lovely the staff was nice friendly and helpful the location is also worth mentioning it seems that all the main attractions were just a hasteless min walk away there was strong wi fi reception and there were two coffee machines on the ground floor so you can have free coffee whenever you like sometimes even with cookies and pastries we really enjoyed our stay and when i am in amsterdam again i am definitely staying at estherea
