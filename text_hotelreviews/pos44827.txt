good location just around the corner from tower hill and one of the major hop on hop off stops we had a balcony room which was great it wasn t the best weather so maybe a parasol would have been useful room was clean free drinks in the minibar and snacks were nice bar area was really nice and if you sign up to fullers email you get a free drink voucher reception staff were some of the nicest ones i ve ever met would go back again
