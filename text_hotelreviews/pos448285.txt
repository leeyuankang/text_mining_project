the hotel was close to amsterdam city centre which was great the staff were welcoming and proffessional the rooms were outstanding and the bed was so comfy we didn t want to get out of it even though we didnt eat in the hotel they provided complimentary drinks with cake which was nice overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone worth every single penny
