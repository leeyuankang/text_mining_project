this is a really lovely hotel and even though we loved amsterdam i always looked forward to coming back to the cosiness of the estherea the staff were probably the friendliest and most welcoming of any hotel i have stayed in and the never ending supply of complimentary hot drinks and cakes in the lounge area was a lovely touch i can t wait to stay here again
