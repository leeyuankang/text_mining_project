great location walking distance to everywhere no need to use public transport from airport get the train to amsterdam central w and walk using google maps also less than to main shopping area and dam square to anne frank s house to musmuem quarter lots of lovely restaurants close by would definately recommend cau restaurant if you like a good steak which you can book online so very handy cocktails were fab and the free coffee hot chocolate sweets cake in hotel was a nice free addition especially coming in from a busy day walking around this beautiful city
