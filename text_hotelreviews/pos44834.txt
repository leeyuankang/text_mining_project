excellent location inbetween of three underground stations minute walk to tower bridge small but nice room good value for money excellent renovated bathroom very nice staff and several amenities in the room make you feel welcomed they do have a bar which is open late for guests but not for outside people in addition several nice places are located within a few meters walking distance can certainly recommend for staying
