being upgraded to a room with the roof terrace with cake and bubbly to celebrate our wedding anniversary and a really comfy bed fantastic friendly staff nothing was too much trouble free extras in the room biscuits water fresh milk beers and fudge were much appreciated air con was a bonus especially as we were there during the heatwave great location especially for evenings with bars restaurants and the river near by
