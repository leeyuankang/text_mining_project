we love this charming hotel and have stayed here three times now the decor is sumptuous and cozy the rooms are certainly not minimalist there are flower patterns cushions and quirky chandeliers the bathroom is great and equipped with l occitane products there is always something sweet to welcome you back to the hotel during the day usually a lovely apple pie and hot coffee or tea the bar is a place to wear your best dress and shoes before changing into flats to walk along the cobbles to one of the many nearby restaurants
