this hotel was everything all the good reviews say we chose this hotel because it got such good reviews and we are glad we did the staff are very friendly and helpful take their recommendations for restaurants we went to three of their recommended establishments and really enjoyed them all well done our room was beautiful with lovely l occitane bathroom products there is free tea coffee hot chocolate and various cakes available during the day for when you pop back to drop off shopping the location is really near the more interesting boutique shops if your a cyclist rapha is only away it took us less than fifteen minutes to walk with our suitcase from the station along singel to our hotel in fact everything is within walking distance come to think of it all the big chain stores are very close too but the other way if you re into those shops we are definitely staying here again
