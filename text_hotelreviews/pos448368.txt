the hotel is is brilliantly located couldn t be more central and there are loads of great restaurants and cafes nearby the main shopping street is minutes stroll away the service is fantastic and everything is very luxurious the room was great and the bed large and comfy we loved the free coffee downstairs and there are cakes etc too the rooms were very quiet breakfast was excellent there is no room service or restaurant which was fine as their are any number of restaurants very close by
