great location about blocks to the kalverstraat shopping street lots of little shops in the alley with bakeries etc lots of restaurants in the road behind the property they were so sweet they upgraded us to a suite in the ground floor when i informed them that my mom was using a wheel chair it was very convenient that we didn t need to use the elevators there was free coffee all day and free snacks pastries for afternoon tea their staff are all very friendly and willing to help with everything it was nice having the canal right in front of the hotel and really feeling amsterdam we loved the hotel and hope to come back again
