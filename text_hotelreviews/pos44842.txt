we got a great deal on a last minute booking the room was spacious with a comfortable bed and separate bathtub shower in the bathroom oh and the contents of the minibar were included in the room rate the staff were very understanding about us being slightly late checking out best of all we were lucky enough to get a top floor room with a roof balcony so we ordered a huge breakfast to our room and ate outside in the sunshine
