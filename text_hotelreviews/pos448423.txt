the room was so gorgeously decorated and the beds comfortable the hotel was absolutely spotless we saw staff cleaning constantly this was a beautiful charming hotel the staff went above and beyond my daughter came down with a fever on the last day and i requested a later check out they not only accommodated us but asked whether she needed any medicine which i did not as i always travel with some but i think they would ve even helped with that so thankful
