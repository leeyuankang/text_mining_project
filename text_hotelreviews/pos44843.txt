loved this place so much that i am going back next time i am in london ok not super cheap but then again this is london and i have been to some seriously run down places paying this rate or more the room was beautiful the bed extra comfy and the breakfast brilliant you get a lots of freebies in the room including beer and nespresso coffee furthermore because it s a property owned by fuller s there s a pub on the ground floor with a very nice menu and interesting and diverse patrons
