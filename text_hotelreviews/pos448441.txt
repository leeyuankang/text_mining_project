loved the eccentricity and cultured beauty of the hotel the lobby area is large and very well decorated there is a library bar area and several sitting rooms this is not only delightfully encouraging for guests to interact but makes guest feel like they are not confined to their rooms for their stay hotels seem to miss the importance of this today having a well made cocktail at the bar was a highlight so nice that there is free coffee tea water and sweets available as this also encourages guests to interact and share experiences the hotel location is fabulous there are small restaurants literally next door italian greek traditional bakery conditorei and in the cheese shop a care deli and on the street over a large selection of cafes and restaurants basic cafes to full service restaurants so here s the interesting part of our visit we drove from germany and parked in the hotel parking garage but left a light on in our car so had a drained dead battery upon departure the hotel staff couldn t have been nicer or more attentive even though i was impatient and stressed alles gutes safely home in germany a later drive than anticipated but no fault or complaint to the hotel esterea staff so next time we ll fly or train to amsterdam and definitely stay again
