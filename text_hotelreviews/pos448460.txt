the staff were fabulous always attentive ready to help booked tours taxis carried luggage made us laugh and eased all our travel pressures would have stayed longer if they were not fully booked the location is excellent and the staff are helpful with suggestions for meals and directions to wherever we needed felt very safe property was very clean nice breakfast buffet and the hour coffee and juice in the lobby was a wonderful treat that made it feel like home would stay there again and again
