big room very comfortable and clean the bahtroom was also quite big offering both a shower and bathtub the location is great close to the tower bridge london tower and also close to two metro stops made getting around very easy everything in the minibar was complimentary so that was a nice touch we really didn t miss anything for our long weekend stay
