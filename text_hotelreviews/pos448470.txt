staff were lovely very friendly the way they presented themselves politely professionally but also had a giggle with the customers especially the evening nightshift making us feel very comfortable and relaxed staff had very good communication skills and customer relations all hotel staff appeared to work together as a team obviously the management care about staff and look after them which gives the impression of the hotel having a warm caring and friendly atmosphere room was very clean bed excellent so comfortable to be honest we did find the rooms very expensive especially when our flight was cancelled for hours we telephoned the hotel from the airport as soon as we were informed but they still charged us for the room on the night we missed with the city charges added even though the cancellation was through no fault of ours when we tried to book for an extra night they requested euros on the telephone then when i asked them to confirm by email they requested euros this was very disappointing but we did actually managed to book the same room through expedia for euros we have stayed in many star hotels around the world and would like to say thank you to the staff it was very nice that they took time to have conversations with customers as well as carrying out their work to high standards scotland september
