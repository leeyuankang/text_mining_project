we loved the estherea hotel staff are incredibly helpful friendly and courteous we had the room in the roof sort of so it was different and v friendly not the usual hotel room a trifle too small the bed cramped against the wall on one side but full of character and imaginatively furnished very cosy bed and pillows the lounge and bar areas are very well arranged and sumptuously fitted out and decorated
