wonderful hotel beautifully decorated and in a great location so many restaurants and cafes nearby right next to the streets shopping areas which was also a plus we could also walk to all the major museums truly felt as though we were in a magical little place we loved how unique the hotel felt as compared to larger hotels our room faced the street which was not loud at all at least compared to nyc would certainly recommend note we are in our mid twenties and the rest of the guests seemed much older than us by a decade or two we didn t mind at all but something to consider if you are looking for a younger hotel
