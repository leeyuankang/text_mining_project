we had a spacious and very comfortable room with an interesting street view the coffee station in the lobby with fresh biscuits was great the breakfast was also very good and you could always take a banana or apple with you for a snack the location of the hotel was excellent within walking distance to most of the tourist attractions and with lots of restaurants close by to choose from also close to a tram station loved the fresh flowers in the public areas
