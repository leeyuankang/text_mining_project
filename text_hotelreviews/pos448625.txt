i liked the location the hotel is a formal old fashioned style like south carolina or savannah georgia it has old world charm that is sophisticated and cozy the staff was wonderful and helped us park our car and move luggage there s a cozy bar that provided a beer and nosh while the car was parked there is a real nice british type breakfast and a coffee bar that provided coffee any time rooms with views of the canal are available
