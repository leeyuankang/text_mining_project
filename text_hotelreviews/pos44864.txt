location good near tower of london hotel with traditional pub underneath which we came back to after a meal friendly helpful staff comfortable room no noise and the breakfast was good plenty of choice in hindsight went to thai restaurant just a few doors away it was ok nothing more i wished i stayed at hotel and had what they had to offer instead if visiting london i would definitely use this hotel again
