we loved everything about this unique family owned hotel from the opulent furnishings to the cosy welcoming atmosphere the staff are very friendly and nothing appears to be too much trouble the hotel is spotlessly clean and has a lovely lounge bar area with free coffee tea available would definitely recommend this hotel which is well located for sight seeing
