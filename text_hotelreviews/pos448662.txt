the hotel was in a lovely setting right in the heart of amsterdam so we were able to go on foot everywhere the staff were warm and welcoming we loved the cocktail bar really expert cocktail maker and great bar snacks chips with apple sauce who knew that could be so delicious very plush decor with a warm family feel at it s heart we d def visit again
