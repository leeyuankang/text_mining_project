great location in the centre of amsterdam with most of main sights only a walk or short tram ride away the hotel is small but beautiful it is located right on a canal and each of the rooms are beautifully decorated the staff were also super friendly and very accommodating i stayed with my mom and were upgraded to a deluxe room which had a nice sitting area the rooms and lobby were just like the photos there is a great attention to detail with access to juice water coffee and tea with some biscuits in the charming lobby there is wifi throughout and the reception also provides you with an ipad for your personal use during your stay the ipad is also loaded with lots of helpful information and good restaurant recommendations hotel is immaculately cleaned daily and the luxury cosmetics from l occitance are a nice touch would highly recommend and would definitely stay again
