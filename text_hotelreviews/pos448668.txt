the staff were professional and friendly the bed was super comfy and we loved the bathroom and the provided soaps and shampoos the entrance of the hotel and adjoining rooms are great for relaxing when you come back from a busy day my daughter gives two thumbs up for the tea and cake provided free every day we will be back as it was also the perfect location for a stay in the city
