the bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in in an hotel and the pillows were terrific the location is great quiet but with all main attractions no more than miles away and for non walkers there is a good tram service good eateries locally esp liked vasso italian restaurant and o reilly s irish pub for the best triple cooked chips anywhere
