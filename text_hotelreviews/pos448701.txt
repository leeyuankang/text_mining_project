i emailed the hotel to tell them were there to celebrate my husband s and we were upgraded which was lovely our friends rooms were just as nice though and all slightly different breakfast was great the staff were really helpful and friendly there was a bit of maintenance work going on in the bar when we arrived but the staff served us drinks in the lounge area and recommended a lovely bottle of wine i would definitely stay here again
