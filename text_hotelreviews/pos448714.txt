this was a lovely quirky hotel that had a nice homely vibe to it all rooms are different we stayed in room and it was beautiful the hotel is in a very central position and is suitable for families and couples the central train station is only a minute walk away and dam square is within a stones throw the staff were very friendly our credit card was charged twice by the hotel in error but once we brought it to their attention they immediately apologised and resolved it within hours very impressed with everything here and will be back
