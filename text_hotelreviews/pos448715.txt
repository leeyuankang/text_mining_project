a very welcoming hotel great warming atmosphere very friendly and helpful staff clean rooms with comfy bed and pillows rooms a bit on the small side but lovely and cozy only downside was bathroom a bit too small so we struggled finding space for our toiletries saying that though they did provide nice soap shampoo etc didn t try their breakfast or bar but looked good loved the complimentary coffee pastries and chocolates paid extra for canal view but quite high up so view wasn t great so wouldn t bother with the view room personally would definitely stay again and recommend very enjoyable stay
