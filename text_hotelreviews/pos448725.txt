everything was lovely the room was beautiful it was tucked away in the middle of the building with no view but that didn t matter because it was gorgeous cosy and warm extremely clean and incredibly comfortable our room had a separate walk in wet room which i particularly liked even the key fob was beautiful the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful on arrival we were given an ipad to use during our stay and the wifi in the hotel was excellent free tea coffee sweets and cakes in the reception area and two complimentary bottles of water in the mini bar each day of our stay i can t comment on breakfast as we decided to eat brunch out so didn t try it located centrally but not on a busy street and within easy walking of all the main museums attractions and the train station next time i go to amsterdam i won t even bother looking at other hotels
