the location of this hotel is premium and the decor of the hotel is just so inviting the hotel offers free coffee tea lemonade and small snacks we stayed over christmas and they made a brilliant mulled wine and housekeeping left us a gift of l occitane lotions and chocolates in our room which was such a nice gesture overall the staff was very helpful and pleasant
