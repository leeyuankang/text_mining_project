i really enjoyed my stay and strongly recommend it the staff was very kind and gave me all the attention i needed i look forward to staying there again the great is that the next time i travel to amsterdam i will not have to search for hotels tremendous breakfast which is worth every euro some might complain about the room size it didnt bother me at all though excellent pick
