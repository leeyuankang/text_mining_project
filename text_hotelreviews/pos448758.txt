most beautiful hotel room i have ever seen felt like royalty we didn t prebook but upon arrival we were given a beautiful canal facing room was a bit concerned about how the wifi will be due to past reviews but it worked excellently the amenities provided upgraded our stay hugely and are that extra touch to make you feel truly spoiled the ipad recieved upon arrival the coffee and tea station there are deserts some times too etc there is a hour gym it isn t big but it does it s job tv has english channels would highly recommend this hotel note that price doesn t not include city tax
