this hotel is one of the best i have ever stayed in friendly attentive staff beautifully decorated not overdone very personal if you like a plush style great cocktails impeccable room service comfortable high quality bed etc we had the good fortune of a free upgrade for which we were very grateful the class of the house is also shown in the fact that nobody made a fuss about the upgrade they did not announce it in a very important voice saying we can offer you today a free upgrade to one of our best rooms or something equally silly which always leaves a bad taste in my mouth they just smilingly inquired next morning whether we had liked our room really high class
