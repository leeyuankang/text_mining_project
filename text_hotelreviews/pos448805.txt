a rarity amongst hotels it looked as good in real life as it does in its pictures very comfortable and full of thoughtful touches for example instead of the usual mini bottle of shampoo in the shower there was a large shampoo a large conditioner and a large hair repairer there were free tea and coffee with mini cakes and biscuits hours a day there was even a large glass container of iced mint leaves for those who like mint tea oh and jars of sweets too the bedrooms are all individually designed and lack nothing the staff were constantly attentive and cheerful and nothing was too much trouble the breakfast choice was very extensive the best we have come across in our four years of travelling europe and the scrambled eggs were constantly replenished so that they were always fresh and never past their best as so often happens if you get to breakfast late breakfast was available until another plus point downsides per hour for parking but still cheaper than street parking the only thing that could improve the hotel would be a large open fire blazing away
