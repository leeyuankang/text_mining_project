fabulous hotel easily one of the best i have stayed in me and my wife were given a upgrade with a room with a rooftop terrace which was unexpected we also had a mini fridge with complimentary beers water and milk that was a real nice touch the hotel lobby and pub had a real rustic feel but the room was very modern with everything you expect and more the location is fantastic as well and it is so easy to get to all the main tourist attractions it is right by the skygarden which was great as we planned to spend our ssturday night there also thrre is a dlr line a minute walk away that was perfect as we were going to see s concert in the on sunday we also had breakfast included and this was also of a very high standard so overall this was a fantastic experience and i would definitely look to stay in this hotel again the next time i visit london
