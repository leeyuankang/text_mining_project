this hotel far exceeded my expectations and will most certainly be my go to hotel for all future stays in amsterdam while my single room was small it was beautifully and uniquely decorated and i felt pampered by the high end bath products and elegant details i could have spent all day in the comfortable lobby drinking delicious mochas from the espresso machine and had a hard time dragging myself out into the dreary weather to explore the city highly highly recommend especially with a booking com discount
