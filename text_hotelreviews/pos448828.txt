beautiful hotel and staff when we go back we will definitely be staying in this hotel again it seems pricey for breakfast so we didn t have but when we went out first day for breakfast we ended up spending a lot more money so for the other two days we had it in the hotel and it was the nicest breakfast i have had at a hotel with plenty of choice if you are debating what hotel go to then this is your best bet easy and beautiful location definitely give it
