the hotel is perfectly located just near the jordaan and many other interesting spots of amsterdam the next tram stop can be reached within a minute walk and the central train station only tram stops away the hotel staff is very friendly and attentive we were lucky to get a room with view on the beautyful canal the room was spacious and had a lovely decor with nice details the beds are comfortable and the bathroom facilities clean and modern although the building is old the rooms are quiet this was our second time at this hotel and we will come back for sure
