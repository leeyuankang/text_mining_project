the bathroom was really spacious i know that sounds like a strange thing to say but as someone who has stayed at a lot of hotels and a fair few in london i wasn t really expecting such a good sized bathroom they re usually a glorified cupboard even when they re nice and they do the job the room was already good for the price in london
