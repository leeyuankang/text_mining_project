the decor was so charming in every room each room has a different theme color but both of ours both the adults and teens had separate rooms were impeccable clean and fresh no mildew smell no worries about old dusty or dirty carpet pillows or bedspreads windows open to let in the fresh air we faced a street not canal and thought we weren t missing a thing the staff was friendly and helpful on sight breakfast was very convenient and tasty rooms and bath were well appointed and fairly roomy for a boutique european hotel would definitely go back it added to the charm of amsterdam
