the room was very nicely appointed they paid attention to small details like a soft close toilet seat the hotel has a very cozy feeling with classic wood trim and old photographs and engravings the hotel bar next door had fantastic staff thanks rob and laura and a solid menu location was great too just a short walk from two tube stations and the tower of london
