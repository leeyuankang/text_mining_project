location is great we were flying in and out of city airport and also had business at the excel center the hotel is about minutes from the dlr in addition the underground to tower hill is right there too so you can get to the central london areas really fast there are lots of pubs and restaurants around the area we arrived at so i asked if we could leave our bags and come back for check in this was easy to do and the front desk agent let us know that the room would be ready at if we wanted to wait she also offered coffee and tea we asked for a quiet room and we got a courtyard facing room on the floor the corner room was quite spacious and we loved the bottled water and fuller s beer we had complimentary breakfast which was also great cold item buffet along with a cooked selection of your choice the front desk gave us a coupon for pounds off of dinner but we didn t have time to try will next time for sure we will definitely be back on our next trip to london
