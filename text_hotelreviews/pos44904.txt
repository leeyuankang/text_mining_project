the room was so lovely and the bed and duvet were the most comfortable i have ever experienced i love the fact that everything in the minibar fridge is free what a generous and welcoming treat the whole feel of the hotel was very cozy and not like a boring commercial marriott at all the food in the pub was also delicious and the serving staff excellent
