we travelled as a group of for a hen weekend the staff were accommodating from the moment we arrived and were able to check us into one of our rooms an hour early so we could drop our bags and go to the first activity we had booked the rooms were lovely and clean and the beds were comfortable the shower was fantastic the cooked breakfast in the morning was delicious it was all brought out at the same time even though we all ordered different things off the menu the staff were attentive and would bring top up of tea coffee and toast the location worked perfectly for us being a short walk away from tower hill station and all the activities we had booked brilliant value for money it exceeded our expectations
