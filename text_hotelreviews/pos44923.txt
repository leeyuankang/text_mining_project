the hotel was exactly as advertised regarding the room we booked i e not a photo of one room and then shoved in a box room the staff were all brilliant and friendly one recent review on trip advisor criticised the breakfast this is a hotel pub not a swanky restaurant everything was well cooked plentiful and good quality we will definitely return
