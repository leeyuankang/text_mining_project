the hotel was stunning from the moment we walked in which was around am the staff was extremely friendly the hotel was very clean especially the room and the food was stunning particularly the breakfast everything was perfect and when i return to london which i do every year i would not stay at any other place ever again plus i received a voucher for a complimentary drink which was really kind of the hotel and the fact that they don t feel like one of those large chain brand hotels but had a cosy british feel to it tops it off the location is great so central to everything best time i had so far in london
