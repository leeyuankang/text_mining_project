although not big the room was lovely and nicely decorated with a traditional but quality feel about the place staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for us the bed was very comfortable and location was nice and quiet the cooked breakfast was excellent and breakfast menu choice fantastic the location for central london and the theatre s and museums isn t great as its two changes on the tube but for the tower and greenwich it couldn t be better we used the river clipper service from tower pier to get about which is a short walk away we will definitely stay here again
