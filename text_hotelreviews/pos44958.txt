this hotel was in a great location between main subway stations the bus stop and also by the tower bridge and the boat station but this hotel was so special because of the wonderful staff max rebecca sarah annya and chris all helped to make my first time to london an extra special trip for me helping me with information and service above and beyond and always so warm and friendly the rooms were wonderfully decorated and extremely clean this hotel has a restaurant and bar attached very convenient and the food is excellent i would recommend this hotel to anyone and if i visit london again this is where i will stay i believe it is one of the top hotels in the world that i have stayed at just awesome
