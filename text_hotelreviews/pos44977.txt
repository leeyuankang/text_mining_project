the staff were very friendly and helpful the main lift was out of order however there was a service lift which was perfectly usable the management informed me about the lift as soon as i checked in and provided complimentary beers for the inconvenience the tube station is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel there s both a small tesco store as well as another store that sells sim cards drinks chips etc many good restaurants and cafes around the hotel enjoyed my stay there and would definitely stay there again
