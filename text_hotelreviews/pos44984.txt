very nice english breakfast at the hotel s restaurant this was some of the best black pudding i ever had free beer in the room s fridge was a nice touch too the reception had a selection of prepaid sims which was very convenient proximity to the liverpool station and hence to the stansted express was a definite plus too overall this was the most enjoyable stay i had in london for a long time
