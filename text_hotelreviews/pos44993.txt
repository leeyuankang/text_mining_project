great location steps away from the tower bridge super nice staff who checked us in earlier upgraded our room to deluxe double room and gave us two drinks for free in the hotel pub to compensate the inconvenience created by the renovation of the lift the room and showers were nice and clean breakfast was good we had english breakfast a la carte but also they had continental buffet we enjoyed it a lot
