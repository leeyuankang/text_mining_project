great location smack dab in the center of the city where it all happens off stephenplatz steps from the underground our room did not have a couch and instead it had a desk which was very helpful for doing work on the laptop our king bed was two twin beds put together with comfortable mattresses the room is pretty large for europe with hardwood floors and relatively large bathroom shower tub is narrow but manageable service is good and the continental breakfast included in the room rate is absolutely great the best breakfast i ve ever had in all my trips to europe a large buffet of meats cheese fruit bread dairy cereal juice and good coffee nights cost us euros a very good deal including breakfast the hotel has a working elevator and a safe and ac in the room our room is on the first floor which is really the floor for americans the location is absolutely dead center to everything you d want to see in vienna and you could walk everywhere if you wanted to
