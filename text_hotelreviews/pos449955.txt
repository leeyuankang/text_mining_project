stayed in this hotel for the last night all was great and surely nothing to complain about location couldn t be any better its just where grabenstrasse and k rntner strasse meet two of the main vienna streets our room was spotlessly clean just as all the hotel some people were writing about the room furnishing and saying its outdated well i look at it in a different way its the hotel characteristic just as it appears on the photos so surely whoever booked this hotel knew what the furniture looked like all staff from the front office the porter the chambermaids the restaurant staff etc were very friendly and although in a professional way they were always with an honest smile on their faces breakfast was also great and well organised surely worth staying there and if visiting vienna once again thats where i ll stay
