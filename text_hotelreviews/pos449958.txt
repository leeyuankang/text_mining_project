nothing bad to say about this hotel location amazing breakfast very good staff excellant hotel right in the square you walked out the door and you were in the centre of everything walking distance to many attractions from this location example opera house museums churches etc we used the subway from the train station very easy or stops from the station would stay here again and would highly recommend it
