we stayed at hotel royal in dec and after considering several possible alternatives we happily returned in jan the hotel is incredibly well located in the very heart of vienna and has access to the metro only metres away the room with living area and couch was comfortable and spacious with good storage the bathroom even has a bath the buffet breakfast offered a generous spread desk staff were efficient and helpful we arrived early and were given our room without an extra charge much appreciated after all night train travel
