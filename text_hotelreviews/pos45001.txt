we loved everything the staff were very friendly and welcoming the room was very clean and had lots of space though no drawers for clothes the bathroom was one of the nicest we ve ever been in with a great shower if a wee bit small a separate tub big fluffy towels the hotel provides a complimentary in house beer and water in the mini fridge which is replenished every day it s mid way between two tube stops aldgate and tower hill so is convenient to everywhere there s lots of restaurants around so you don t have to eat in the hotel restaurant but the food there is really good the triple cooked chips were addicting it s our new go to hotel for future visits to london
