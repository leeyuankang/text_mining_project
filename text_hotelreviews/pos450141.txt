the thing i liked the most is the service and the care of the staff as we stayed at the sloane square hotel with my baby everyone was extremely attentive and friendly also as our ba flight was delayed because of the global it glitch and we missed our first night at the hotel the management offered us a very late check out exceptionally to compensate for british airways fault and in addition to everything else when i realised that forgot something in the room upon my arrival home and called the hotel to check if they found the item they were extremely helpful aude at the reception in particular and searched everywhere and found it dear sloane square jotel crew thank you very much for your hospitality i will definitely stay with you in future
