small but nice and clean rooms the beds were a little hard the bar and the restaurant are nice in the evening food is good for a reasonable price staff is friendly and the cleaning staff does a good job close to the tube so a good connection to downtown london which is great for business and for visiting london good wifi connection which i really appreciate
