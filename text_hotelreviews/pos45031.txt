the hotel is very close to tower of london and in city of london dlstrict the staff was kind and helpful the rooms are large and baths are comfortable which is important for me the main lift did not work during our stay and management offered us free drinks in the pub located in the hotel a very kind gesture wifi is free and speed is good
