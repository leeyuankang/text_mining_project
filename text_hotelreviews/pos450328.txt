i couldn t fault this trip we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who asked us about our plans and then upgraded us to a club room as it was our aniversarry the room was amazing a massive bed wardrobe safe fridge and tv and a fantastic view of the square we also loved the modern bathroom the staff really made our trip enjoyable they treated us to a bottle of prossecco and a card followed by a bowl of cherries and hot chocolate their hospitality continued beyond this and made our stay extremely easy and comfortable deffinetly recommend the sloane hotel
