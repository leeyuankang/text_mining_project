good location but found staff rather miserable and not welcoming in the morning asked at reception if breakfast was included and was told it was only to be charged at check out and the same clerk denied saying it was included i ve stayed at quality hotels throughout europe with work and i regret to say i will not stay here again i have stayed at similar hotels in london many times and have not experienced staff like this the staff make a hotel not the rooms it s a shame that with such a great location they do not seem to get the customer service element
