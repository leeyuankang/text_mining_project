wonderful location close to everything the staff were friendly welcoming efficient and helpful real fire blazing in the spacious reception area with large comfy sofas and modern art on the walls my room was smallish but perfect with a great view onto sloane square the bed was very comfortable with nice sheets and magazines were supplied containing lots of information and maps for shopping and what s on in london bathroom was small but perfectly kitted out with lots of hot water a real advantage was being able to walk directly through an internal door in the hotel to the cote restaurant next door without having to go outside i thoroughly recommend eating there for price great atmosphere and quality of food the hotel is an old building which has been nicely renovated to modern day standards i will definitely stay there again on my next trip to london
