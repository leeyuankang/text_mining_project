having stayed at the hotel previously we requested a room on the top floor which we were given the breakfast that they offer on the floor is very good always fresh croissants etc the beds and pillows are very comfortable as sometimes in hotels the beds tend to dip in the middle not in this hotel the location is excellent plenty of restaurants in the area the underground is minutes walk away
