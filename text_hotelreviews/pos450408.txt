the location in sloane square is unbeatable and having cote restaurant next door is a great asset we liked the express breakfast in the first floor cafe and the foyer has been improved so that there is a nice waiting area there now we loved the little spot reading lights by the bed most hotels have very poor light for reading in bed liked the elemis toiletries
