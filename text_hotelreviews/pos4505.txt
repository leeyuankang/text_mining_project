great location nice area and near the tube station for piccadilly line beautiful and ornate building which stands out from the other hotels nearby we were celebrating my wife s birthday and the staff provided a great room wine and chocolates to welcome her good breakfast nice lounge bar no real facilities to mention such as gym or sauna but ideal for a weekend in london would definitely use again
