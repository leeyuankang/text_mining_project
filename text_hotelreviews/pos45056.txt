the room was really big for london s standards we were given a free upgrade as well as the location so handy to two tube stations it was close to cafes and restaurants staff were great with particular mention of chris a free drink was given to compensate for the main lift being repaired but that had no effect on our access to our room with the use of a second lift available restaurant menu provided a wide range for dinner highly recommend this hotel
