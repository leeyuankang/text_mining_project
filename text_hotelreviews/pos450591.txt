we stayed at this hotel for nights our stay was lovely and it was a nice hotel with clean rooms and good facilities we didn t have breakfast included but that wasn t an issue at all because of the many cafes situated outside the hotel as well as a supermarket just minutes away from where you could easily get breakfast groceries tea and coffee facilities were provided in the room the location was also good it wasn t exactly in the centre but the connections were super easy as the tram station is minutes away and it s a direct tram to centraal station which takes minutes we particularly liked this because it was quiet at night away from tourists so we got a good nights rest the staff was also very friendly and helpful would stay again
