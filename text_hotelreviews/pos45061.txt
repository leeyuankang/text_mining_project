the property was very nice everything looked new but still had an old world charm beautiful throughout the lobby bar restaurant and room the room was spacious and clean the bathroom in particular was amazing the location is only a short walk to the tower of london and the tower bridge however it is in a business district and many of the nearby restaurants seam to close on the weekend overall i would recommend this hotel for its beautiful facilities pleasant staff and good location
