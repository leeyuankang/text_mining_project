although it takes mins by tram to get to the hotel from the city centre this accomodation is a deal it is situated in a quiet area and we had a beautiful view from the window there was a pond with boats wifi was the fastest i have ever used the staff were very polite and friendly we were allowed to leave our bags in a baggage room after check out till late evening temperature in a room was a little bit cool but the hotel provides you with a warm blanket oh and they give you pillows per person even if it is an economy class room
