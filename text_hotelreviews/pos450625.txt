the bedroom was clean and very comfortable we were upgraded to a lovely standard room which was a nice touch there was not a sound at night so we had fantastic sleeps which is not always the case in a hotel one of the best bathrooms i have ever had in a hotel perfect shower from reception to the cleaning staff to the porter who looked after our luggage on the last day everyone was lovely
