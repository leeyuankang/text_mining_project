the room was a lovely size and really clean the beds were made up every day by the time we got back and new towels were put in the room if we needed them the shower in the room was honestly perfect i wish i could have taken it back with me transport links straight into the centre are about a five minute walk in each direction from the hotel the receptionists were always more than happy to help and knew a lot about the area transport links things to do the hotel is a bit further out but as i said it shouldn t be a problem when there are great public transport links outside a single ticket which you could use for up to an hour were but also a hour ticket was and you can use on the bus or the tram i did not find the location an inconvenience at all due to how effective everything else was the bus goes from schiphol airport straight to the hotel i would definitely recommend and stay at this hotel again
