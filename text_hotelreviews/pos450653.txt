the room and private bathroom were very clean and spacious the shower was fantastic great water pressure and large staff were friendly and helpful and our room was serviced each day with new towels tea and coffee and anything else we needed beds were comfortable the room itself was quite elegant the location was great multiple tram stops and bus stops leading to amsterdam centraal and dam square were essentially right on our doorstep staff also were helpful in providing travel cards to buy for the public transport which saved us the time and stress in working that out by ourselves we got a day travel card for the tram bus and train parks shops and food places were within short walking distance if you re up for a long walk the walk to amsterdam central area only takes about an hour and is a nice way to explore overall i enjoyed my stay and this hotel was amazing considering the price i will stay here again
