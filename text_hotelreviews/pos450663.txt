public transport was easy to get to the hotel from the airport you can either take the shuttle which is euro round trip if going with a group over people or take public transport the staff was helpful in telling us which tram or bus to take to go to the destinations we wanted to go while we were there there are a few restaurants around and a great hookah bar right behind the hotel
