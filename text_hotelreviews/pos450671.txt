i liked that the rooms were spacious and the bathtub was pretty large that s a luxury nowadays there is plenty of storage drawers closet space etc they also provide toiletries there s a boiler and a decent variety of coffee and tea in the room basically you will find everything you need in the room i got an awesome deal on my double room their prices are competitive for a star hotel you get your money s worth and more i think if this hotel fixes a couple of things it could easily become the best hotel in amsterdam
