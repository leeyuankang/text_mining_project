really lovely hotel clean and up to date clean everyday with fresh towels and toiletries which was a nice touch ordered room service the first night as we had a flight delay and too shattered to go out the service was superb and the waiter was extremely pleasant and helpful reception staff were very polite and cheerful will definitely be staying again
