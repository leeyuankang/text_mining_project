the staff were very reponsive when i approached them about an issue regarding the room service for so reason my contact lense case was discarded they gave us free breakfast for my troubles and also prvoided me a location where i could buy a new one the hotel room was fairly large and was very clean the location was outside the main city but very close to public transportation also there are nice jogging trails behind the hotel
