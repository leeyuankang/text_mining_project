i reluctantly booked this room as i knew it is not located in the heart of amsterdam but i was very glad i made this choice the tram is very close by so getting around was never a problem in addition it turned out that i felt ill by the time i got to amsterdam so i was able to rest comfortably in my room the hotel is very clean and comfy so i would definitely recommend it to other travellers
