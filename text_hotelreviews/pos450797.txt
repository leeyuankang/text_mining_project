the front desk staff were very hospitable and helpful the dinner in the hotel was pretty good my son had a burger with french fries it was prepared well the room we stayed in was huge it was enough to accommodate my family of four comfortably the location was great it was about meters to the tram and the bus the hotel sold tickets to get on public transportation as well as the museums the directions for taking public transportation was very clear we were able to get to places like the anne frank house dam square pancake house the hard rock cafe and the van gogh museum within minutes from the hotel i am picky about cleanliness and safety the overall cleanliness and safety were good the hotel was good i would classify it as a star instead of four stars for expectation management
