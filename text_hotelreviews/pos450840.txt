staffs are really helpful they provided maps of the city they also have the one day ticket for tram and bus to go around the city there s a supermarket nearby to buy sandwich snack and drinks although the hotel is a bit far from the city but when we go to the city center by bus and tram it ll go round the city just like a hop on hop off city tour
