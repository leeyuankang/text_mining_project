the staff at this hotel were friendly and welcoming it was refreshing to have waitresses at breakfast who were happy to actually chat to you the breakfast menu was excellent and it was lovely to have it cooked to order instead of the usual hot buffet arrangement the room was clean and comfortable and larger than many hotel rooms we ve had before in other london hotels and we will definitely pick it again
