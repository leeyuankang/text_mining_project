our stay at the chamberlain was perfect the staff was very helpful and friendly the hotel is very clean and comfortable the location is fantastic during our stay the main elevator was out of service but that didn t make much of a difference for us as the staff went out of their way to compensate for it the food at the hotel is delicious and it was great to enjoy a couple of beers at the pub we would definitely go back to this hotel on our next trip to london
