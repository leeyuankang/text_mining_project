the location and the access to the hotel by the underground is the best thing about the hotel the room was clean and we could adjust air conditioning although it was a bit noisy we recommend the room overlooking the inner yard you can mention it when doing your reservation the room was quiet even if we opened the window the staff at the reception were prompt and very polite too you can pay by all types of credit cards they have a locked storage room where you get your baggage labelled so it is safe as for the underground travel the best way is to buy one or more day tickets which allows you to use all public transport there is a nice cycling path close the hotel
