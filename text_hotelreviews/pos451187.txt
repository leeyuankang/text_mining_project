this is a very nice hotel it is located right next to a subway line which makes it easy to get down to old town yet because it is not located in old town it is in a quiet neighborhood the internet is fast but requires logging on frequently our room was modern and the shower was great the front staff seemed too rushed to help us with questions it would be nice if they knew something to help the tourists i would stay here again we arrived via the train station it is too far to walk but easy to get to via the subway the tube from the train station look for line and take it towards leopoldau the direction of the l name for two stops to karlsplatz change trains to in the direction of h tteldorf the direction of the h name not the he name for two stops and get off at pilgramgasse the hotel is across the street on the south exit easy use the to get into old town or the other direction to go to schr nbrunn castle we found it cheaper to get the hour transit card from the dispensers in the subway stations rather than the hour vienna tourist card we then got the sisi pass from the sch nbrunn castle or the imperial apartments for entry to three locations
