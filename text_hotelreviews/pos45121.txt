staff were very attentive from reception to the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised the lift was broken so we had to use the service lift a very minor inconvenience but they gave us a voucher for a free drink at the bar which was a nice touch impressed with the breakfast which had a lot of choice and hot breakfast was cooked fresh for us good value for money room was nice and clean very quiet we had a great night s sleep
