the location is perfect very easy to get to from the tube and only a minute walk to the tower of london and tower bridge for anyone doing the hop on hop off bus tours there is a pick up point just in front of the tower of london the hotel itself is simply beautiful staff were very friendly and helpful the food in the restaurant was lovely and the room was clean and beautifully designed we were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe king which we were delighted it also because the main elevator was under going maintainable the hotel kindly gave us both a complimentary drink of our choice from the bar to express their sincerest apology overall i was very impressed and would highly recommend the chamberlain hotel to anyone visiting london
