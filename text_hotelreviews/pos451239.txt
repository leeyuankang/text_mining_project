not a bad position close to the underground station and even to an certain extent within walk range of the center clean bathroom and premises nice historical building in good shape without any age inconveniences and with all modern facilities good wifi coverage lovely ambiance nice decorations room picture corresponds to reality except they look a bit bigger in pics maybe no major big unpleasant surprises
