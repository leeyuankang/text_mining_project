within walking distance of the vienna market which is interesting to walk through we had our best meal there also about a minute walk to the opera house the hotel is across the street from the metro station in a residential area we felt safe walking but a slightly rougher crowd by the mcdonalds a block away which is also where the the metro entrance is very convenient for taking the train out of vienna that station was about a minute walk the hotel itself is clean and comfortable when we arrived around noon our room wasn t ready so they offered us an upgrade very decent
