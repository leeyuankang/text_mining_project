the location exactly opposite an underground station is very very ideal it was also close mins walk to shops and supermarkets and i could quickly get my toiletries and snacks that i hadn t carried due to weight restrictions it was very easy to access with cars and it s only just train stops from vienna s city centre without the city centre price even though all these amenities are close by the area and hotel on a whole are quiet and pretty classy i ll surely use this hotel again and i ve already recommended it to friends the staff were very helpful polite and professional
