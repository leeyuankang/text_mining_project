the rooms were small but they had an extra bed as requested check in and check out was easy the staff could communicate in english and the location is absolutely brilliant just off the pilgramgasse u bahn station walk out of the hotel into the station made travelling from the airport cat to landstrasse line from there to pilgramgasse a piece of cake we were also able to extend our check out to rather than at without any issue or extra charge furthermore they kept our luggage in a locker from till we picked it up at pm the entire thing was seamless and stress free
