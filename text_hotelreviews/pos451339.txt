hotel location is good just next to a metro station which leads to downtown after a few stops also easy to reach from airport through also public transportation should you like walking or running like me around the town it would not take for you more than minutes to reach city centre through karl platz or museum quarter reception staff were very kind and helpful since the moment we have reached the hotel until we left they responded our needs in a practical manner rooms were very clean and the bed was so relaxed for a good sleep if you like to try different cuisines in vienna the naschmarkt market is just minutes walk away all in all i was quite satisfied for staying there and can recommend
