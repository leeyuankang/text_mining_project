upgraded on arrival to a room with a balcony on the fifth floor which in summer would be lovely as it had seating and loungers the staff were a treat always polite attentive and friendly being a fuller s hotel the beer on offer is to die for particularly for an expat like myself who does not have access to their wonderful brews when abroad very good breakfast choices limited dinner menu but good offerings all the same
