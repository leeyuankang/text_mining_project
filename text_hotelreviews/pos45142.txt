when we arrived early we could check in hours on before and we got a room upgrade the personnel was so friendly because there were maintenance works on the main elevator we had to go through another elevator and the hotel management offered us some free drinks at the bar because of that it was one of our best hotel experiences nice location if you want to do a jack the ripper tour
