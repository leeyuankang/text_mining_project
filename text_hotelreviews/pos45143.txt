lovely room comfy bed great shower and towels the nespresso coffee machine was a nice surprise breakfast was very tasty and good value for a tenner there was a fairly wide selection of continental and traditional english food and good coffee too which is becoming hard to find these days my second stay here and we would definitely go back again
