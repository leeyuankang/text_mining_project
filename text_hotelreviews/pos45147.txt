very helpful and friendly staff in the hotel and pub great service main lift was out of order so we each got to choose one drink from the pub as compensation although second lift right next to the pub was available our room was very cosy brand new and really clean with complimentary ale waters and selection of tea and nespresso tidiness was immaculate tower hill and aldgate stations just mins away thus perfect connection to all public transport lines
