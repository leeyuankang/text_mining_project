very modern and quiet we choose our hotel for its proximity to the main train station it is a little away from the main city centre but lots of transport and about a min walk travel tip make sure you get a public transport pass as the ticket box on the trams only take coin and we didnt have any the yellow bus is amazing and has different routes i wouldnt recommend paying the extra for a vienna pass as you will never be able to spend the time exploring each stop just choose and pay for the stops you want to do of the routes took hours without us getting off at any stops due to limited time wonderful overview of vienna if you only have a couple of day look out for the dedicated cycle paths everywhere throughout the city as they cycle with speed love the way everyone gets out into the parks with the warm start to summer
