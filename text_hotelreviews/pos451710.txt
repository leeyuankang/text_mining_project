we chose this hotel because of its proximity to the train station it s a brisk minute walk which allowed us to drop off our luggages and walk around freely the neighborhood itself is okay but there is a supermarket nearby although it closes really early and you can find places to shop within the train station belvedere palace is within walking distance and you can take the u bahn easily from the train station to get to other parts of vienna we really needed water one night but nothing was open but they had vending machines on every floor so crisis averted breakfast was not included for us so we paid euros each for two days of breakfast and it was well worth it great selection of ham cheeses bread pastries and salads overall very pleasant stay and the wifi was fast
