this was an excellent option for us as a family of four we have stayed in many four person rooms in city breaks across europe and this was one of the best plenty of space and very comfortable great shower lots of storage our boys are and and they enjoy playing this hotel has a courtyard in the middle which they could use for games and running around in general the hotel was modern and didn t have any tired looking furniture which you tend to find elsewhere the location of the hotel was good as well for us although a little away from the centre the centre was only a short metro ride away also next to the hotel you have a supermarket a bank and also one block away a pedestrianized zone with shops cafes etc the main train station is also only minutes walk away for trips out of vienna overall for a city break in europe for a family of four who don t want to spend five star prices on accommodation hotel zeitgeist cannot be faulted
