the hotel was located very close to the main rail station and access to public transport was excellent we liked the newly refurbished room it was clean and comfortable the air conditioning worked very well as it was hot during our stay the bed was extremely comfortable the staff could have been more friendly but apart from that we had an excellent stay and would definitely recommend this hotel
