the hotel is perfectly situated in the business district of east london hope i m right about this though it s very close to tower hill station the room looked very nice and customers were right about not hearing any pub noise etc the bed was comfy and room cleaning was prompt and efficient i cannot fault the staff they were extremely nice and helpful they went the extra mile and treated me as a guest and not a customer i was not just a number to them there was only a bit of a miscalculation with my breakfast bill but it didn t become a hassle because it was efficiently sorted when i travel again to london i would stay here again it was my first time traveling solo and my first time in england thank you for contributing to my positive experience in the uk
