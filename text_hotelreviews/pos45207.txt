the room was furnished wonderfully it was spacious and very airy the added touches in the bathroom such as toothbrushes and the men s grooming kit were a pleasant surprise as were the slippers also the complimentary beer in the fridge an added bonus was the bottle of milk in the fridge for your tea and coffee overall a very pleasant stay and i would highly recommend you to stay here
