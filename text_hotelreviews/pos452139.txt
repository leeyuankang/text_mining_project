we had access to the executive lounge which offered breakfast afternoon tea and canap s the breakfast was a bit limited as only offering continental rather than full english however we were impressed with the extra options throughout the day the facility in general staff were friendly and would quickly try to replenish food when low but could do with more staff at peak times
