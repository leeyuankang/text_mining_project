we stayed in a double room which was extremely comfortable and had plenty room the en suite was beautifully decorated and also a good size not cramped as some can be we didn t eat in the restaurant but the food coming out looked delicious we did have a drink in the bar which was very pleasant and not too expensive for a hotel as hotel prices are sometimes ridiculous would definitely come back and recommend this hotel only mins from kings x wonderful
