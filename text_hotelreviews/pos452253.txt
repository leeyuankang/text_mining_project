the staff were amazing and not just at the reception any employee was able to help me with all the questions i could have had don t expect a lot from the standard rooms not the executive a solid had everything a person might need but the furniture was a bit worn out not everywhere more than good for a couple of days stay location was excellent close to the canary wharf jubilee line station plus there are big malls in just minutes walk from the hotel
