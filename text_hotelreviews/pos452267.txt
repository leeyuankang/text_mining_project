really beautiful hotel i travel a lot and this is the best one i ve stayed in so far the price i got for my room was worth it definitely prices have gone up but it s defiantly eorth the stay the room was huge for one person the wardrobe was massive i appreciate the little feature of a speaker being in the bathroom overall worth it
