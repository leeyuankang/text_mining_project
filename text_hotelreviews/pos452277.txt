a lovely experience of our stay the lobby is nice and welcoming the rooms very spacious ours were on floor so a very picturesque view of love neon skyline and the beautiful canary wharf in fact we could see tower bridge from our room as it was a river view shame we didn t stay for new year s eve we could have enjoyed the fireworks from our bedroom window nice and clean as well and comfortable the location is excellent as a short walk on the foot bridge you are right into a wonderful shopping mall through which one can access the jubilee line the check in and check out was easy and straight forward tesco direct just a block away so very handy the overall feel of relatively new canary wharf was awesome especially the river side good facilities in the room such as iron mini bar beware don t use it very overpriced drinks buy yourself from the next door tesco express tea making facilities and security box would definitely stay again
