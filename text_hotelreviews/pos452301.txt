really comfy massive bed slept better than i have for ages lovely thick dark curtains which made it pitch black and very sleep inducing very quiet room on the floor no fan no air con no water noises from other rooms lovely very friendly staff nothing was too much trouble we want to return for a night stay as soon as we can
