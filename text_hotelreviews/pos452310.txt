from checking in to departure our whole experience was fantastic information from booking com hadn t been sent through that there were of us but a spare bed was brought in within half an hour we enjoyed the executive booking and the added bonuses that went with it the canap s drinks etc in the evening and we loved the full breakfast it set us up well for the whole day traipsing round london the beds were comfy and bathroom facilities were great nice amount of toiletries the view from floor was amazing thank you there is nothing we could complain about other than it would have been nice to stay another night x
