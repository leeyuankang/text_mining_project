the first day friday we planned to do afternoon tea in the shard the concierge who looked after our bags gave us some advice about what was around that area and it was one of the best parts of the weekend the beds where amazing and also the breakfasts not many places have a nice cooked breakfast from a hot plate but the hilton are an example plenty of choice from the continent too rooms were immaculate and they pushed ours up the cleaning ladder so we could get sorted quicker the rooms wi fi enabled me to watch the ufc in the early hours of sunday morning without any buffering at all much appreciated customer for life now see you again soon
