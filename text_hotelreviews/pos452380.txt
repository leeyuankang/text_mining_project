booked rooms for my family to stay in as i got married at their venue check in was very good and i was able to get rooms close together and managed to get an early check in the wedding finished late my family were able to get a late check out upon request customer service is everything and this made their stay that much more comfortable as i left them for my honeymoon i was very happy with the way all staff interacted with me absolutely perfect stay good value for money reputation intact i am a londoner so this review takes into account many other places i have stayed at and this one was worth every penny i d like to add my bridal suite was also well and beyond excellent and the complimentary strawberries was very thoughtful thank you once again
