our first contact with the hotel was a quick coffee and snack at the cafe bar the member of staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful putting together a quick snack of croissants and coffee after local errands we came back for lunch were met by a different member of staff but received the same excellent customer service the lunch salads was very tasty and well proportioned the double room was a good size and we found the tv speaker in the bathroom quite amusing bearing in mind the busy location and our room was at the front of the hotel the glazing was very effective and we slept well the buffet breakfast was also excellent with quality items the nutella muffins were a welcome surprise treat we ll definitely be staying again at our next trip to canary wharf
