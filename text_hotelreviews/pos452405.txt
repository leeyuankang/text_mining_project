arrived at the hilton and no record could be found of our stay made through bookings com even though we had received regular mail from b com reminding us of our upcoming stay brett the front of desk manager telephoned bookings com and after about an hour she finally was able to confirm our rooms she was brilliant and made our stay great but so dissapointed with b com as the ahilton staff advised this happens every week so stressful for x all concernedandagency not doing their job hotel was lovely
