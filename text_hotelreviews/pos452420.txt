i remember travelling the world with my mum during holidays we d always stay in hilton hotels my favourite being the one in durban south africa i have always had a good experience with the one in canary wharf but my last stay was off putting due to rude housekeeping the aircon did not function properly and asked for someone to come and have a look the young man who attended to this was extremely rude and made us feel like we were incompetent of using the aircon it was numerous to also see the genius struggle to get the aircon to work when i reported this to the receptionist she just couldn t careless however i d like to thank the concierge who assisted is with finding the nearest parking facilities
