the bed was enormous so comfy and we slept very well the staff on reception were extra helpful and when we called to arrange an earlier check in they advised us that they would try to have our room ready but if not we could leave our bags with the concierge which we did this meant we could walk around london without the hassle of carrying our bags around too
