very comfortable beds free fast wifi and very professional staff the breakfast buffet was to die for the hot food was always hot the selection of foods reminded me of a smorgasboard on a cruise ship smoked salmon and ham off the bone through to a full cooked breakfast or individually made omelettes fresh fruit and gorgeous pastries rounded things off the location offers fast and easy access to the rest of london via the london transport network with canary wharf and its high class shops near by a great place to stay for a weekend in london
