the hotel was spotlessly clean light and airy and the staff were wonderful our stay was great the breakfast selection and service was fantastic and my husband had just had a significant birthday so the hitel upgraded our room and had put in a lovely birthday cake and some chocolate dipped strawberries which was a lovely touch
