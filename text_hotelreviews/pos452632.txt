gorgeous hotel with really friendly staff the room was fantastic and had a great view of london minutes on the tube from the centre of london and a minute walk to the tube station very cheap for the quality of hotel and location we got upgraded to a deluxe room for free to celebrate a birthday too definitely stay there again
