the staff were fantastic i really have to praise the restaurant staff for responding to quickly and effectively to a comment i made after my meal in the restaurant i happened to say that i felt the cost of the chicken supreme was out of proportion to the size of the portion i was not expecting anything to be done as it is a london hotel and therefore i expect prices to be high however i was pleasantly surprised when a waiter brought a complimentary desert to me as i sat in the lounge later on then the resturant manager i think or perhaps the duty manager came over to explain that he had read my comment card and wanted to make up for the small portion hence the desert that was good enough in terms of service recovery but it got better because when i checked out the whole meal had been taken off my bill really above and beyond what i expected but very much appreciated so i would happily return to the hotel because i feel i can trust them do what they can to make me feel valued
