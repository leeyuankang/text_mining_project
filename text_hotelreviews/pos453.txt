superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her teddybears clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table the underground is only a minute walk so getting around was very easy i am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it
