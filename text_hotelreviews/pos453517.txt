visited the hotel with my grandchildren for night stay the family room was very spacious and beds were comfortable and clean breakfast was a fabulous event in the hotel but a little pricey pp staff throughout the hotel were very attentive helpful and friendly particularly towards the children this made our stay more relaxed
