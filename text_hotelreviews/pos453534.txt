the room was a great size and the bathroom too it was a double room but we had two comfy double beds which was an added bonus and a seating area too also we had fantastic views as we were on the floor as there was windows and it was nice and airy when we needed it to be i was in london as a present from my husband for my birthday present and just after we arrived at our room they arrived with slices of gorgeous carrot cake with the inscription happy birthday so that was a really nice touch overall a lovely hotel very central very near holborn tube station very near covent garden mins walk for the markets there and the fab restaurants and bars there
