the hotel is easy to locate for a first time london traveller and strategically situated in the moderately quiet location of west london without being too far away from the main shopping district of oxford the proximity to holborn underground was a saving grace because it is a logical alternative should the heathrow express fail you such as on christmas eve for example finally the concierge staff are incredibly and consistently helpful when you need support and directions
