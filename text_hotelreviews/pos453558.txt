it was a minute walk from tube station with plenty of nearby restaurants although i recommend the hotel restaurant on the first floor the food was reasonably priced and we were left satisfied the staff were friendly and helpful highly recommend using the facilities you won t go wrong if you ask to be moved away from the back
