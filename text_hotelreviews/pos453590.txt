the room was nice and big with facility to the pool the staff was friendly and helpful to us while staying although we had some problems with the credit card which we had to talk to several people through the main line for the hotels before we were transfer to someone in the actual hotel to help us the beds were ok but could had been more comfortable for a five star hotel the rooms need to be remodeled as well because of this and the price being expensive i did not feel it was not a good value although if the issues were addressed then i would say it was excellent the staff was very helpful in getting cabs and holding our luggage
