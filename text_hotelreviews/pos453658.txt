i m a wheelchair user but did not book a disabled room as i can walk enough to manage bathrooms and had able bodies with me on arrival the staff made a point to help me with doors and seemed genuinely worried i would struggle during my stay even though there were no issues it showed that they care about the customer experience plus the water pressure in the bathroom was epic
