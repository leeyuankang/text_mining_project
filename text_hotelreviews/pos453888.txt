excellent front desk staff very helpful at check in even moving us to a more quiet room at the back of the hotel we had lost a personal item either at the airport or the train station and they tried hard to help us recover it registering our details at all the appropriate offices and providing the hotel as a contact point later after we had issues changing money outside the hotel and they solved the problem with ease and grace included breakfast was best of four hotels we stayed in on our trip through netherlands
