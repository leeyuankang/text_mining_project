the hotel design and staff were great and welcoming great drink prices as well the artwork was a cool touch and gave you something to look at as for the rooms they were clean had a n esspresso machine and the separate shower and bath were great as i was able to soak in the tub for partying the night before as my partner showered lol it s a great place and the price was nice as well
