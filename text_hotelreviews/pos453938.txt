the hotel was minutes away from the town centre by bus and not as close as we were led to believe online the night barman on our first two nights couldn t wait to get rid of us and was quite miserable i saw a mouse running around the kitchen area the staff said the were aware of the mice but couldn t get rid as they were protected the hotel was pricey for it s location although very nice inside
