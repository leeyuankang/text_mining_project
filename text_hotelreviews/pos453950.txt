nice modern hotel rooms had good space and nice facilities including bathtub nespresso coffee machine and a normal shower bath as well friendly staff speaks perfect english and will gladly help you whether it s about storage of your luggage or how to get back to the airport there is a lot of art displayed in the halls we didn t use the bar restaurant but from the outside it seemed like a nice cosy stylish place the pictures of the hotel does in fact represent it very nicely
