room was lovely and had everything we needed including plenty of towels nice toiletries and a nespresso machine location was perfect minute walk to the bus and then minute ride to central station personally i don t understand why people complain about location given that it s accurate on their website and great value for money if you want to be centrally located then pay times the price for a mediocre central hotel staff were very nice and accommodating
