the bed was amazing the hotel itself was really quirky and wasn t too far from dam square min bike ride the rental bikes from the hotel were perfect and it s great there is the option of leaving your bike in the garage to avoid a wet seat didn t eat at the restaurant but it looked lovely room service was great and easy hotel was secure as well and a free safe in the room that you could choose your own code to was perfect
