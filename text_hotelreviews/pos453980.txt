had a lovely stay here with a few friends staff on the desk were very friendly and welcoming we had a luxury quadruple room and it was lovely even nicer than i expected from the pictures it may not be in the city centre but we had no problems getting to and from the centre via bus and later on the night bus would definitely stay here again in the future
