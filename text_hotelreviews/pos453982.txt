the suite was awesome it is quirky and spacious with the biggest jacuzzi inside a hotel room that i have ever been in i am and both my wife and i could fit in the tub together without touching each other the bed was comfortable and i liked the fact that it is a little outside all the city traffic about a walk into town it felt like our own private little heaven simply wonderful
