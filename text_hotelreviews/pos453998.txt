the hotel was perfectly positioned it was slightly outside of the main city center but easily accessible by bus the bus stops just outside the hotel and takes about minutes to the central station our room was very comfortable and the nespresso coffee machine was a real treat although we didn t swim the outside pool and terrace area was really nice
