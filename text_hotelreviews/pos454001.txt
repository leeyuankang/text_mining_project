the breakfast was amazing and the courtyard we sat in to eat was so lovely the staff was so helpful and kind going the extra mile when we were initially unhappy with the first room they offered us due to the completely see through shower we were mother and adult son yikes they offered us a bigger room and a breakfast and we were very pleased and felt valued and respected by the lovely staff our visit to amsterdam was made all the more delightful by our lovely stay at the westcord art hotel
