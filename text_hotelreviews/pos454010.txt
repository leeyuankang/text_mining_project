the room was very nice and the bed was big enough and comfortable we particularly liked the nespresso machine in the room with some complimentary capsules so we could enjoy coffee in bed every morning the bathroom was quite big for the size of the room our room was particularly quiet and the hotel is situated in a very nice area it takes about minutes on public transport to get to the airport a nice street with caf s and restaurants is just a few minutes away and you can walk to the city centre in less than minutes the staff was also very nice and helpful all in all it was a great choice
