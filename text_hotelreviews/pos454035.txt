breakfast was fabulous the restaurant was probably the best meal we had the whole of our trip staff were fantastic and catered for your every need nothing was too much trouble very clean bus stops are right outside you could buy your travel tickets at reception which is extremely helpful definitely buy your attraction tickets at the hotel too as you will skip the huge lines cannot fault the hotel and the staff
