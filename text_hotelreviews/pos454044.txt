the cocktail barman manno was so helpful there was no cocktail he wouldn t make even if it wasn t on the menu he provided me with so much information about attractions and was very polite and a good worker the bed was very soft which was perfect for my girlfriend but a little too soft for me but it didn t affect my sleep so i am more than happy
