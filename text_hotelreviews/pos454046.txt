we had booked a large room and weren t disappointed at the size or the d cor the room had a large double bed desk minibar good wardrobe space two large drawers tv showing and ample plugs including usb ports to charge those all important smart phones without reducing the plug space and a large desk the room had a large couch banquette type by the window aircon nespresso machine kettle take your own teabags the bathroom was interesting because it was enclosed in glass which you may see from photos fear not if staying with friends or parents the frosted glass stops prying eyes and the toilet is in a completely separate section of the room the shower was good quality sunken bath excellent overall the room was well appointed however not particularly bright light wise due to bulbs not working and a rather strange switch and lighting arrangement the bed was extremely comfortable think a lenny henry endorsed chain in the uk and then some in size and quality of linen overall room was excellent quality and value
