everything very hard to fault the hotel everywhere is kept very clean the junior suite was lovely so quiet i was worried because we were near the lift that we d get a lot of noise pollution but you couldn t hear a thing the staff were also very accomdating courteous polite bus stop right outside the door so your at central station in so convenient
