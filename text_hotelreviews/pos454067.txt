staff were very welcoming and helpful room was cosy had all the facilities you d require and was very clean the bar and restaurant were open late serving good drinks and food all the artwork around the building was quirky and gives the hotel something over others it is a little further out of the town than some hotels but there is a bus stop just outside with a regular service and a day pass for busses and trams is only a few euro takes minutes at most to get in to the town
