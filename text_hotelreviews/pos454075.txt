it was a very quirky hotel with very friendly staff the staff was extremely helpful especially rachel and they provided great customer service although we wanted to have the experience of riding bikes to city center it was a bit cold for us so we decided to take the bus instead and the hotel was only about a minute bus ride away from city center
