the location was fine only minutes by bus the hotel is on a main road but was so soundproof the room was so spacious and attractive we stayed in a junior suite and it was lovely the hotel was kind enough to provide us with a bottle of wine and water on arrival our room had every amenity which was replenished daily wifi was strong and the tv had a few uk channels the bath was huge it was definately one of the best highlights the only gripe we really have was over breakfast the price is far too high admittedly we didn t pre book but even the discounted price is steep for the quality quantity also the breakfast dining experience seemed somewhat cold and rushed the dinner service on the other hand was faultless and worth every penny one other point was the bed we did ask for a large double and i noticed we had two single matresses sandwhiched together with a double matress topper however this was not noticable when sleeping you get free coffee capsules for the machine every day but if these are dented which a few of ours were they wouldn t work
