this is by far the best hotel experience we have ever had the staff was superb especially rachel she was so friendly and helpful always had a smile on her face and very welcoming the room was large and comfortable it was very clean and up to date the wifi was nice and easy to connect to the restaurant was also very good for dinner there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel that makes is so easy to get around in minutes you are in the city center i would recommend this hotel not one complaint
