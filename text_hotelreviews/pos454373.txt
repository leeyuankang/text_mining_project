literally everything the design of the hotel the staff the restaurants the shopping the spa the guest treatment cleanliness of rooms were all the best you could expect anywhere plus for such a big hotel there was lots of privacy amazing layout that facilitated this just getting to your room is exciting in itself as fun surprises and design touches stand out at you the rooms were absolutely amazingly designed and tailored for the refined taste in life kind of people room sizes are just right and lots of emphasis on natural lights was put into the architecture oh and they got marshal speakers and top notch entertainment fashion magazines and packed bar coffee machines real coffee machines in every room loved the lowered hangout lobby where art and fashion is also on display for sale like a mini art gallery
