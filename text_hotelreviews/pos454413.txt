the staff here could not be more helpful from the moment we arrived we were treated really well both rooms were upgraded for free which was a lovely touch as some of our guests were new to amsterdam and had never stayed in a w hotel before we found the drinks prices really reasonable in the bar and the staff seemed to make the effort to remember what drinks we liked to order they also would make an effort to use our names when we arrived left daily the rooms are really beautiful and the design of this hotel is lovely when i go back to amsterdam i will be staying here again this is also the best location is the perfect spot as it is near everything you need to get to
