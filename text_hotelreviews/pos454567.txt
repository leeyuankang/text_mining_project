breakfast buffet was great included champagne strawberry and served until clock which was great after a late night however the hot choice became more limited the nearer it got very central location for most things and lots of restaurants on the same street if you didn t want to go into the centre of the city but it was a bit noisy at night if your room is at the front of the hotel
