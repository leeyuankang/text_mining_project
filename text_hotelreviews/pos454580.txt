an excellent hotel at an excellent location the hotel is grand the check in and check out was very smooth just a five minute walk to dam square and about mins to rembrandt square the whole street is lined with shops and cafe s so you can find everything you may need a bike rental down the road and the hotel offers their own bike rental facilities as well we had a triple room which was really big compared to hotels in europe we were very comfortable in the room with all our baggage the staff is very helpful and courteous they kept our bags in their locker room while we went for a short trip to rotterdam we did not eat at the hotel as there was a lot of choice in the street so cannot comment about the food overall a fantastic experience highly recommend and will surely return one day thanks
