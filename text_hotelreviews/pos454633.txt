very impressed with the atmosphere within the hotel it was peaceful despite being very busy helpful staff the breakfasts were more than adequate excellent choices on a daily basis the restaurant the flies which is situated in the adjoining building is an experience not to miss excellent location only spent four nights here but regretted not booking a longer stay if i return to amsterdam then would stay here again
