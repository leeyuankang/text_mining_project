worst customer service that i ever been into a receptionist name called demi was so rude we asked to pay a deposit and city tax when we first arrive during check in but when we checked out we shown them the printed receipt of the payment demi ask us again for the city tax that we already paid and her attitude was really bad unfriendly at all the overall hotel was not bad but the staffs need more training at least welcome us with a smile and sort things out politely spoiled our day
