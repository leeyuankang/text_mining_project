excellent location within canals walk around and find lots of restaurants and shops very easy access to dam square and museums the pillows and the beds were very comfortable bathroom was spacious not cramped breakfast spread was excellent with server named sri as a breath of fresh air every morning i like that you need key card to enter premises if late at night for security
