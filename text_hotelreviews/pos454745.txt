the location is excellent being only a min walk from dam square the hotel rooms were clean and tidy at all times though slightly small for adults sharing but we managed fine the staff were absolutely excellent throughout the hotel particularly the ladies on front desk nothing was too much trouble directions tourist info and even down to printing out our boarding passes the breakfast was great and provided a wide choice juice tea etc hot food cereals fruit pastries etc it just set us up for the day would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again
