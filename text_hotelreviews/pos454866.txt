this hotel was in walking distance of all the attractions tram stop nearby we had a room at the back which was quite small but very clean with a great shower room and overlooked the canal it was very quiet and peaceful the staff were all excellent very friendly and super helpful they were able to give excellent advice about which attractions to visit and how to get to them they were very helpful in sorting out a couple of small personal problems we had on our arrival with items we had forgotten to bring the bed was comfortable and there was a good range of breakfast choices a great stay would visit again and would recommend to friends
