booked rooms of for girls and when we arrived one of these wasn t available we were disappointed we had to be split at first but were offered free breakfast for the mornings we were there and it was lovely so much choice and very tasty the rooms were lovely clean and modern and the hotel was in a brilliant location in amsterdam definitely recommended
