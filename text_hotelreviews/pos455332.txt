absolutely star service from the moment we walked in the entire experience room restaurant bar staff was elegant without being pretentious if you want to do central london you couldn t have nicer more convenient accommodations not sure how big the stafford is but it has a very quiet and boutique presence in the middle of london the bed and the bathroom were to die for
