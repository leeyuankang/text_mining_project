location ideal bed very comfy and full size luxury bath previously stayed in the savoy but it only had a tiny bath we were offered a welcome drink but when we got to the bar the staff didn t know anythjng about it after finally getting a manger we were offered a limited selection of soft drinks which was a shame most hotels will include alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks or a cocktail room was spacious and bed very comfy
