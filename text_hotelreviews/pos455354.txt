from the moment you arrived the staff were warm and welcoming our room was beautifully decorated and a good size with a luxurious bathroom and the most comfortable bed and pillows i have ever experienced the american bar has so much atmosphere and is a wonderful location to meet other guests and other city workers as a guest of the hotel you can reserve a table and eat from an extensive bar menu if you wanted a more informal evening the main restaurant has just recently been refurbished and is beautiful a great improvement on their original design with great music not too loud and a delicious new menu to boot the location is quiet but still only a min walk to the national art gallery
