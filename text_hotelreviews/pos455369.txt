i usually stay at the stafford when in central london this stay was like others so relaxed and comfortable in all respects the top floor room was so quiet that it was hard to believe i was in the centre of london the breakfast is highly recommended clearly cooked to order and immaculately presented wifi is excellent throughout and the staff friendly and engaging
