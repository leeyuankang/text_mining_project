having traveled extensively this year we were very pleasantly surprised to find we receive exactly what we booked from arrival to departure we received star service the staff were from doorman to waiters and bar staff we declined to pay the extra for a king size bed but were comfortable in the booked queen size room however if we had been staying more than the one night i think we might have opted for the upgrade they offered a tea tray which duly arrived while we were out though the coffee machine was fine breakfast was till which is a nice change having been to a late dinner dance the evening before and food of good variety and quality even sough dough bread the american bar at the rear where they also serve food through the day was a wonderful surprise with a well protected courtyard and overhead portable heaters for milder days all in all a great find well decorated and furnished will return when next in london
