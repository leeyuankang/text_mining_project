i accidentally made a non refundable reservation for the wrong date they were kind enough to allow me to change the date we were upgraded to master suite breakfest was great a bit pricy there are plenty of other breakfest options in the area so we had some days at the hotel other days in a cafe up the street great location close to everything yet very quiet
