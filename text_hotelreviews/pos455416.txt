a lovely central but quiet location the hotel oozes charm and character the room was comfortable and a good size though not over large no views but good bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space the staff were helpful attentive and happy we had a lovely stay comfortably decorated for christmas it was so welcoming without being extrovert
