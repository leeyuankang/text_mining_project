fabulous view easy to get to on the bus from euston station very pleasant friendly receptionist breakfast was an extra each but we were seated in a very nice quiet cool part of the breakfast room and there was a good choice of hot and cold breakfast foods bed was very comfortable and best of all we could open the windows and because it was on the river side of the property it was quiet overnight excellent choice of eateries nearby for dinner
