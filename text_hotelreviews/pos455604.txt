large and particularly comfortable bed in a spacious room with fantastic views out across the river and very quiet too super friendly staff who made us very welcome we mentioned in passing that it was my husband s birthday when checking in and returning to our room after our evening out discovered that ruben on reception had sent chocolates and a bottle of wine by way of celebration an extremely thoughtful gesture that was much appreciated
