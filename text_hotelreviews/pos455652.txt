the location was excellent our view of tower bridge the shard and the river thames from our room was amazing day and night so along with a comfy bed we couldn t ask for anymore all the communal areas in the hotel were very clean and welcoming and the outside eateries were just perfect with a great selection of food and drink we ate tapas at the terrace in front of the bridge and stayed all day the staff were all very polite and well mannered so all in all it was a great place to stay
