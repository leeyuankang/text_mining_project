the view and location are fantastic but that s already been covered by everyone else what i wanted to highlight was the receptionists who were extremely nice my friend and i had three different bookings for days these were three different types of rooms when we got there i checked if they can arrange just one room for us so we don t have to move to different rooms during our stay i knew the rooms had different rates but they gave us a fantastic twin room with a nice view the lady at the check in counter was very accommodating if i ever go back to london i would definitely stay there again
