staff were really helpful friendly i was here on my own they looked after me really well i ate in the brasserie which i d recommend especially if you are travelling for business it s relaxed enough to eat alone reasonably priced the hotel itself has lovely views is located next to tower bridge the rooms are spotless and comfortable
