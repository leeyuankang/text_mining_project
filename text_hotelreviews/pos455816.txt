the room was excellent and very clean our room was river view so we expected a decent bed and were not disappointed the only improvement would have been a king size bed but i realise the space is limited the bathing facilities are also top class and very clean the location is class as st katherine docks and the surrounding area are all of a superior standard we have stayed with you several times and it has always been a pleasurable experience the staff are all very helpful and efficient and made our time with you a delight
