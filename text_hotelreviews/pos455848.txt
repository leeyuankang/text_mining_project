location the friendly staff and lovely open entrance space didn t eat there as some reviews were not great but the space looked very stylish the exterior of the building is a bit of an ugly duckling but so very much nicer inside it really is the location that is so special literally at the foot of tower bridge next to the tower of london and with st katherine s dock just behind with loads of restaurant and bars to choose from really recommend it
