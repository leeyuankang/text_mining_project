taken in isolation the external impression of the hotel is not as impressive as many other locations in london however inside it is great the location is fabulous and the proximity of all of the other astounding architecture completely changes your impression great place to use as a base camp for exploring north and south of the river with the added benefit of all the other activities going on around st katherine s dock
