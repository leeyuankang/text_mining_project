best location in london right at foot of tower bridge and tower of london and with st katherine s docks behind it we were spoiled for choices of restaurants shops bars and things to do a hopper pas for big bus tours gave us freedom to use the stop at tower of london as a commuter service to downtown lor we could just walk out of our hotel and take the boat instead if we chose at the front entrance on the river is a lawn area with food trucks and a bar with lots of seating all around a perfect spot to watch london go by whilst sipping a cocktail and eating pizza or traditional english fare
