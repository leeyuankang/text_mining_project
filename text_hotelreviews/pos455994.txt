i ve stayed at this hotel before and it just keeps getting better the location and view of course are its main selling points and they don t disappoint but it s the modern comforts style with old style details that keeps me coming back the staff is always super friendly and accommodating the beds are comfortable and the rooms really nice with some very nice touches like an ironing board which i needed during this business trip and hair dryers in the room and in the bathroom everything was super clean with the amenities one expects it s truly an excellent hotel
