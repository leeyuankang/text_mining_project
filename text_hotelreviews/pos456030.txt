the bedroom was comfortable and the double glazing was very good the cooked breakfast was very good it was buffet style so you could have as much as you wanted and was all very tasty we paid for a room with view which was just what we got with a good view of tower bridge we were on the first floor and would of been better if we were on a higher floor the hotel is next to st kathrine s dock which has a good selection of restaurants
