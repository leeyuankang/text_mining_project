our two night stay at the tower was a perfect the room we had was a very good size and very clean and with all the amenities and the location couldn t have been better we had upgraded to the executive room which we were a little unsure of at the time but would definitely recommend and do again the breakfast was delicious and the before dinner canopies were the perfect thing to come back to before getting changed and heading back out the staff were all very helpful and welcoming and we look forward to staying here again soon
