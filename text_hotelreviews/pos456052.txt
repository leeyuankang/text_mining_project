we stayed september and enjoyed it a lot so we came back february we weren t happy with the view that we had in the first room so we asked so swap and they swapped our room for one on the floor we were originally on the floor which we were very impressed and happy about the bar is lovely and although the cocktails are expensive they are very nice
