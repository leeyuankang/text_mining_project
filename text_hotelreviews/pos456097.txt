the welcome at reception was brilliant we felt really at home the food in the brasseries was out of this world we had scallops to start followed by the sea bass the produce was superb and everything was cooked perfectly the sauces were also incredibly well made wherever you go in the hotel you find smiley warm helpful staff we haven t had an experience like that in a london hotel in this price range ever
