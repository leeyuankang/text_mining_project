the extra s provided by the hotel really helped us to enjoy our day stay there the staff were very friendly and willing to assist us with the problem with the extra bed in the room the room was a bit gloomy but was good for a short stay the place is located at a convenient spot close to the tube station so perfect for travelling in and out of the place good eating spots nearby and very close for the shopping enthusiasts as it s short distance from oxford street
