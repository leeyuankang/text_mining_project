the bed was fantastic as were the bed sheets and the bathroom although small was very nice the cleaning staff did a great job with the room when we asked them to clean and overall we were really satisfied with the room the location is really great especially if you want to catch the tube as it is just across the road and has the northern and victoria lines which take you into the city
