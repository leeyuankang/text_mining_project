the five star service i stayed here times for a total of days over weeks to be close to the uclh as my husband was seriously ill in the hospital the staff and service were superb and on hearing of my dilema did everything to make my stay as comfortable and worry free as possible nothing was to much trouble i have a bad back but the beds are so comfy with clean crisp white linen pillows and duvet were so soft like sleeping on a cloud i stayed in both superior king and standard rooms and all were of same high standard the only difference is you get robes and slippers in superior rooms which are also larger breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of choice to suit every taste the evening meals are delicious and reasonably priced for a london hotel buses and tube station right outside the door perfect would definitely book again if i needed to stay in london and highly recommend
