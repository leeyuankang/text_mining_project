the staff was very courteous and helpful bed and pillows were very comfortable location was ideal very close to all the major sights and to the underground there were also plenty of places for a quick lunch or food to go it also helped that there was a tesco express doors away and a sainsbury s across the street i would definitely stay at the radisson blu edwardian grafton again
