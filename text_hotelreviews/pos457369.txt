this was a great place to stay shuttle was so easy and drivers were very friendly chantal on reception could not have been friendlier the rooms are not spacious but have everything you need our view from the floor was stunning so easy to get into the city fifteen minutes by tram and trams run every minutes the stop is a three minute walk from the hotel i would definitely stay here again
