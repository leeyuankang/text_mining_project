the room exceeded my expectations and was a lot bigger than i expected upon arrival the lady at reception i wish i remembered her name instantly greeted us and told us everywhere to go and where not to go in amsterdam she spent the best part of minutes making us feel welcome and willingly giving us her advice we had booked at spa zuiver you have to go for the next day and she rang them up asking directions to get to the hotel and made it so easy for us make sure you use the airport shuttle free of charge on your way to the hotel as it makes your trip so much easier the hotel itself was beautiful and so was the standard room although it was definitely more than standard i took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the staff were so lovely and decorated the room for him as i requested i m not one to stay in the same hotel twice as i like to experience different hotels but i am booking this again next time we are in amsterdam the skybar was incredible and makes the hotel even better than it is and gives you a real feel of luxury at an affordable price i honestly had the best time at this hotel the only negative thing that happened was on our first night we were told we could go up to the skybar with our drinks and when we got up to the top the bar man was clearly not in a good mood and was rushing us to leave when it was only and shut at midnight however everything else was perfect so he s lucky his colleagues made everything else so nice for us otherwise i would be giving a completely different review all in all stunning hotel lovely sized rooms and bathroom friendly staff apart from one good location tram stop is situated from building and takes to get into central station skybar is a bonus and hotel airport shuttle taking all the stress away from getting to and from the hotel thank you ramada see you again
