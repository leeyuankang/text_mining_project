i really liked this place beautiful green area outside with benches to chill out on and the tram is a minute walk i love the rooftop bar or the idea of it anyway tried it one evening but left soon after arriving as it was way overpriced for a heineken other than that it was great the room was lovely and really spacious considering amsterdam room sizes are normally minature tv with some decent channels too
