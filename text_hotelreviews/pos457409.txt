the rooms were beautifully decorated and the view was amazing we didn t eat there but we had drinks in the bar we wound them reasonable for a hotel and matching the price you would pay in england for a cocktail the staff were so friendly and helpful this place is worth the money you pay for if you wish to stay in a nice hotel the tram stop was outadie the hotel and a unlimited ticket we could but from the gift shop for under euros per person twenty minutes on the tram and you could hope off at dam square of central station
