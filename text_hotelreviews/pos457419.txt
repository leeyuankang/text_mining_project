it is very easy to travel to the centre of amsterdam on the tram the panoramic view from our room was great we loved the decor and the way the rooms were laid out around the central lift shaft to gave every room a good aspect the choices at breakfast were amazing we chose this hotel partly because of the shuttle to the airport
