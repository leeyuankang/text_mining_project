the staff is so friendly they helped us to locate the attractions we wanted to go for and showed us the way how to get there we really enjoyed the breakfast at ramada apollo the variety of options was huge and i am pretty sure that everyone can find something for themselves the hotel is clean and tidy and the interior design is really nice me and my partner really enjoyed a sky lounge with an overall view above the city where you can chill and enjoy your drinks
