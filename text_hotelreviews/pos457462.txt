this hotel is large has professional staff and great views it is quite a distance from the canal district so you require a daily tram ticket for euro walk a lot or use a bike to get around the room is comfortable but noisy on the floor with the floor being the bar restaurant and breakfast area the room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom excellent except for the half shower wall which meant water ended up on the floor no matter how hard you tried there was an environmental option to not have room serviced daily we took that option and were allocated a euro voucher for the bar or restaurant good marketing really the best part was that when there was no noise from above it was a very quiet location
