very lovely staff and made my boyfriend s birthday celebration really special amazing value for money and will definitely be returning very good location with plenty of shops nearby aswell as easy access to the city centre via the metro room was very clean and tidy and i would recommend checking out the bar on the floor staff were always happy to help and were very friendly plus we were able to store our luggage after check out on our last day and returned to pick it up nearer the time of our late flight home which was very convenient i was recommended this hotel and it didn t disappoint i would highly recommend staying in an executive room as the room was very spacious and had amazing views of the city and nearby park
