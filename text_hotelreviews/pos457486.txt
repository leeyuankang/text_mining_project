stayed in the executive king room and would recommend the room was modern and spacious and with large windows had an excellent view of the surrounding area the room was clean and had all the facilities you would need iron ironing board hairdryer safe and even extras such as bath robes for the both of us and had a large bathroom with both shower and bath would recommend the rooftop bar amazing views and great bar snacks with friendly staff throughout taxis are expensive but there is a tram that goes straight to central station with different ticket types starting at euros overall excellent hotel with friendly staff would stay again
