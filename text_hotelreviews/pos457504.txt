excellent choice for breakfast hotel was very clean and staff were also very friendly and helpful balloons on our bed and message on mirror for my husband s special birthday were a nice surprise for him as was the complementary cocktail to celebrate great location easy access to centre via tram across the road loved our visit to the hotel school of the hague next door van gogh museum was excellent and anne frank house was worth the wait in a long queue our first visit to amsterdam and the ramada will not be our last
