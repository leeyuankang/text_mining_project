the hotel was well decorate so a really good location with the tram stop just outside so if you don t mind getting the tram to and from the centre it is perfect for you the sky bar was unavailable closed due to weather but the floor bar was lovely with a lot of gorgeous cocktails and a free tram service from the airport and a cheap one back after your stay which is good if you find the tram and get lucky on timing
