this hotel is in a perfect location far enough out of the centre of amsterdam for the peace and quiet but only a very short tram ride away from dam square and the trams are about every minutes and very reasonably priced the hotel staff and the airport bus driver couldn t be more helpful and polite if they tried everyone of them gave us more than enough information and even called the room minutes after us checking in to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything the room was cleaned with the beds made and fresh towels put in every day the beds were very comfortable and the rooms have a television with english channels and tea and coffee making facilities the view from the hotel is lovely all in all i d recommend this hotel to anyone and if i go back to amsterdam i will definitely be staying here again
