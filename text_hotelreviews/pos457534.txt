staff couldn t have been more helpful rooms were modern and had what we needed for a few nights stay can t thank them enough i mentioned when booking this hotel this was a trip away for my partners birthday and when arriving to the room there were balloons and a little message on the mirror just an extra touch that i really appreciate
