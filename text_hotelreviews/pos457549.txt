the hotel was clean a true reflection of the images online welcoming and friendly staff who on your arrival make sure you know everything regarding facilities transport etc excellent location near a tram stop which takes everywhere you need to go as a tourist the breakfast was superb we did not eat there in the evenings choosing instead to go into the city centre the minibus which picks up guests from the airport upon arrival and takes them back for departure is a great valued useful touch the rooms were comfortable accommodating and perfectly sized would certainly stay at the hotel again
