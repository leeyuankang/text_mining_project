i loved my stay at the ramada the staff couldn t do enough to cater for us excellent customer service hotel was very clean and modern throughout rooms are gorgeous we upgraded to an executive room worth every penny and the view was stunning especially as it had snowed in amsterdam and it was a blanket of white snow everywhere thank you ramada apollo i will most certainly be coming back i am looking already to book to come for easter
