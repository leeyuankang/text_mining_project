great staff and lovely breakfast we were especially keen on the make your own waffles yummy only thing i can criticise is i booked the room months before and ordered a deluxe double and we requested a high room with a view when we arrived to check in the reception were telling everyone that the rooms were not ready so they were upgrading us to a better room the room was a twin it was our anniversary and was smelly and on the bottom floor we were very disappointed and went to complain to be fair to the reception they did find us a better room but we saw and spoke to several others that were not so lucky as i say the reception did handle matters eventually but we did have to make a fuss apart from that it was a great stay loved the facilities and the location lots of great places around the hotel that are much more dutch than central amsterdam and we enjoyed that have a good stay
