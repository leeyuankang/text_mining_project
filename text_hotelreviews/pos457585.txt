great location just outside the city centre with a tram stop within yards of the hotel staff very friendly and helpful shuttle bus to from the airport was great and only cost euros per person when you arrive and leave the aiport do not trust the men standing near the exit asking if you need a taxi they are not actual taxi drivers and will charge you a fortune we would have paid euros if we hadn t used the shuttle bus and it s a minute journey would definitely stay here again
