friendly helpful staff good shuttle to and from the airport although this hotel is not in the centre of amsterdam it is very easy to get there as it is very close to a tram stop tickets can be purchased in the hotel if you need a supermarket or pharmacy they are only a stop away on the tram good sized rooms with comfortable beds excellent buffet breakfast we would definitely stay again
