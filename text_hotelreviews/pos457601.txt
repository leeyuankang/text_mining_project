i have no faults on this hotel we thougharlly enjoyed our stay and we can t wait to come back again the food was excellent slightly expensive especially if you include a few cocktails but excellent quality especially the curry sausage lunch menu the rooms are cosy and very very clean the top floor is gorgeous with an amazing view of the city cosy at night with blankets and nice music the whole hotel is immaculate easy accessable into dam square via tram over all the hotel is fab and made the holiday great
