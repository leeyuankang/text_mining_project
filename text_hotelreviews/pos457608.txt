the hotel is super modern and comfortable the view from my room in the floor was amazing and the bar in the floor too they offer a free shuttle from the airport and for only per person from the hotel to the airport we were upgraded for free the location is much better than the way it looks on a map you can take the tram away from the hotel and it takes you straight to the city center i would stay in ramada again if they keep these discounts
