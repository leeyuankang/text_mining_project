loved the fact that they had an indoor smoking area saved us going outdoors in the cold the staff were absolutely brilliant and helped us with any questions and always greeted us in the morning and night time seen a lot of reviews about the location but we thought the location was beautiful and even if it is a fair distance from the centre it states this when booking and plus there are trams to take you to the centre so it wasn t a problem for us the room was exactly how it was pictured stunning rooms and very comfy beds always cleaned and was completely spotless
