staff especially sebastiaan and rianne were very friendly and helpful it was our anniversary and we got a room with a view and the bed was decorated with a heart towel and balloons nice touch great location tram stop second walk from hotel the takes you right into centre in mins shuttle bus picks you up at airport and takes back to hotel for free and only each to get back to hotel so saves you getting trains or trams and saves you money too hotel bar was nice a little expensive but amsterdam is expensive no matter where you go
