the location was great on the edge of a lovely park with a lake and a running cycling perimeter track only minutes or so from the city centre by tram we had a very clean and comfortable room on the floor with a terrific view the busy bar restaurant on the floor was great with panoramic views and a vast range of cocktails and other drinks there was also a kiosk in reception where you could buy a drink and a snack all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful n b there is a free dedicated shuttle service from the airport direct to the hotel running every minutes phone the hotel for full details the return service has to be booked but costs only euros p p
