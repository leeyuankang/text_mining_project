review of ramada apollo hotel in amsterdam my husband and i recently spent four very pleasant nights at the ramada apollo hotel in amsterdam while the hotel s location was not in the city core it was easily reached in minutes on the tram from centraal train station with amsterdam s amazing system of trams there was no site within the city core that we couldn t reach from our hotel within about minutes or so thus making it convenient but less expensive than a closer location might be when we asked for a room with a view on a high floor at the registration desk we were instantly upgraded to such a room a step up from the standard smaller room we had booked we enjoyed our room very much as well as the amenities delivered daily tea and coffee the room was modern attractive and comfortable and it met all of our needs and expectations the hotel was located in a safe neighbourhood within a park setting and was a mere one minute walk from where the tram deposited us even though we arrived back at the hotel quite late each night we always felt safe especially as there were usually other hotel guests alighting from the tram with us plus other passersby on the street i think what we liked best about the hotel however was the friendly very helpful and enthusiastic staff we encountered at the reception desk we probably dealt with about four or five different staff during our stay and each one was extremely attentive knowledgeable and service oriented any questions we asked were met with instant smiles internet research maps circled with our destinations etc a note left behind for maintenance staff advised we were out of body wash in the shower resulted in a timely refill and a handful of those little sample bottles we also availed ourselves of the hotel s airport shuttle service which cost a modest euros apiece and whisked us off to schiphol airport on time and within minutes of departure
