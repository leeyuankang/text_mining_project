the staff were extremely helpful and friendly i ve gotten used to the terrible service that the dutch offer so it was so refreshing to have lovely and friendly dutch staff who actually smiled and seemed like they enjoyed their work the bed was comfortable the floor had beautiful views and the food was decent
