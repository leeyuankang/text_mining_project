we booked this hotel as we wanted to spoil ourselves at the end of a week uk european holiday it didn t disappoint hotel provided a free shuttle from the airport the hotel is located about minutes from amsterdam by tram their is a tram stop right around the corner the reception staff were great and we enjoyed a free upgrade to an spacious executive corner room on the floor breakfast was good with lots of choice but not cheap at pounds each person each morning
