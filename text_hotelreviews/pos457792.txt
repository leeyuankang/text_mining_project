really nice hotel in a good location close to the tram stop within about minutes travel to the city i travelled on my own and felt safe getting to and from the hotel as late as pm the room was not that big but compact and had all the facilities including an iron the hotel also has a shuttle service from schipol airport which was quite handy and a luggage storing facility if you arrive outside of the check in and check out time the staff are very helpful with directions and very polite the hotel also has a bar restaurant on the floor with amazing views
