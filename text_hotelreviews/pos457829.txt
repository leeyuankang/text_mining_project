while it is about min from the central activities in amsterdam the easily accessible tram is just a min walk and a great way to go after the bustle of the amsterdam central city it was wonderful to go back to our hotel relax and have quiet my husband went for a jog in the park next door and we had a great time in the bar upstairs staff was excellent and helpful
