everything i hardly ever stay in a hotel and was very surprised to how much i enjoyed my stay the staff was extremely helpful made my stay comfortable loved the floor bar the best cocktails the tram stop was just outside the hotel very easy access to and from the centre there was a free shuttle there which is located to the far left of the airport and only on the way back i would recommend and stay again
