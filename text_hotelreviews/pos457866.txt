all the staff members were so helpful and friendly after a long hour flight we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in but the staff went out of their way to help us with an early check in we found all the people at the hotel to be friendly even the morning staff at the buffet breakfast talking about the breakfast it had a good variety and was very tasty i also love the location of the hotel close to a tram min walk but if the weather is nice you can take a nice stroll into the city which we did every day our room was clean and comfortable just the shower made the bathroom pretty wet but that is something small and did not affect our stay this is one of the nicest star hotels i have ever stayed at i can honestly say it is very good value for money especially if you book some time in advance during the bust summer months thanks for making our stay memorable at this fine hotel
