it was my stay in amsterdam and this is by far the best the king executive room was exactly as expected very spacious clean and bright the bed and pillows were the comfiest of them all also the view was very pleasant to wake up to as i was on the floor i had a clear view of the city the floor roof top area is such a beautiful relaxing open space with an incredible view equipped with a bar a comfy chill out area sunbeds and also lovely chairs sofas and tables to eat staff were so welcoming and polite that i questioned whether anyone ever had a bad day they were very helpful and informative on what to do in amsterdam and where the best spots were and even gave us a toothbrush and adaptors to borrow when asked for no extra cost it s about mins from amsterdam central on tram and the tram stop is about a minute walk so overall i would recommend this hotel for all types of stay because i will be returning with no doubt
