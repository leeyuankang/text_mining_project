the staff were so helpful they answered every question we needed and could not do enough for us smiley and friendly to everyone even the unpleasant guests that had something to moan about typically being something stupid would definitely go again absolutely fantastic location and the tram is so easy to find which takes you straight to the centre it was my partners and they put balloons in the room and we received a complimentary cocktail each too
