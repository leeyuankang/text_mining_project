location was good it was a fairly short tram journey to central station and the two tram which ran close to the hotel and made all of the main area accessible the room was clean and well furnished the facilities were very good breakfast was extensive though expensive the bar on the floor had very good views although the roof top terrace was unavailable for our entire stay
