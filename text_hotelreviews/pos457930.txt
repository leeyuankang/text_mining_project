we drove to amsterdam as we were heading down to dusseldorf afterwards so needed somewhere with easy parking as amsterdam is not good for cars and parking nearer then centre is very expensive so great hotel with undergound parking and the tram stops just across the road so an easy min tram ride to dam square which is the centre of amsterdam and from there you can get anywhere purchased tram tickets from the hotel shop per person for very good value for money if you are sightseeing really nice mid priced hotel with trendy bar restaurent on the floor with panoramic views and indoor smoking room also a lovely sun terrace on the floor perfect if the weather is in your favour the building has central lifts so hit the button and there is always a quick response
