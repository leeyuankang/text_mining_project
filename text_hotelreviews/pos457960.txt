comfy bed decent shower friendly and professional staff good location easy to get to and back via trams reasonable taxi under euro if your re getting back late we didn t quite work out how to get there by the night bus right next to a large park good view from the restaurant or the top floor as you are fairly elevated over the mostly flat city
