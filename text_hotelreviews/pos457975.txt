from the shuttle pick up to the drop off by the shuttle at the airport we had a super stay at the ramada we were able to check in early with a free upgrade room on the floor with superb view of the city all the staff were very friendly and helpful the ramada is situated about minutes by tram from the heart of amsterdam but the no tram is just minutes walking distance away and runs frequently we purchased a hour pass at per person and found this a very cheap way of getting round we would have no hesitation in recommending the ramada apollo
