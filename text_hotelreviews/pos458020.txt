good location only mins by tram from dam square etc tram stops outside hotel and at for a tram ticket we were happy with the location and ease of travel into the city centre rooms were clean and bright and the shower room was spacious bright and clean also hotel reception is big open and has plenty of places to sit reception staff were efficient and helpful at all times the minibus to and from airport was great value at pp per trip much cheaper and quicker than a bus or taxi
