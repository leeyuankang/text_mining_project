apart from the comfy bed i was in love with the decoration at the lobby area the staff was so friendly that made us feel even more comfortable and they were there to answer every question the location could not be more perfect straight away to town centre within minutes with the tram stop tram being right across the hotel great view from floor floor bar was lovely and we used to stay in at nights to enjoy the spectacular view from the top with fantastic drinks
