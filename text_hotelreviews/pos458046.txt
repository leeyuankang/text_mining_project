great staf really helpful clean and quiet room good breakfast buffet it s quite expensive but worth a try good location the line tram stop admiraal helfrichstraat is only about min walk dam square is only about mins the bar in the floor is really nice though quite expensive but worth a try too just keep in mind that they have a no coat jacket policy we will surely stay here again
