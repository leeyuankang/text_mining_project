beds were really nice the place was clean and very modern which is cool we didn t really use the sky bar however we went to the roof top where you get a beautiful view of amsterdam drinks were reasonable priced and there is a really nice park just across from the hotel we chilled out there after a busy day in the town the wifi in the rooms is really good make sure to book the trips van gogh museum anne frank s house etc online to skip the queues
