the staff were ever so friendly and did everything they could to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable the room was very clean and a perfect size with lots of storage space we were on the floor and had a wonderful view of rembrandt park but we loved the experience of the view of amsterdam from the rooftop terrace which was beautiful both in the daytime and night time the hotel is located in a nice area and is in easy reach of amsterdam central by catching a tram from the nearby stop
