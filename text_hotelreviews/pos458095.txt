good variety for breakfast it is slightly expensive per person but there is something for everyone the view from our room was amazing as we were on the floor we overlooked amsterdam s skyline our room was super spacious and just what we expected the hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of amsterdam and there aren t many nice shops around but getting the tram every day let us engage with the culture more plus the hotel itself has a tram stop straight outside so going to the city centre was no problem
