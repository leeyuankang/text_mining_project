the staff were very friendly and we really liked the hotel in general free wifi is always a bonus we really didn t spend long in the hotel but always nice to be able to send a quick update to your family at the end of each day breakfast was good and the decoration in the hotel was modern and tasteful we also really liked the bar on the floor and roof terrace there is a cute little farm opposite with a few animals nice little touch
