the breakfast although a little pricier than i expected was very nice and the was an array of selection to cater for everyone the staff the room and the general service was flawless the location was a little further out but still very central with a frequent tram stop just in front of the hotel we were in the city centre in mins to compensate for the less than central location we were rewarded with fantastic views of the city and the nearby park made for a lovely place to go for a stroll and work out some of weight gained after having breakfast other good points include the shuttle bus service from the airport to the hotel and the return journey there was a charge for this but it still worked cheaper and less hassle than a private cab public transport
