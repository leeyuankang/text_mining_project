the entire hotel staff were amazing friendly and always willing to assist no matter how big or small the request may have been the stars of the team would definitely have to be joanne and roelof who really made us feel welcomed and made our first experience in amsterdam memorable the breakfast selection was good and view from restaurant was spectacular especially at night the metro point was easy accessible approximately minutes walk from the hotel and connected us to major city attractions in record time
