the view from the room was amazing hotel is located in a park which is scenic and quiet i felt it is just the right distance from central sometimes you just want to get away from all the hustle and bustle the staff were great with us and dealt with us in a professional and caring manner even when we did have a slight issue they dealt with it swiftly and went over and above to make sure we were happy id like to thank the staff for the way they treated us and a special mention to the reception manager breakfast was great everything you could think of was there also the view from the floor was special you must check out the bar on the floor the atmosphere and the food was fantastic
