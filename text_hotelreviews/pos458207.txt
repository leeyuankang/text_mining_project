we booked a panoramic view superiour double and first got a room in the centre of the floor aparently the panoramic view starts at which is too low to call panoramic in my opinion they moved us to the upper floor corner room which was bigger with twice as much windows and an amazing view over amsterdam very friendly and helpfull staff a plus is that the amsterdam metro stops in front of the building every minutes and it just takes min to get to the dam
