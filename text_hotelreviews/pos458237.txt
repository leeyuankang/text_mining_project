the ramada apollo is probably the best hotel i have ever stayed at in terms of virtually everything you could want in accommodation in a major city value for money facilities transport connections location cleanliness niceness of staff everything a shuttle bus directly to the hotel is free arriving in amsterdam at schipol airport just go to the hotel buses bus stops outside we were offered a free complimentary upgrade when we arrived and we had the most amazing corner room on the floor with epic views of the entire city at night definitely request a high level room on the last morning i woke my girlfriend up to watch the sunrise casting a golden glow across the entire cityscape it was more romantic than the notebook titanic and brief encounter all rolled into one super lovestory memories like that are what you remember about a hotel and that moment was just perfect and my girlfriend still really fancies me too the beds were massive and comfier than a thousand lazyboys lined with sheep fur floating in space everything about the room was perfect from the mood lighting to the chairs the desk telly shower room the hotel is in a wonderful location if you like doing it all on foot you re about minutes from the main centre so be prepared for epic walks home although there s still plenty to see the number tram outside the hotel is the obvious option for most people though going right the way into town within or minutes the best way though for me honestly would be by bike you can rent them at the hotel and its just a great time efficient way to travel around a city that looks do able on foot but is actually enormous in terms of scale
