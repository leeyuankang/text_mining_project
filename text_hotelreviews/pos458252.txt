the staff were very attentive and paid close attention to make sure we had a lovely stay they were very friendly and happy to help when needed could not fault the staff the hotel overall was spotless and super clean aswell as the rooms beds were comfortable and had an excellent view over the city from our room floor food and cocktails were excellent and again staff working in the bar restaraunt were super helpful and made sure we got everything we needed tram stop was just a minute walk away from the front of the hotel therefore made easy access to the centre with just a minute tram ride superb views overlooking the city on the rooftop terrance and a relaxed and enjoyable environment to be around would recommend anyone staying in amsterdam to book this hotel would definately go back and is outstanding value for money both my boyfriend and i were very very pleased with this hotel and were quite sad to be leaving as we enjoyed it so much
