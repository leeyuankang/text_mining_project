staff was very friendly and i was even upgraded from a standard single to a luxury bedroom with a king size bed the room was spacious and well equipped and everything was spotlessly clean the bathroom had a double shower cabin and a large sink though the toilet is squeezed into the extreme corner and difficult to sit on ac was superefficient during the day but not adjustable during the night the set maximum temperature could only be changed by getting instructions from reception the location is very convinient for kings s cross euston university and westend theatres
