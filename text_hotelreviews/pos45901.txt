a beautifully designed hide away in a central location we loved our stay at the radisson blue edwardian we stayed in one of the junior suites which for an city hotel all rooms were very spacious the decor was very modern and elegant we especially loved the pillows it was so comfortable it was definately one if the best nights sleep we ve had in a hotel and would love to find out how to purchase them not sure if it was in the helpful information guide we didn t have much time to read it from front to cover also loved the magnifying mirror in the bathroom perfect for applying make up staff were very helpful and rectified an issue we had with our mini bar quickly and efficiently breakfast serviced in our room was exactly what we requested and we liked the ice cube dispenser near the lifts as well the the coffee machine in the lounge area would defiantly stay here again
