the location was brilliant for our purposes and also very close to the vondelpark for morning walks close to canal boat trips if you want them and very near the rijksmuseum there are always roads and pavements being repaired in amsterdam but this wasn t a problem our room was overlooking the courtyard with trees and was nice and quiet
