the reception team were excellent what a fantastic welcome couldn t be more helpful very good restaurant recommendation at the location was superb only from warren street tube station which puts you straight onto the victoria line we were there to watch a show in victoria so the location was perfrect shopping access is also brilliant being straight on totenham court road just an easy stroll down to oxford street or covent garden it took us just to get to the british museum by foot
