had a wonderful time at the marriott the location was amazing close to everything the staff were very helpful and friendly we ate in the restaraunt and had a great breakfast every morning i would recommend any one staying there to include it in their package the dinner menu was great different every night our waitress claudia made us feel special with her kind and excellent service would stay here again
