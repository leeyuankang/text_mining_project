location great staff excellent aircon in room and non stop bathroom extractor fan a little noisy no free wifi except in the lobby bar set up mainly for american visitors very popular and i would guess guests were us not a problem with this just the food was a little too tailored for them but hey i was in the minority the on site restaurant is excellent top on trip advisor and a fantastic steak
