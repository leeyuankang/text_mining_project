our superior room on the floor was very comfortable and a reasonable size it appears to have been newly decorated and everything was pristine we were very happy with the room and the hotel itself also the hotel was in a very good location and had a cosy bar and restaurant it was a lovely place to return to each night after walking and enjoying the streets amsterdam
