myself and my best friend stayed here for our joint birthday to save us going home after a night out clubbing on friday night the staff were amazing and couldn t do enough for us we received a complimentary upgrade and birthday cake in our room i would like to say a special thank you to bachir who looked after us they provided us with a bucket of ice and champagne glasses as we had a bottle of bubbly with us we also had a group of friends come to the room to have drinks before we left for the club to which they had no problem with although there were around of us and were quite noisy for an hour or so i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying here again
