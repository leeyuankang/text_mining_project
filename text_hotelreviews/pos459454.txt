the restaurant downstairs momo was absolutely incredible the cuisine is an asian fusion type that blends modern with traditional the prawn tempura sushi and the waghu in my opinion are a must have the rooms were comfortable and clean perfect for our short stay in amsterdam the staff were also incredibly helpful and were prepared to go the extra mile for us the location of the hotel is perhaps one of the most appealing things about this hotel it is situated within the center of town and is close to all amenities and popular streets such as prinsengracht
