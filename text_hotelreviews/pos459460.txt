room was lovely we asked for a quiet room so that is why the view wasn t so good but we didn t mind they gave us a free upgrade to a a junior suite so that was a nice surprise the only problem we had was that we found the bed was very very soft not too good for someone with back trouble otherwise the hotel was lovely the hotel is one minutes walk from the nearest tram bus stop with direct links to the airport or central station
