our daughter has lived in amsterdam for nine months and when she gave us the opportunity to join her she made a reservation for us to stay at the park hotel as we entered the hotel we were immediately greeted with a glass of cucumber water from a staff member situated separately from the registration desk this was a very welcoming gesture every staff member no matter what their role provided us with the same care the entrance and reception areas are modern and light pours in through the large glass exterior we landed early stored our luggage and left for our daughter s home hotel personnel texted that our room was ready before the checkin time from our room we could see a bit of the main canal which was fun and we discovered the hotel is located in a central location our experience at the hotel was short but we very much enjoyed amsterdam seeing the city through our daughter s eyes her choice of the park hotel played a part in our enjoyment we highly recommend a stay in the park hotel
