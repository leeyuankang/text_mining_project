the staff gets a i had a fall out on the street they called the hospital arranged for a doctor and called a taxi they were spectacular in their care and concern for me the accident had nothing to do with their property but the young staff members treated me like family i cannot say enough about how impressed i was with the park hotel staff they recommended restaurants got us museum tickets and transportation tickets this is truly a lovely place to stay close to restaurants museums and the canal tour easy access to public transportation
