the location is perfect for exploring the city centre museums etc you can pick up a canal boat tour right outside the hotel and the public bus from the airport stops only few minutes walk away the staff irrespective of their role in the hotel made an effort to have a conversation with us e g one of the cleaning staff who was in the lift with us seemed genuinely interested in whether we had enjoyed our day
