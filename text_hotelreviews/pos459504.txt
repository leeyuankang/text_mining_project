the park hotel was a very nice hotel and located very central for everything my partner asked for a free upgrade of the room as it was a special occasion but the lady that checked us in said it would be extra per night so we didn t go for that she wasn t that obliging overall we had a lovely stay and the rest of the staff were more than helpful we didn t get a chance to eat in momo restaurant which was disappointing
