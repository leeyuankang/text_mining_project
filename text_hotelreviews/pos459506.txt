stylish hotel reception room loved that i told hotel in special comments that trip was a surprise for my boyfriends birthday then arrived to a banner and balloons on the bed really nice touch location was pretty good walking distance to leidesplein and rikjsmuseum and their tram stops which was useful so for the money it was lovely the comparable hotels in price in better locations where no where near as nice looking luggage storage was good in hindsight we would have booked the breakfast with the room we chose not to as it seemed expensive but most of our breakfasts just a pancake and drink each or toast and a croissant with cheese and ham came to over euros each and meant we had to try find something in the morning just to clarify as i couldn t tell from the photos the toilet it not open plan to the room its in its own dark glass cubicle at the back of the open plan bathroom
