excellent location near to all the action but it was good to have a short walk away from activity noise of the city the hot rain shower was amazing especially after being out in the cold comfy lounge and room the staff were lovely we didn t sample the breakfast which was per head because we had over spent in the brilliant shopping area loads of great cafes nearby though really recommend this hotel
