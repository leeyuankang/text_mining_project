the bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud big shower head with immediate hot water big tv screen was another bonus loved the extra shelving in the bathroom as this is an ongoing gripe that hotel bathrooms never seem to consider women need shelves for make up bags etc hotel toiletries and yes big thick toilet rolls a huge plus lots of thought and practicality was given to the comfort of the spotless rooms well stocked mini bar tea and coffee and even a universal travel plug were provided bowls of apples on each floor was a charming gesture the location around the corner from the rijksmuseum was perfect dutch hospitality courtesy friendliness is superb
