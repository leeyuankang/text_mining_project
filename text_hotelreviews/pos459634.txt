the friendliness of the staff and they were very helpful and efficient the room was perfect and the bed was very comfortable i really liked the bar area where we had a late night coffee and it was served with a chocolate and by very friendly staff there was a lovely fireplace which kept us lovely and warm after coming in from a very cold evening my husband is a wheelchair user and we found the hotel to be very accessible for our needs
