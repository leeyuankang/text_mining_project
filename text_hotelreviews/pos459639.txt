the hotel is in an excellent a location for rijksmuseum and van gogh museum the airport bus stops round the corner and also frequent trams to amsterdam central station the staff extremely helpful reception staff gave us a good recommendation for a small restaurant serving typical dutch food in easy walking distance breakfast buffet very good with a do it yourself fresh orange juice machine breakfast not included in room price bed very comfortable we had a view towards the canal on a busy road but good sound proofing from traffic noise and silent effective air conditioning
