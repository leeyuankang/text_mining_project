this hotel was beyond excellent the staff were more than helpful the room was gorgeous we booked the superior room but when we arrived at the hotel they told us they had made a mistake all the rooms were booked up so they upgraded us to an executive room which was well amazing the hotel itself was in a brilliant location and in walking distance to all the main spots would definitely stop here again
