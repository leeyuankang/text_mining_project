the hotel was boutique style and the room very nicely furnished and comfortable the hotel staff were very pleasant and we were able to check in early for which we were very appreciative having just arrived into london from an overnight flight from canada guest relations contacted is before arrival to ask if we had any specific requirements great stay overall despite some disturbance from some inconsiderate guests
