the bedroom was cosy but spacious the location is amazing i was slightly worried we would be quite a walk from the centre but it was one straight road into the centre all of the shops the coffee shops the canals and the red light district a minute walk the other direction from the hotel you would find all of the museums and tram station lovely hotel really lovely staff and the food from the room service was beautiful too
