expensive but the view of st stephan cathedral was well worth it excellent rooftop restaurant and another great view from the floor lounge my wife and i shared a standard room on the third floor and were thrilled by the high quality fixtures and furnishings for our next visit to vienna we will definitely stay at the do co because other hotels would seem ordinary
