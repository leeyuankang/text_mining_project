the location of this hotel is fantastic it has a lot of shoping restaurants and within walking distance of the opera house and other attractions it is located inside a big square plaza so there is a lot of foot traffic and very few vehicles deliveries guests may be surprised to find that the check in desk is actually on the floor instead of the hotel s entrance this is understandable due to limited space at the hotel s entrance not a problem though there are porters there to help with luggage
