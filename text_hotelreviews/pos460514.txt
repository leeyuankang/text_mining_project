if you want to be right in the centre of town on the pedestrian st stephanplatz it s a great location but you are surrounded by a tumult of tourists outside and inside the hotel the restaurant is a light and airy room with terrace the breakfast array is stunning expensive but worth every cent and the bar overlooking the square has a great vibe in the evenings my room looks fabulous as you walk in the bed is exceptionally comfortable and the shower is a massive glass cube central in the room dominating the space and delicious to use
