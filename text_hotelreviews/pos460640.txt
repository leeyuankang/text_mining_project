this is a great hotel location was ideal most attractions were within walking distance the staff from the reception desk restaurant porter were some of the nicest most friendly helpful we have encountered in quite some time the room was spacious with a well appointed bathroom very quiet the breakfast was varied would suit most people the view of the passing traffic st stephens church was a real bonus we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
