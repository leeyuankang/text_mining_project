incredibly great location everything you could possibly want for an amazing hot and or cold breakfast was included staff was great and helpful as well great recommendations and tickets for events and tours available right at the desk we even stayed an extra night so we could do a previously unplanned day trip to budapest that the hotel helped organize at our request definitely worth the day trip to see budapest but glad it was not at the expense of a day in vienna which we liked a lot more this is from someone who has visited over countries
