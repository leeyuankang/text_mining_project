the location next to the church was superb it was in the middle of the cbd and could always be found by following the church spire in the distance it was also located above a metro station the rooms were spacious designed for sustainability and all expected facilities were provided including a towel heating rack the staff were terrific breakfast with a view of the cathedral was pretty good too
