we do not usually stay at hotels of the caliber and price range of the savoy for our family vacations we decided to splurge and were rewarded with a truly memorable stay the staff were attentive friendly and made us feel that they knew us personally the family room was stylish and well appointed and the beds were very comfortable we arrived at the savoy early in the day our room was understandably not ready but we were able to check in and drop off our luggage upon our return later in the afternoon our room was still not ready but we were taken to a temporary room by a very apologetic manager and offered complimentary dinner at kaspar s which was not necessary but much appreciated nonetheless afternoon tea in the thames foyer is an experience that should not be missed our children loved the savoy so much that they wrote a thank you note to the manager and staff describing in detail how much they enjoyed their stay you really had them won over with the black cat stuffed animal on their bed thanks for making dad look awesome
