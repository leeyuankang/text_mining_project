highly recommend this hotel absolutely brilliant location with warren street tube station seconds walk away and kings cross station within walking distance my girlfriend and i received a free room upgrade upon arrival and a fresh fruit platter which was a nice touch room was a decent size for a london hotel very clean spotless bathroom with soaps shampoo and conditioner room was very quiet overlooking the rear of the hotel
