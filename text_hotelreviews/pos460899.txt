the staff was very nice and super attentive lucas was especially helpful as we had been traveling several weeks already and had lots of bags that were pretty heavy he even told us where to go to purchase an inexpensive extra suitcase in fact he offered to go pick it up as well when we checked out he made sure the office knew when to prepare our bill and the doorman when to get a cab tony the doorman was super friendly and great as well
