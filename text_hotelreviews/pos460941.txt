this is by far the best hotel in the world and i have stayed in many the staff were absolutely fabulous there s nothing they couldn t do from start to finish the whole experience was perfect and so was the champagne i took my mother here for her birthday and the wonderful staff catered to our every need we stayed for nights in the junior suite floor and the slight view we had of the thames was wonderful i would also recommend when choosing a cocktail ask for the pop up cocktail book and try a grey goose tipple i can t remember the name i had a few too many only a few minutes walk from trafalgar square and the national gallery and a mile away from regent street perfect location
