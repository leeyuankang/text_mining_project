we booked a family room with two double beds and the room was much larger than i would have expected my daughter was literally able to do cartwheels in it everything was very clean and the beds super comfortable it s only a hundred metres or so from the tube station piccadilly line so a direct train from the airport the staff were super friendly and the breakfast was fantastic
