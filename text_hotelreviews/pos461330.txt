enjoyed our stay at this hotel arrived early and were able to check in this being which was great staff at reception were very helpful and welcoming room was nice and clean and bed was really comfortable only thing i would say about the room the carpet was a little dated couldn t of asked for a better location bang in the middle of mayfair itself local to trains and bus services lots of lovely shops in the surrounding area and only mins walk to regent street and oxford street only thing i was disappointed with in the hotel was that the breakfast was too expensive literally mins walk away there was a fab place fo eat called henrys cafe bar which cooked the best breakfast full english for including tea or coffee so definitely worth eating of a morning in there there is lots of lovely restaurants in the surrounding area we ate at hakasan mayfair also mr fogs residence for afternoon tea back to the mayfair hotel i would most certainly stay there again in the future
