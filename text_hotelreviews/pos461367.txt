the whole experience was great although an upmarket hotel you were still made to feel normal and not out of place for us this was a treat for our anniversary when we booked in we were told that we d been upgraded and when we got to the room there was a bottle of champagne strawberries and chocolate on the table it really made our day the room was big enough comfortable light and airy the bathroom dressing room took our breath away it was huge with his and her sinks a bath with a tv on it which i took full advantage of and plenty of hanging space and drawers for your items the staff at reception were very polite and took their time to explain everything breakfast options were fab you could choose from a hot menu and also anything at the buffet stations for the money and quality it is worth it the location is great aswell as you are in walking distance of most attractions and shops and also the tube station
