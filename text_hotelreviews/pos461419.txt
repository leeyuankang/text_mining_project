everything the room was nice and spacious as we got upgraded to a room with lots of light and a beautiful view of berkeley street the staff were very welcoming and accommodating and i can honestly say we were very spoiled the breakfast was delicious set in the beautiful mayfair kitchen with lots of variety and healthy options it was truly an exceptional experience and i look forward to coming back in the future
