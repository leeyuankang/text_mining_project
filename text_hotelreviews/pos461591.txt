the reception staff were lovely i turned up straight from work and probably didn t look as polished as most guests but my welcome was just the same which was refreshing my husband and i like to treat ourselves and make an effort to have a night together and find that some establishments judge you on appearance but very happy to report this was not the case at the may fair thank you we had a lovely stay
