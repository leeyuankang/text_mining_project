great location a stone s throw from warren street tube station and walk to euston booked a single room to stay over to join friends for a soho night out and have the convenience of getting to london st pancras the next morning room was clean and nicely decorated bathroom compact but clean and well stocked room had traffic noise as it was facing the front road so i called reception to ask to move rooms they sorted it straight away i explained i was in a rush to get ready to meet friends he told me to carry on getting ready and brought a new key for my quiet room which meant i could move my stuff when i had finished and dash straight out to the station great service free wifi and complimentary bottled water in rooms breakfast was included and was a good hot buffet staff efficient and smiled for under i felt like i had a good deal
