this is a lovely little hotel in a great location the staff are beyond helpful and professional they went out of their way to accommodate any request we stayed in two rooms we asked to be moved because i wanted a room with a bathtub both rooms were very spacious with a sitting area more like a junior suite than a standard room and both were well appointed the breakfast was quite good with a generous variety of foods it is an exceptional value for the money
