this property has preserved all of the amenities that hotels used to provide as a matter of course the staff is lovely the breakfasts are beautifully presented i was only here two nights but i enjoyed my stay even though i was staying in a single room whilst meeting up with my parents in austria old school glamour is how i would summarize my stay i am tired of design hotels and suspect that others are as well
