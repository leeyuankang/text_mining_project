the staff were friendly and helpful the bed was comfortable the room was quiet and nicely furnished the breakfast was delicious the restaurant food was good the location was good and the price was reasonable plus the hotel has an interesting history it s not modern or trendy but it was a very nice place to stay there was nothing we didn t like and vienna was wonderful we loved it and you can walk easily from the stefanie to anywhere in the historic centre of vienna and once you ve tired yourself out from the day s exploring you can catch a tram back to the bridge and it s just a short walk back to the hotel
