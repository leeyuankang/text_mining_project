very restful hotel no extraneous noise just outside the tourist area with a short simple walk into that access to metro was convenient and easy to use also very cheap and can be used to visit the more remote sites quickly others who used the bus facility were sometimes held up in traffic areas were always clean and staff very helpful there were never any noisy nights or early morning door bangs or plumbing noises
