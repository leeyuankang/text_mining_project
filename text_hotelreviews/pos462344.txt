beautiful old style hotel individual feel rather than a corporate chain great sense of history and some beautiful objects on display in the public rooms fantastic breakfast quieter location than the old part of the city across the bridge if you ask for it they provide tea and coffee making facilities quiet in the room until the last two nights when there was a guest next door who had the television very loud all night unfortunately the hotel did not deal with the problem despite repeated requests
