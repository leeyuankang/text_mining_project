the hotel was very cozy staff was extraordinary pleasant and friendly helped when needed patient attraction promoters and good advises the location is excellent for those who looking for a bit of silence during the evening and night but although close enough to the u bahn which will take you everywhere in the city just meters away the breakfast lack some variety from the main meal but the things offered was enough and tasty lots of bread variety lots of dessert variety there is a little and cozy bar just in front of the hotel bank stores pharmacies tobacco and liquor stores at a walking distance it s just like living in the middle of a tourist area but without the noise and crowdedness
