staff were extremely friendly and helpful the breakfast was excellent with lots of hot and cold choice and good quality ingredients a tea coffee tray is provided in your room if you request it there was a very small problem with the bathroom radiator which they fixed as quickly as possible with no distress or hassle to us the hotel then provided us with complimentary chocolates and wine and deducted some money from our bill without request cannot fault them the room was a very good size with comfortable beds the bathroom was also very nicely done with a walk in shower the hotel is a short walk from the main shopping area but this really was negligible and it was snowing when we were there they also recommended an excellent restaurant nearby serving local food at very reasonable prices i and my family would definitely stay here again
