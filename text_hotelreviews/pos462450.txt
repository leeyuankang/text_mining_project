spent a week in the hotel an older variety of hotel however that took nothing away and it is full of character the staff are brilliant always helpful and friendly the rooms themselves lack for nothing and anything extra you may require is provided immediately it is well placed within the city near the city centre but not too near the breakfasts with their full range will ensure you are ready to begin your sightseeing treks extremely good value for money were we to stay in the city again we d definitely use this hotel ps if you need to get about the city from site to site and don t have a lot of time use the excellent underground system which is far quicker than anything on the roads
