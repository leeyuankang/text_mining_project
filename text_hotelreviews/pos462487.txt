the location is very good close to metro lines and trams to tourist attractions it is also close to the boat station to bratislava in slovakia for a nice side trip the hotel lobby cafe and restaurant just provide a great atmosphere of the old world the decoration antique collections and staff uniform all exceed our expectations for a hotel of this price range the hotel staff are very nice and helpful we booked a double bed room the hotel had some problems with the availability of the room and they generously upgraded our room to a suite free of charge we greatly appreciate it the hotel laundry price is beyond our budget it may be ok for business travelers however with the convenient location we can still go to a self served laundry at favoritenstra e greenandclean laundry the laundry is near the main train station however the metro line can go there easily
