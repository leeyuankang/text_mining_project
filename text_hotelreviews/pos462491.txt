staff were really friendly and accommodating the room had a lovely spacious feel and bed was very comfy breakfast was really tasty with a great selection to choose from and the outdoor restaurant area is beautiful location was great the rooms are not equipped with an iron or ironing board and i totally understand the safety reasons behind this therefore guests need to go to the staff service laundry room to do any ironing just a note to keep in mind
