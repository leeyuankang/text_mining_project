the location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the old town on foot being a minute walk away we were made to feel very welcome as soon as we walked through the door we had one of the newly refurbished rooms which was nice the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean there was a large selection of food at breakfast
