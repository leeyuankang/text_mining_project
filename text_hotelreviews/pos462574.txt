this is a terrible place by no means a star hotel i mean just look at the towels which should have been thrown away ages ago the reception staff weren t any better i had to wait for more than an hour because my room was not ready the receptionist phoned me one day asking me to turn the tv volume down because my neighbour couldn t sleep i said i could barely hear it and he could come up and listen for himself he apparently trusts the neighbour s judgement and i said i d be leaving in protest certainly he said your bill is ready he was using me because i paid a non refundable price i left two days before the end of my e booking with booking com and he charged me the full price eu if booking com could help i welcome a refund of the last two days it s not fair although i was glad to get the hell out of that terrible place please complain to the administration of the hotel and advise your customers not to go anywhere near it
