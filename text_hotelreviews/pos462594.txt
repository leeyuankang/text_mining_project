the stefanie has a strong even slightly olde world focus on guest service but its olde world in a very nice way the room we were placed in was five star so were the breakfasts and bar meals and service we were also impressed by the level of premises upkeep which maintains this older hotel to a very high standard this was our best hotel stay during a tour over three months that included hotels in the uk the netherlands austria and germany all of the hotels we experienced were more than acceptable most were very good but the stefanie was the stand out
