hands down a luxury hotel decorated as to recall the class and grace of a bygone era delicious breakfast with lots of choices friendly helpful staff who spoke excellent english lots to do and see nearby and walking distance to a main subway stop would absolutely recommend hs to anyone and would stay here again if i ever come back to vienna
