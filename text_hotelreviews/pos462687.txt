the breakfast spread was one of the most amazing i have ever seen the rooms were a little cosy but adequate with quality bathrooms and strong wifi the inside of the building itself was sprawling and quite impressive the heat in vienna at the time was stifling but the air conditioning throughout the building and rooms was fantastic the hotel is located sufficiently near to a metro is quite close to the river and is not too far from the city centre the takeaway breakfast option upon early checkout was generous and much appreciated
