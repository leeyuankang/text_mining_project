our trip was for a wedding anniversery visit to the theatre and as soon as the staff found out we were given a free glass of champagne each in the bar which was very nice and a big bowl of fruit which did us for breakfast along with a charming hand written card the room was very chic and overlooked the thames and we were within easy walking distance of our theatre we will be back without doubt no more rushing or hanging around for late night trains
