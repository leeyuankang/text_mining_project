stayed here last year four four nights at which time they kindly upgraded us to a junior suite which was fabulous stayed this time one night in a classic room no upgrade this time so we paid an extra for an executive room this made the price of our room nearly for the night location the best executive lounge disappointing this time waiting around awhile for service and ended up getting things ourselves as other did the reception staff are outstanding so friendly
