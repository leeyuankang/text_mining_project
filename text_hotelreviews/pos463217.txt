the hotel was very comfortable wonderfully located and their offer of a free upgrade made it even more special the staff were all friendly and helpful and it made our theatre weekend really special breakfast was also quite good a particular thank you for the calm reassuring way that the reception and concierge staff handled the news about the london bridge attack our visit was during that weekend we felt well informed and safe
