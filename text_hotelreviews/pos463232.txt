visited london to celebrate my birthday hotel very central for the theatres tour buses underground etc we upgraded to a suite on arrival and it was lovely mini bar being free was a wonderful bonus and the free use of the amba bar for breakfast and free drinks and refreshments during the day was superb and makes booking an executive room worth the money however the absolute joy of this hotel is it s staff wonderfully polite helpful smiley people who were a pleasure to be around noah in the amba bar was a particular joy and his smile always made my day start well thank you all we will return and we would fully recommend this hotel
