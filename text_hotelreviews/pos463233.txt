this was the second time we stayed at the hotel and loved it again this time we had an executive room with lounge access the lounge was a nice bonus with free breakfast great selection and free drinks and snacks throughout the day the bed was really comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet facing the inner court towards the train station could not hear any trains to the floor location is the best you can get in london all in all a great hotel
