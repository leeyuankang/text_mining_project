stuff was really excellent friendliest stuff ever not even sheraton and hyatt can keep up with this guys check in process very fast had an executive king room unfortunately no street view to the strand very clean and comfortable but that s ok most of the time i was off for business or shopping everything is in a very good walking distance i had a perfect stay and highly recommend this beautiful hotel
