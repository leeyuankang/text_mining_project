i booked the room of this hotel from booking com and stayed here for days during our trip in london the location is so awesome that the majority of attractions could be reached within mins by tube or even by walk the stuff of this hotel is professional as well especially a waiter rico who is not only approachable polite and assist us a lot during our stays when it comes to the room the one we stayed was so clean spacious and comfortable that it is hard to believe this hotel has already opened for years to sum up this is a hotel that we would like to visit again in the future
