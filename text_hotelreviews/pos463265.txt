the staff couldn t be any more polite helpful and friendly and always go the extra mile to make sure our stay is first class the hotel room itself is spotless clean comfortable and gives and very homely feel the shower is fabulous we love this hotel because of its central location and within walking distance of many central london attractions shops bars and restaurants and very easy to get to by taxi from euston station it is the little things i notice every time i stay in this hotel like how at least one person on front reception will always greet you when entering or leaving the hotel which all adds to making a stay here that little more special we ate breakfast during our last stay and this is a buffet style full english with a selection of cereals toast fruit etc and very good value for money having stayed at this hotel a number of times i would highly recommend to anyone if they are looking for a special place to stay whilst visiting central london
