location location location great staff would recommend the room upgrade for use of the executive lounge with complimentary coffee and soft and alcoholic refreshments beautiful building very nice to have a complimentary fridge in room which was restocked for free throughout our stay great price overall for london and this hotel had lots of nice little touches to make it stand out i will definitely return and recommend to family and friends
