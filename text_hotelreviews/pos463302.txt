the size of the room was bigger than most london city centre hotels the complimentary items in the minibar especially the fresh milk for tea and coffee was a very considerate touch the beds are luxuriously comfortable and the very modern bathroom which was absolutely spotless offered ample toiletries which are topped up daily the walk in shower was extremely powerful and the underfloor heating was a bonus
