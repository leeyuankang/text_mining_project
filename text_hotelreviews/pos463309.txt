the bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding and pillows perfect the room was a standard double and i was on my own it might be considered a little too cosy for a couple i liked the complimentary minibar and the coffee machine was great i had difficulty working it to begin with and i wonder how non british people manage with the english instructions the television too was complicated for me to work but i managed eventually as for the tablet i ignored it so it went unused i am and not too familiar with modern technology the bathroom was spotless and the shower simple to work
