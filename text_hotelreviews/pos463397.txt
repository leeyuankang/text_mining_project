jennifer checked me in and i mentioned i was in london as i was having a small eye op when i returned from the hospital there was a personally written card saying that she hoped the op went well and if i needed anything to contact reception i travel for work and stay in five star hotels all over the world i have never had such a personalised service and will be recomending this hotel to everyone i know the room breakfast etc were also very good but these things are very good in many hotels so uthe service adds an extra dimension
