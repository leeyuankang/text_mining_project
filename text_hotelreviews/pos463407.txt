we loved the welcome we received from the staff everyone was fabulous the whole time we were there they were attentive welcoming and friendly and remembered that we told them it was my sisters birthday while we were there we came back from the theatre on the birthday night to find a birthday card a bottle of champagne a birthday cake and some chocolates how fantastic was that we loved the place which has just been renovated and also used the amba lounge one evening before going out
