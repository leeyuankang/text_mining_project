staff always smiled which makes me feel good no waiting at reception for check in or out which makes arrival and departure a pleasure so nice to be given a few snacks and water etc in the mini bar instead of being made to feel like a cash cow for the smallest thing i would definitely recommend this note thel location could not have been better i left my watch which was duly collected and put in the safe for my friend to collect the day after my departure no fuss just great service
