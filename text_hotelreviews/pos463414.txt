my husband and i stayed here on the london leg of our honeymoon trip the staff was so friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable the concierge was also very helpful in making reservations for dinner and arranging transportation the room offered great views of the city and a very comfortable bed the minibar is also all complimentary which was an added bonus
