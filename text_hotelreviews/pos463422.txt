the staff were amazing the extras provided complimentary were incredible this hotel should be the standard others aspire to be hotel bar restaurant room communal areas all very welcoming and comfortable definitely worth upgrading to executive for all the extras location couldn t be better either right off trafalgar square next to charing cross station room was very quiet no external noise heard at all totally recommended
