we stayed there on the first night of our honeymoon before traveling everybody there was fantastic they decorated the room lovely and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne the room was spacious with an excellent view and you always judge a hotel by the shower which didn t disappoint we were catching a late flight the following day the staff let us check out later and stored our bags whilst we went for a wonder we picked the hotel as we were watching the fawlty towers dining experience which we also highly recommend
