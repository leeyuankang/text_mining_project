perfect location really clean lovely staff we were worried about the noise from the train station below but we couldn t hear a thing we went for the executive double room which was a good size but wasn t expecting all the bits to come with it fridge with soft and alcoholic drinks coffee machine access to lounge where you can get a drink coffee and light snack during the day and also a breakfast in the morning all that included in the cost of the room brilliant deal there is also a restaurant but we didn t use that the room was good size bed was so comfy that we didnt want to get out of there in the morning very clean just perfect for what we wanted we have stayed in number of hotel in london and none of them were as good as this one highly recommend to anyone
