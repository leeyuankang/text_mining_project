i arranged a trip to london for my boyfriends birthday and we were both very pleased with our stay at amba hotel it s central location is perfect we even had a view of the thames and the shard the staff made us feel very welcome upon arrival and we were offered fresh juice i had informed the hotel of the birthday celebrations and we were greeted with a bottle of bubbles with a personalised card and cake in our room we made good use of the nespresso machine in our room as we did the ipad i enjoyed a cocktail in the bar pricey but very nice i can t imagine wanting to book another hotel on our return to london
