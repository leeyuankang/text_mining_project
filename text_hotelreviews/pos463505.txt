this was by far the best hotel we ve ever stayed in out of very many worldwide some of them were at the same stars and price level and also in the centre of london so it s a fair comparison apart from the friendly attitude we received from every member of staff be it the concierge or the cleaner and the lovely and spacious room there were many things about that were thoughtfully place to make us feel at comfortable and we felt very pampered throughout our stay it was definitely worth every penny and we hope to be back again
