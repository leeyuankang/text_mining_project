we had a really lovely stay at the amba hotel the staff were amazing very informative about the surrounding area and they were very observant too the lovely young lady who checked us in asked if there was a reason for our visit and i explained that we were celebrating my husbands and my birthdays as they both are in september and then a bit later on a lovely gentleman arrived at our room with the most delicious chocolate dessert and a bottle of champagne on ice totally unexpected and such a lovely surprise things like this go a long way the fact that the lady on reception took notice there was a lovely birthday card too written by the reception staff the breakfast was delicious too and there was smoked salmon available as part of the buffet unfortunately i didn t see this until after i had my breakfast but my own fault for not investigating all the options such a fantastic weekend and we will definitely be back
