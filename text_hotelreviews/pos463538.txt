nice breakfast options and location most hotels are high prices in london but this was my second time there and i would stay here again if you want quiet this hotel is in a busy street so maybe not your best option however for me i liked the fact it was near the train and underground located near soho theatre covent gardens and piccadilly all within walking distance a good choice free internet enjoy
