the hotel is beautiful and in a great location an oasis in a very busy area i stayed nights in the buckingham wing which was less glamorous than the main building but still well appointed my request for a room on a higher floor was honoured and i loved that the windows opened for fresh air the staff were extremely friendly and helpful
