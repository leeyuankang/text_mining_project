the bed is super comfortable like at resort hotels we had executive room so it was large and bright the breakfast could have a bit more variety though as for london is very good quality staff is very attentive and accommodating location is brilliant as you can easily walk towards big ben house of parliament westminster abbey london eye buckingham palace covent garden soho basically everything is at your doorsteps
