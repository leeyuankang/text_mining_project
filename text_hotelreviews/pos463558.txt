we were grandparents with two of our grandchildren we felt happy and relaxed at the hotel the staff were pleasant and helpful at all times and welcoming to the children the breakfast was full of choice and delicious our rooms were clean well equipped and comfortable being offered water to take out with us was a bonus too the hotel is in a good location to walk to a lot of places and was only a stroll away from the theatres we liked many things about the hotel and will be back
