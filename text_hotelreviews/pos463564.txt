we loved this hotel which i thought was luxurious without being ostentatious and our highlights were arriving to find a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate truffles in our room having mentioned that we were in london to celebrate my husband s birthday and our wedding anniversary both on the same day the absolutely first class location on the strand next to trafalgar square the lovely spacious room with all our favourite little luxuries including fresh milk in the complimentary mini bar a nespresso coffee machine great shower cosy bed with crisp white linen free wifi the super friendly staff the delicious breakfast we paid a little more than we would normally do as this was a special occasion but we are really glad we did and hope to return highly recommended
