we stayed at the amba charing cross for ten nights in july and we would return in a heartbeat i have never experienced a hotel staff as friendly and helpful as that of the amba charing cross at check in we were offered a glass of bubbly and the celebratory atmosphere was a constant throughout our stay it s hard to imagine a more perfectly managed hotel each afternoon or early evening staff came to our room to ensure that we had everything that we needed our room was large and well appointed with a complimentary mini bar laptop and perfect hypnos mattress the bathroom was modern and beautifully appointed with a glass shower as well as a great soaker tub there was plenty of storage and it felt good to unpack and find room for everything we paid an additional gbp for an upgrade that included an upgraded room complete breakfast and free drinks in the amba lounge in the early evening breakfast in the lovely conservatory overlooking the strand and st martin s was good and the service was excellent the amba charing cross is extremely well located for walking to trafalgar square covent garden westminster the south bank and even as far as st paul s rail connections charing cross and waterloo in particular are excellent tube connections charing cross and embankment stations couldn t be better great restaurants within a five minute walking distance abound finally one of the things we most appreciated was the inclusiveness of the price we never felt nickeled and dimed i m not sure what the british equivalent to that expression is we have stayed at a number of great hotels in central london this was our hands down favourite
