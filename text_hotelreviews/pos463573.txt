the location was outstanding literally right next door to the charing cross tube station and steps away from trafalgar square we were several long blocks away from westminster and leicester square this hotel was centrally located to everything every staff member that we came in contact with was courteous and amazingly helpful the bathroom was large and the walk in shower with detachable shower head was wonderful comfy robes were provided and so was a coffee maker
