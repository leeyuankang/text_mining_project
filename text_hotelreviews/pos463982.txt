locatoin is superb a few minutes to metro station and even closer to hop on off bus stops and a very nice cafe which serves great draft beers the gesture demonstrated by the whole hotel ie offering complentary sparkling wine and half price in lobby bar for constrution site next to hotel which creates some noice which overall is managable
