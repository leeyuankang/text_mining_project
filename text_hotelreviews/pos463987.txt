the location of the hotel was perfect for all that vienna had to offermand only about euros in a taxi from the train station if you catch the airport express train the spanish horse school and a variety of museums were very close by and many restaurants to choose from in the evening as the hotel didn t serve evening meals the hotel was completely full but still very quiet and relaxed atmosphere the breakfast which we hadn t realized was included in the price was excellent with a good variety on offer and set us up for the day the breakfast room staff were friendly and welcoming especially sairene who was particularly helpful the coffee was perfect all in all a great experience and would stay again
