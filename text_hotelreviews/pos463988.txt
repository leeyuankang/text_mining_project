hotel das tigra lies in a quiet street in vienna currently they are building a new apartment complex just across the street this means that workers arrive around when the windows are closed it will not bother you however the hotel has also supplied some foam ear pieces which i didn t have to use be aware that the hotel is not very close to the subway it is about a minute walk to the nearest station for me this is fine no problem i actually like that the hotel is a bit away from the crowd i have stayed here many times and it is always a pleasure the staff is always very kind without exception to put it simply this is my no choice when traveling to vienna
