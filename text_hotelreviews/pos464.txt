excellent hotel in every aspect fantastic location with only a minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central london rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom all the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone
