we stayed at this hotel for three nights superior double room though not the most modern hotel i ve ever seen i was incredibly impressed with the room layout and storage space it s rare to see such a well thought out and functional room these days but hotel das tigra hit all the right marks with the ample amount of shelves tabletops electrical sockets and wall hangers the room was extremely clean with excellent wifi we didn t try the breakfast so cannot comment on that the staff were friendly and the hotel was situated in a pretty central location around mins walk to the city centre mins ride to the train station and around mins from the airport the staff were friendly and helpful we were very happy with our choice and would choose to stay here again next time
