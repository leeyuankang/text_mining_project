very friendly and helpful staff comfortable sitting area in lobby and within walking distance to the main sights short walk about one block to local cafes restaurants there are more central hotels but this represented excellent value for being in near proximity please note there is no restaurant onsite and public areas limited to a small bar and lobby great base for sightseeing several lifts to all floors rooms are spacious and modern and up to date bathrooms with walk in showers no views of course being a city hotel would definitely use again
