the hotel was centrally located in downtown vienna easy walking distance to many of the sights and the u bahn stations there is construction going on across the street from the hotel resulting in increased noise levels in the hotel room during working hours however the hotel recognized this inconvenience and provided earplugs in the room as well as off at the hotel bar
