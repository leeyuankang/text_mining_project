the location was really great only a few mins walk away from the main sights so especially helpful when we only had a short stay the breakfast had a huge range of food and the rooms were really modern and clean making the trip feel like a proper weekend away when we come back to vienna we will definitely be staying there again ps we loved the viennese chocolates that were left for us on arrival a small touch but a tasty one
