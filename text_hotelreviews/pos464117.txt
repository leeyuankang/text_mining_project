hotel was well appointed and in a great location in the first district yet tucked away from all the bustle of the graben convenient to u bahn and to local restaurants breakfasts were excellent with the personal requests for soft boiled eggs etc available all the staff were friendly and accommodating would definitely stay here again we had lived in vienna for years and have returned often staying in a variety of places in different districts but this is the one we would return to
