although a little tricky to find this hotel is pretty well located and not a long walk from tourist attractions and the main shopping area the service provided by staff was very good professional and helpful the rooms are well appointed and quite large in size windows open to allow fresh air into the room wifi coverage is excellent had breakfast included in our room rate and this was very good not a massive array of food but enough to provide you with a good filling breakfast i was a bit reluctant to stay here being best western but was very impressed overall by this hotel would definitely stay here again
