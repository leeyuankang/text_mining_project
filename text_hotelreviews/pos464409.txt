the manager simon was amazing took customer service to another level there was some confusion about us having breakfast as part of our booking or not the front desk staff were quite abrupt however simon came and saved the day and sorted our breakfast out we also requested a cot which simon came and set up for us including fitting the bedding etc he then got us several bottles of water the final bit that made us give simon stars was he arrange for someone to go and purchase lacto free milk and had it bought up to our room in morning we think this was pretty amazing and beyond our expectations
