great location lots of nearby restaurants and bars hotel does not serve alcohol however there is a sainsbury s opposite and a fridge provided in the room with glasses if you really can t go without there are so many bars within a minute or two s walk away that it did not matter at all comfy bedroom with everything you need including good air con which actually works well and a bathroom which has space unusual for london breakfast was excellent i can highly recommend the eggs royale and staff were friendly and courteous they do not serve pork products either but my husband loved the chicken herb sausages and turkey rashers instead within walking distance to tower bridge st catherine s dock area and borough tube for access to central london would definitely recommend and would stay again
