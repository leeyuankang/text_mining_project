the position of the hotel is just great walking distance from london bridge shard borough market etc and very well connected also by bus for example to go to london waterloo the area is very pretty with lots of local coffee shops restaurant and trendy pubs despite the area it is not noisy and pretty well isolated being located in a tiny nice square where on friday and saturday mornings there is a small market the room is very well furnished with also a small beauty area hairdryer nice and wide mirror with led lights big bathroom and good wifi connection we did not try the breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of coffee shops in the area one just on the corner in front of the hotel where you can have great coffee and food
