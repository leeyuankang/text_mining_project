great location minute walk from london bridge station hotel very quiet and surrounded by lots of unique businesses except sainsbury s across the road try the coffee shop right next door didn t use the hotel for food so can t comment on this i m not sure boutique is a description i would use for the hotel but all the same it has some quirkiness about it would definitely stay again without hesitation
