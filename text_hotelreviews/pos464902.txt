the location was perfect for us just a short walk from london bridge tube i was travelling with my year old daughter and distance was easily manageable for her staff were very friendly especially john in the kitchen and marcus in reception they serve free tea and coffee downstairs from rooms are lovely and the showers are fantastic it is a dry hotel so no alcohol served suited me as i was there with my little girl although they do allow you to bring alcohol in from sainsburys opposite and there is a fridge and wine glasses in the rooms
