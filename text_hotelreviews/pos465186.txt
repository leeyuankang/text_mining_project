the property located in a very nice area with a lot of modern buildings and nice small pond nearby also the subway station is in minutes walk from the property the whole area near the hotel is so quiet and peaceful good choice for people who wants to stay far from crowdy centre streets but it takes only minutes by train to get to the city centre the staff was very friendly and careful the room was clean and modern everything was great hope to visit it more in future
