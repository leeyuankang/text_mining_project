what could you expect fro marriott good hotel relatively good location very close to the station and very quiet and safe around it takes about ten mins or even less to get to city centre if you get off at universitat station the room was spacious and clean pretty nice view from the room we had the double bedroom didn t take any breakfast in the hotel as it was rather expensive euros per person when you can spend about euros only in the city for both
