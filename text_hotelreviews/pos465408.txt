we stayed here as we ve ben to this hotel before the location is great if you re there for the football and the view from our room overlooked the stadium breathtaking views at night staff were lovely everything was really clean good sized rooms the bar was a nice friendly place to have a drink and not too pricey either smashing little hotel
