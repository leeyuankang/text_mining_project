our stay in vienna was enhanced by staying at this hotel it had everything we were looking for in spite of temperatures over the air conditioning made the room pleasant in an instant we were on the floor and did not get disturbed with any noises could barely make out the tram that passed beside the hotel the king size bed was divine the fittings luxurious the minibar was useful to cool our own drinks and fruit top marks for the pool which was the highlight at the end of a hot day in town although small metres long it was never too full as people took their turn there were ample loungers around the pool and also in the large garden together with tables and chairs and parasols the poolside staff catered to all your needs and delivered drinks and coffee cake which was only euro very reasonable on the other side of the hotel the garden was used as an extension of the restaurant we were able to breakfast outdoor under the trees a great pleasure or in the conservatory breakfast was on until every day which allowed me to go for a leisurely swim first at night there was entertainment in their city garden once or twice a week our favourite hang out at night was the salm brau microbrewery right beside the entrance to the belvedere gardens about mins from the hotel their rustic courtyard restaurant was always busy and they served food until if busy there is always room indoor as we found out when we were looking for a bite to eat after a late concert one night it was very convenient to get to the hotel train to rennweg station and luckily we took the right exit that brought us up right next door to the hotel trains to and from the airport are every half hour we found public transport very well organised vast underground passes which made it easy to travel across the city
