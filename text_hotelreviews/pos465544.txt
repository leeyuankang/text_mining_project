breakfast quality and selection was beyond expectations and were able to accommodate healthy and not so healthy desires the room rate was relatively fair to other accommodation options in vienna however not in located in the city centre the proximity of the botanical gardens and belvedere offers a great walk and time off right around the corner the hotel lobby is offering a nice hang off place for short time breaks as well as the maintained garden for even sunbathing between visiting attractions
