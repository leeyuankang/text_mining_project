a fairly modern impersonal hotel minutes walk from vienna centre ok if you don t mind walking had a nice garden area if you wanted to sit outside the staff were helpful but i had to become a member of marriott hotel s loyalty scheme to get free wifi which shouldn t be necessary in this type of hotel breakfast was good and plenty of options and staff dealt with wifi queries well
