breakfast is really good with quite a variety to choose from dinner menu was delicious we especially enjoyed the potato soup my husband liked it so much for three nights in a row that the waitress asked the chef for the recipe and he wrote it down for us salsa night was entertaining at the hotel one of the highlights was attending the mozart strauss concert at the kursalon wien the opera singers ballet dancers and orchestra was fabulous visiting the castles is a history highlight
