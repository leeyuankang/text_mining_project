i chose a twin club room with lounge access as i was travelling with my year old mother so knew we would probably spend a fair amount of time in the hotel between trips the room was spacious and the beds were really comfortable access to the lounge with its numerous snacks and drinks was fabulous the staff were very friendly and helpful
