the breakfast was tremendous so much variety and very good quality we used this as our main meal of the day and just topped up with kaffe und kuchen in vienna s many coffee shops ideal staff are friendly helpful and courteous particularly at the front desk and in the bar restaurants the location is excellent right next to rennweg train station and lots of tram stops so getting around the city was a breeze
