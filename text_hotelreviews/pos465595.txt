the hotel is in a very good location just next to a train station and a few minutes by walk from the city centre the facilities are really good and include sauna pool gym and a marvellous lounge the rooms are really big and the beds are super comfortable the hotel restaurant has good dishes and there are quite a lot of good restaurants around all in all it we were really pleased with the experience
