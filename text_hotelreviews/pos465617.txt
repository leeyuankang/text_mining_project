lovely hotel in good quiet location only stops on tram to the city centre staff were all polite and helpful at all times we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and had access to the lounge with drinks and snacks included marvellous riesling excellent choice at breakfast and great cocktails at the bar would definitely recommend and stay again
