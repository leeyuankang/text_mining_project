we arrived late in the evening the reception staff were excellent the studio room was spacious had everything you could want for an extended stay easy access either by tram metro or on foot to must see attractions special thanks to mr sharma who suggested an upgrade from b sic to superior studio well worth the small extra payment to have opening windows city view would definitely recommend this hotel to others
