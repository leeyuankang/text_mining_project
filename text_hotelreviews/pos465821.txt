me and my wife stayed in vienna for days the room was good for our stay we actually booked the superior studio because we wanted windows that can be opened the small kitchen had everything you needed and the dishwasher was nice to have we didn t get any breakfast there the location is excellent in our opinion we had a billa supermarket metro station bike stands and the danube all within minutes of walking the city center is also very close it s a bit noisy but the windows muffle the sound pretty well we tried wiring the tv to our laptop to watch some movies but we didn t have an hdmi hdmi wire and the hotel didn t help us either the tv itself was too old to know how to read an external hard drive by itself
