the location of the hotel was ok although it is on the outer limits of the city center so plan on walking quite a lot unless you prefer subways but then you don t enjoy the city as much from the hotel to stephansdom it takes around minutes at a brisk pace so if you re going to the rathouse for example plan on a minute walk back again the subway is very close as well as the trams that go along the ring so that it also an option if you are tired i prefer walking so would have appreciated a location a bit closer to the center the facilities are ok very clean and the kitchen has everything we didn t use it though
