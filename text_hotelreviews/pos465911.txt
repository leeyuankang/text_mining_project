i liked that there was a small gym and sauna and a laundry room should you need to do a load or two i didn t use the gym facilities but did monopolize the washers and dryers knowing that these are here may help some when considering just how much clothes you really need i liked that there was a small kitchen as well but with all the terrific food out in town i wouldn t have even thought about cooking it s a good location to use as your base camp the trains and subways are close but the ability to walk around the city can t be beat despite the cold in march i am glad i toured by foot staff were the friendliest people around and were available do not hesitate to stay here plus the rooms are good sizes compared to other hotels in europe i would stay here again is the best compliment i can pay
