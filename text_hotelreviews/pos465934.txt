reading prior comments i was worried about my hotel choice but we were amazed with our room studio the most cheap option in this hotel very kind and polite people at reception lovely room with enough space great equipped not that warm you can change temperature as you wish but the best thing is location just in front of the hotel there is a tram station that is great connected u bahn is far away and st stephan cathedral you can reach in minutes supermarket bakery and fast food shop are far away we totally loved it
