alejandro who was on reception went above and beyond to assist when one of our rooms was very unsatisfactory and found another more suitable room immediately he provided us with a map marking all the places we should visit and what to avoid which was very helpful and he also very kindly recommended an excellent local restaurant to us on our last night there was free coffee in reception breakfast was very filling and showers very good
