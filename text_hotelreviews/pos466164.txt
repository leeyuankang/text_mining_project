the hotel staff were amazing they could not have been more friendly or welcoming without being pushy the arrival drinks and bar vouchers were a really nice touch i would recommend the white wine the location of this hotel is perfect so easy to walk around the city but also right next to the metro to get to the beach hundreds of great bars and restaurants nearby to suit all price ranges yummy crepes minutes down the road and within you can be on la rambla do was extra special with delicious food for our anniversary meal barcelona has something for everyone food art culture watersports nightlife and this hotel makes it so easy to find what you re looking for it is part of the chain but it feels like an independent because the staff are so personable and invested in you having a good stay
