the hotel is nice it s not knock out or amazing but it is new clean and modern we didn t bother with breakfast as the hotel is so central that it felt a shame to have another generic breakfast when there s so much to choose from just a few minutes walk from the hotel everything about the hotel is fine but i think i was hoping for a bit more at that price point
