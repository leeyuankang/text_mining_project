i loved the roof top bar i did not try the little pool but people were sunbathing and enjoying the sun it is a great place for lunch or a drink the breakfast room was quiet and the service was good it was my birthday and they brought me a surprise sparkling wine and cake so the staff takes notice of things like that via laietana is a noisy busy street but close to shopping restaurants metro stations etc i would book a room on a higher floor preferably facing from laietana if possible the terraza upgrade is worth the money
