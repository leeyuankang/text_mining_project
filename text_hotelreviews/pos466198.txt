the room was quite spacious for two people and the bathroom was actually extra large which was nice there was absolutely no noise from other rooms or the street unless you opened the window we went to the palau de la musica and it was literally a stone s throw away which was great the airport bus is a quick walk away as is the subway we didn t really visit any restaurants around there but i saw a few that looked good hotel staff were attentive and friendly the offered welcome drink and chocolates plus other sweets at reception were a nice touch the rooftop bar was also very nice for a view of the city at sunset we didn t use the pool but it looked inviting wifi in the room was easy and quick and we appreciated the nespresso machine for our morning coffees
