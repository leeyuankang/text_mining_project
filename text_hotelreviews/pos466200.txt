we were celebrating my partners birthday and can t think of anywhere better to have done so to start with the staff brought complimentary cava and cake to our room as a gift from the hotel which was completely unexpected the hotel is placed perfectly in easy reach of everything the roof terrace and pool area is unbelievable offering and unparalleled view that you could never tire of the staff in the hotel were really friendly and no task was too small we can t recommend cubik highly enough we love barcelona and will definitely come back and stay at cubik again
