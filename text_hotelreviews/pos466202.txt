great central location close to the aerobus drop off at placa de catalunya quirky reception rooms and great terrace with bar at the top of the hotel the reception staff were most welcoming and went out of their way to be helpful even letting us use the computer to book tickets and print them out for breakfast there was a choice of hot and cold food which was beautifully presented
