a decent hotel for a short stay the rooms had good flooring plenty of space and full length windows the location is pretty good in terms of proximity to the main sites but this also meant that it s on a somewhat generic street you have to walk somewhere else to experience the city i didn t have the breakfast there were plenty of interesting options around the city staying here is absolutely fine for a short stay but we shouldn t pretend it s anything beyond a solid experience and for that i think it s slightly over priced
