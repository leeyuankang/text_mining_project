the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful and even gave us a free upgrade and lovely bottle of champagne with strawberries to celebrate our anniversary rooms were soundproofed so couldn t hear a peep from the outside despite being in the centre of barcelona was also extremely handy to have parking under the hotel would highly recommend
