the staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful without being too pushy or over familiar very professional the hotel is new and modern the room was clean and comfy with a nespresso machine nice touch the bathroom was quite large with a very modern feel we enjoyed some tapas and a complimentary drink in the atik bar where you can get a lovely view of barcelona
