amazing hotel fantastic central location mins from catalunya square and near shops and la rambles drink on arrival and free welcome drink on beautiful roof top bar overlooking city small pool not big enough to swim but good to cool down excellent breakfast mix of buffet and cooked options would definitely recommend
