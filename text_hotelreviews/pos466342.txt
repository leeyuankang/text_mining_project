basically a brand new hotel that was very well presented the quality of the finishes of both the room and the general hotel facilities were very impressive a very modern hotel the staff were amazing and were always friendly and helpful the hotel is located in a great spot whilst not located immediately close to anything amazing a lot of great things are within a minute walk or a couple of stops on the train
