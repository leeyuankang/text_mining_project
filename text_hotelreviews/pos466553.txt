small but cozy hotel with an excellent location on carrer de valencia a street where nice cafes local bars abound where going to a crawl through the purely local lifestyle was the best attraction for me but inquire hotel staff about opening hours mind siesta i appreciate friendliness of the staff enjoyed cleanliness of the breakfast place the breakfast itself is quite enough to kick start a good day though it may seem the hotel is a bit far from main attractions it is just mins walk away from great rambla de catalunya and passeig de gracia wide tourist streets leading to lots of famous places public transport is there metro is not in the immediate vicinity for some but just blocks away mins walk hospital clinic or universitat are the nearest stations my room on the floor was spacious with all necessary amenities in bathroom
