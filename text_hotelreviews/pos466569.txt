central location walking distance of several gaudi properties we felt safe on the streets at night although like any major city a need to be aware of opportunistic pickpockets in the major tourist areas excellent and very friendly and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble rooms were clean and spacious with good aircon all over the hotel the wifi generally worked well not more than in our room but signal did drop occasionally then again we booked for a holiday break and not streaming videos hotel bar was open until but the choice of bars many opening into the early hours were available within walking distance there was a good breakfast until with a reasonable choice of hot and cold food although not always piping hot cheery breakfast staff as well we had stayed in what would be considered a more upmarket hotel in barcelona a few days earlier the sunotel in my view though was a more pleasant experience all round my wife and i will definitely return
