the room was large and very clean the shower was excellent our view was quite good too the location of this hotel is brilliant within walking distance to great shops and la ramble there were lots of lovely restaurants and cafes all around which were all inexpensive but good quality food and drink my daughter and i would definitely recommend it and will be back we couldn t believe that we spent so little and had a brilliant holiday
