i didn t book the breakfast however i had it two times in four days some people on here have complained about the price but for cereal and or a cooked breakfast with toast coffees and juice followed by yogurt and a bowl of mixed fresh fruit it really is good value do your public transport homework buses and the metro are very easy get a transport pass and you can catch the bus around the corner to the beach for just euro per person and its about miles away the metro will take you to any of the tourist places and the beach if you are not so confident or have a bigger budget stand outside the hotel and flag a taxi down within seconds or so visit the son hao taiwanese restaurant at carrer de muntaner for the most amazing asian like chinese food available in my view in the whole of barcelona there are also fantastic italian and greek food within a minute walk its a nice slow minute walk to the centre of barcelona plaza catalonia but you can vary the walking route and window shop along the way plenty of spanish tapas bars etc nearby and some english irish pubs also i found at least three places selling craft beers including a brewdog pub just streets away from the sunotel club central which is legendary enjoy
