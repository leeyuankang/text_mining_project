first impression was how courteous all the front desk clerks were the ones working there the first day we arrived and all the other ones we met during our stay extremely helpful with directions to barcelona s top attractions they even use different color markers to match the subway line colors to get you to the destinations you want the room is well maintained but there is nothing extra special about it nor anything bad very generic but comfortable and clean the bed was a little bit soft to my taste and there was no choice of pillows for you to chose from a harder one to a softer one nevertheless it was still a comfortable and clean bed bathroom was also clean the free amenities are very basic just shampoo and bath gel the only problem in the bathroom is that the tub is higher than the bathroom floor and the tub border is pretty thick when stepping out of the shower you are actually stepping down if you don t realize it you can hurt yourself if you are short my fiancee has a huge purple bruise on her leg because of this we stayed in a room without breakfast so i can t review it at euros per person it is simply too expensive go across the street to a caf called honey operated by two friendly twin sisters offering simple but well made food that is fresh and made when you order all in all this was a good hotel where the good points outweigh the bad ones i would consider it more of a three star than a four star but in the end i would recommend it and would stay there again p s i don t know if its possible but i would like to see a pamphlet with instructions on how to change languages on the tv everything in spain is dubbed into spanish but i could see there were options to change languages as much as i tried i couldn t figure out how to do it if the hotel cable service offers the ability to change languages i would like to see them make it clear how to do it
