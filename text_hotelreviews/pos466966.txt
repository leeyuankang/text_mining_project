a superb hotel not cheap but amsterdam does not so cheap and still fairly nasty rather well the conservatorium is a startling and wonderful exception from the moment of being welcomed in through the doors through to friendly and helpful reception to the young man who showed us to our room it was all and i never thought i d see a room as good as this in amsterdam high style quietness comfort you name it didn t eat in so cannot comment on the food great location literally just round the corner from quality shops museums the city s greatest concert hall etc
