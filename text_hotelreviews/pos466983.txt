truly a beautiful property as i travel often this is the first i have seen of its kind kudos to the designers bit of old and new and the loft rooms are amazing f b offerings befit the property and the high level of shopping offered inside and around the property walking distance from the van gogh museum and a beautiful park to lay in the grass will definitely return door staff was very friendly and front desk staff definitely followed process and procedure lacked a bit of warmth but they are young
