the hotel was absolutely gorgeous and had a fantastic breakfast as well as a lovely pool and spa area massages were nice the rooms were huge and had very large windows story in my rooms because we were traveling for our honeymoon the hotel had delicious macarons waiting for us in the room at check in they also gave us a coupon for free glasses of champagne but for religious dietary reasons we were unable to use that the inclusion of a nespresso machine in each room was a nice touch i come from an espresso obsessed family but when we requested more intensely flavored pods and espresso cups our first room had no espresso cups it took over an hour to get those so we were already on our way out for the day by that point one manager was fantastic and made us feel extremely welcome the other one that we dealt with would not have been out of place in a road side holiday inn
