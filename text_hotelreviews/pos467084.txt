it was a really nice stay at nh amsterdam zuid the staff are extremely helpful and friendly with special thanks to roxanne who was very informative i just wished that the hotel had allowed early check in without a charge like most hotel especially since the room was already available very convenient mins walk to tram and metro which went into central and within walking distance to a new geraldplien shopping mall with lots of restaurants unfortunately we only discovered on our last day also within walking distance to amstel park which was great for kids
