it s a nice hotel in the centre of milan don t expect fancy interiors or exiting surroundings the hotel is very close min walk to the garibaldi train station so you can easily and quickly travel to malpensa airport for only it takes almost as much time as by taxi which costs more than only min walk to the main tourist attractions and shopping streets the breakfast is better than average the street is a bit busy in the evening becase there are several night clubs nearby
