the staff were extremely helpful and marco looked after us very well at breakfast the breakfast was the best hotel breakfast i have ever had the hotel oozes style and the whole experience was excellent it was in close proximity to the statin and the metro it was a minute walk to the duomo however it was a very good area to walk through the area felt very safe and it was very clean top marks from us we will hopefully visit again
