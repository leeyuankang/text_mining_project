the room was large we were told we had been given an upgrade and the bed too it was very comfy the shower was efficient and the hairdrier was as good as hotel ones in the bathroom ever are the breakfast room was lovely spacious and airy and the staff were attentive and very pleasant the selection at breakfast was amazing and always being replenished so even late comers had the same choice as the early birds the hotel was very near the centre and we could walk to the duomo in a few minutes reception were good at getting a taxi for us when required
