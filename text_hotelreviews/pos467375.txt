i was extremely impressed with the square milano duomo i was apprehensive about it but it was so close to the sites i wanted to see and the missori metro was just around the corner the hotel is modern and attractive upon entering i was upgraded to an executive room from a deluxe double it was a fourth floor room and quiet beautiful very large room and large bathroom the bed and pillows were very comfortable and cushy surprise to have a nespresso machine the flooring was a wood laminate which is cleaner than carpeting the breakfast buffet was delightfully yummy with so many choices for everyone s desires plus a nice glassed partial surround view to enjoy it the wifi was good the reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful with any questions the electric trains and trolleys do pass by the hotel frequently but that s the ambiance of being in milan the popular duomo is a close minute walk and the santa maria del grasie is a minute walk using a good map i had a wonderful two night stay and would be pleased to stay here again
