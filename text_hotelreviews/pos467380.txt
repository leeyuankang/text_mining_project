staff was very helpful from the start gave us an upgraded room very spacious inside everything was very clean and beautifully arranged the room looked out at the garden but there was no view since the window was on the ground but it was not a problem we loved it bathroom was just like on the pictures gorgeous pillows make all the difference for me in the hotel and here they were just perfect not too soft but i was sinking in them had a great sleep especially because we were traveling further the next day this was just what i needed i would recommend this hotel to everyone great location walking distance to major attractions stores and feels very safe around their rooftop bar and a restaurant is a must to visit too regardless where you stay it has great views and service
