gorgeous hotel rooms were comfy and luxurious the turn down service at night was wonderful as they left chocolates with the note buona notte next to your bed every evening the rooftop terrace bar was excellent the perfect addition to our stay we sat with a glass of pinot grigio watching the sunset after a day of sightseeing around beautiful milan there were free nibbles provided and when the wind picked up i was given a cosy blanket to help avoid being chilly it s the little things that count and this hotel has certainly paid attention to those
