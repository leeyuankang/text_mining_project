we had a beautiful and spacious room on the top floor with a terrace facing the sun and overlooking the city rooms were kept meticulously clean location of the hotel was just a few minutes walk from the duomo and easily reached by metro the hotel is modern and new staff went truly above and beyond my sister and i were sick and they offered to prepare some steamed rice and on request made soup even though it was not on the roomservice menu also when i found one of the chips already opened in the minibar they ended up charging us nothing for our use more than kind breakfast was good and the hostess welcomed us every morning with a big smile i would definitely return or recommend it
