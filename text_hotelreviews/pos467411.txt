i can t imagine that there is a better mid priced hotel in milan the building doesn t look like much on the outside but inside it is just about perfect the quiet rooms are simply but beautifully designed with excellent lighting windows that open and divinely comfortable bed and bedding our room had a spotless marble bathroom with robes and slippers towel warmer and large towels as well as excellent amenities replenished everyday there were complimentary mineral water and an espresso machine on the desk as well as chocolates on the nightstand stand the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful excellent english at reception and the breakfast included with our room was vast good european and anglo choices all this just steps from the duomo and galleria with a metro stop around the corner and trams and buses a few steps away tip the atypical bar two doors away recommended to us by reception staff is a find it offers the wonderful milan custom of apertivo a drink and all you can eat from buffet of antipasti stew roast meat rice and a sweet for ten euros inclusive if you arrive tired and are not up for dinner late as the italians eat it fancy restaurants don t open until bar atypical is a great solution
