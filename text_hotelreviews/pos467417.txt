the hotel was excellent the staff were very accommodating i was meeting a friend and we both arrived late in the evening i had reserved a room with two beds but got a small room with one bed they changed the room with no questions asked which even resulted in a bit of an upgrade and when my friend arrived with her suitcase locked closed even though it was nearly midnight they immediately found a maintenance person to open it for her the hotel bar is small but with a nice selection of drinks and snacks the location couldn t be better within minutes to the duomo and a nice stroll to the other sights in the city the breakfast was fantastic and extensive especially compared to the usual italian breakfast although it was on the pricier end of our budget the comfort of the room helpfulness of the staff the quality of the breakfast and the location made it worth it for a weekend trip to milan
