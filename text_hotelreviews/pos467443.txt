all the museums castello sforzesco the famous shopping district of course not to mention duomo cathedral are located within walking distance somewhere to minutes the metro station subway is right next to the square with one way fare euro so i used it several times quite convenient local people were very kind and friendly unlike those you would run into in france most of them spoke english fluently the hotel room was very clean and the staff were always eager to help and friendly wonderful breakfast that was included in the package was in my opinion a real value one restaurant named alla collina pistoise only minutes from the square was a real authentic milanese restaurant one must visit overall my experience with the hotel way above average despite the fact that i lost my passport inside the hotel
