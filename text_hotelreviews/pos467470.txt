the extra large room was fantastic allowing us space for bags and getting around them when open mightn t sound like much but after four weeks on the road we appreciated the spacious layout well designed rooms good size bathroom with huge shower double glazed windows kept the noise of trams to a minimum great location a few minutes walk to duomo and shopping front desk staff very helpful breakfast buffet had good selection of fresh produce also tea and coffee making facilities in room found a few great restaurants within a few blocks the hotel offers value for money and i would recommend
