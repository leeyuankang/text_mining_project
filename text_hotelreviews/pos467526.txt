lovely large modern rooms for a city break we always try to find a hotel that has coffee tea facilities in the room along with slippers nothing like those little extra comforts to add to the experience after a days sightseeing the staff were very friendly and helpful and one waitress at breakfast was just lovely sorry i can t remember her name she treated us as if we were family good quality bedding and towels changed everyday is another luxury touch the roof top bar was just perfect for that aperativo not far to go great service and lovely canap s but best of all the roof top view
