i loved everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location to see all the sights quite close to the duomo the staff gave excellent service helping with directions and suggestions for food options the room was very spacious which is not often found in italy we had free wifi and a delicious free breakfast i would definitely recommend this this hotel
