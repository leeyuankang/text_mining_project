this is a first rate business class hotel room was large and comfortable with great beds and pillows bathroom was roomy and well equipped we stayed here for the location which is a short walk from the cathedral and other city center sites and it is a little more costly than our usual stay but the location made it worth the cost breakfast was very good with a large selection of eggs bread rolls fruit yogurt juice american coffee etc we would definitely stay here again
