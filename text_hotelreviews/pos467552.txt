location was perfect its not scary at all to walk back to the hotel even late at night the huge bathroom could do with a little bit more counterspace breakfast was good it had hot cold salty and sweet dishes no omelet or fried egg though i am picky with cleanliness of hotels but with the square i did not need to wipe things with alcohol
