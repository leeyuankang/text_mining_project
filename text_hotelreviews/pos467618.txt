the staff were helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to help make our experience fantastic there was a wide range of breakfast options and everything we ate was delicious it is a perfect location as the duomo is only a short walk away and it is central to most of the tourist attractions the hotel was well maintained and clean i would recommend the hotel to friends and family or anyone else planning on staying in milan
