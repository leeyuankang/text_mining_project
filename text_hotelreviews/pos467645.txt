we really enjoyed this hotel as it was in a very convenient position to enjoy this city our room on the floor was very large with windows that could be opened and was extremely well set out the bathroom was fabulous with a great shower and huge fluffy towels which were replaced daily as were the toiletries the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful at all times
