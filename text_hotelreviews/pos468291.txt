the location near the lively and exciting navigli area was excellent and the hotel was still in a very quiet place the rooms were very convenient and nicely decorated the art works in all public areas contributed greatly to the cosiness and atmosphere breakfast was simple but excellent and the welcome happy hour buffet was also great
