the hotel is in a side alley off of the canal easy to reach from the metro porta genova it doesn t look up to much from the outside but much better inside the staff were very friendly and helpful beds very comfortable we had a room with a sofa too plus a small balcony which overlooked a quiet square filled with trees and singing birds in the evenings the free drink voucher was great as was the aperitivo buffet free too although the lobby area where it is served lacks ambience disappointed with the roof terrace not shown in photos and not worth a visit what appears to be the roof terrace in the photos with parasols etc is out the back of the hotel lobby very clean bathroom very good with some nice toiletries robe and slippers provided lively area with lots of bars and restaurants very busy on a saturday night recommend the mag caf for cocktails and el brellin for dinner and any other bar to sit with a glass of aperol would recommend this hotel and the whole area
