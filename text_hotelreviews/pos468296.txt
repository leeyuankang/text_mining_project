awesome location along the navagli canal wander along the pedestrian walkway by the canal to visit a multitude of bars and restaurants fantastic spot to savour milan nightlife a pleasant walk into the duomo takes about minutes depending on your speed and the heat lots of interesting small boutiques to browse in as you walk along more interesting than the standard chain stores in the centre beautiful breakfast room and selection of food would stay again
