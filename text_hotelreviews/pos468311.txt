we had a lovely stay at this hotel great location with lots of canalside bars and restaurants to choose from just around the corner the fabulous city centre was just a pleasant walk away excellent service from all the staff great breakfast buffet and the happy hour treats were an added bonus very happy to recommend it and hope to back again soon
