the hotel is in a fantastic location all of the bars and restaurants of the navigli are close by but it is still very peaceful at night the rooms are clean and nicely decorated the staff are polite and helpful and the breakfast was amazing the breakfast staff especially did a great job of serving everyone and keeping the wide selection of food replenished overall the hotel exceeded my expectations and i would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting milan
