the staff were amazing i have to say that as nothing was too much for them everything was done with a smile the staff really made a difference to our stay the hotel was very comfortable and clean loved the spa although the hotel was a little expensive it was worth it as the staff were so nice and great at their jobs the staff were the best asset of the hotel
