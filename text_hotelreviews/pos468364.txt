good buffet breakfast where you can press your own vegetable juice and request a cappuccino very handy to the pedestrian area around the canal great for restaurants at night nice to have a welcome cocktail and to have parking on site since the area has limited traffic access hotel has bikes available for free or there is a small fee for public bikes available all across town
