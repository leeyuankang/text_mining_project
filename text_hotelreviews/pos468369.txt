we had a problem on arrival and the receptionist sorted it out very quickly and efficiently afternoon and evening food i e small buffet is available free of charge and tea or coffee which is a very nice thing for the hotel to do and was very much appreciated staff at the hotel were all very polite friendly and efficient we would definitely return to the hotel again
