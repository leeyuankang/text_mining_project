great breakfast very clean rooms excellent staff it s a bit difficult to find due to being in a pedestrian zone but once you know it s very easy the hotel is a bit dated compared to newer design hotels however it delivers more in terms of charm beds are very good compared to those same newer design hotels like nhow staff is very friendly they even have a bell boy man that brings your luggage to the room which is a nice touch the staff is also very professional calling up to the room if they can clean the room in the afternoon if you put up the do not disturb sign most hotels would just skip room cleaning until the next day location is excellent right in the middle of the navigli area it s right around the corner so at night you ll be right in the middle of great bars and restaurants a
