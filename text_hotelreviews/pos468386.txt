the service was excellent the staff at the front desk were helpful and knowledgeable the location was fantastic close to the green line which took us to all the places we wanted to go it was wonderful to walk outside after a long day of sightseeing and have our choice of restaurants long the canal the supermarket across the street came in handy and there was always food available free for an apertif in the evenings usually you don t get this unless you have club room access will definitely stay here again clean large rooms
