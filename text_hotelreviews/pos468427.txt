big room and very comfortable bed large bathroom but bit dated great breakfast selection and very friendly staff the location is fantastic make sure you visit the food markets nearby easy to get to the centre would definitely stay here next time there are loads of great bars and restaurants on the doorstep and the whole region is buzzing at night if you get the bus from the airport it s only to the central rail station buy your tickets at the bus not inside the airport quite expensive for a taxi from the central station though so get the underground it s really cheap
