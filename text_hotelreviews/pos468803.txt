the second time rooms were great good size clean and comfortable if you have a choice get rooms at higher levels location is great close walking distance to many site seeing places two main metro systems are close by plus many trams and buses cross in front of hotel restaurants and cafes are close everywhere staff were mostly friendly and helpful one receptionist was not as good as others although garage was a public underground but was safe it s best not to drive in milan navigation is hard and confusing breakfast was decent and plenty they even let you pack a good portion to take with you if not hungry at that time the room service was great very helpful
