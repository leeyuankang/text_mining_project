the hotel location was on spot so close to the duomo vittorio emmanuelle galleria most importantly it was in a quiet neighborhood beside the duomo unlike other hotels there is also the duomo metro station beside the hotel if you don t want to move around the city by taxi the receptionists were very friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet had everything the wifi was strong in our room would definitely stay again at this hotel when visiting milan
