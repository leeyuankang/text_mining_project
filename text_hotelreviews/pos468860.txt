what a great location just a short stroll to the duomo la scala and street market whatever you do book a room with the breakfast included it is just amazing there is something for everyone if you can t find something you like it might be time to stop travelling our room on level was a reasonable size quiet beautifully appointed with lots of little touches of luxury the staff were very helpful and spoke english beds were good but firm
