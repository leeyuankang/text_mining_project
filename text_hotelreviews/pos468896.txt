the breakfast had lots of choice and the atmosphere was great the rooms were quiet and the bathroom was amazing the location of the property is perfect min walk to the main square hotel staff booked us a cab back to central station and it came within mins the room was cleaned daily and extra touches were given tea coffee was free in the room this was very handy
