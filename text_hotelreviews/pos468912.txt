location is excellent room is clean space is good they kept switches near the bed to switch off the lights close the outside curtain choosing do not disturb calling for housekeeping while lying down which is an excellent feature there are many restaurants including halal restaurant nearby i did not have the chance to try the hotel restaurant or breakfast surely will choose the same hotel if i come to milan again
