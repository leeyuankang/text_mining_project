every thing was perfect i arrived very early the welcome was very nice they give me a room without any problems i was traveling alone and i can say i feel very safe in hotel and surrounding the metro station missori is just few steps away from hotel directly from milano centrale to missori with metro for only from hotel to famous duomo is really short way to walk cca hotel is also good located for people who are interested in shopping i will definitely go in this hotel again
