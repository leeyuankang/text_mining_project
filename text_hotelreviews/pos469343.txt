the location between castello sforzesca and duomo is perfect if you re visiting milan for the sights the staff was very nice and helpful the basic double room wasn t that big but had everything we needed and was very quiet the breakfast selection was rather limited but included everything we needed and was of good quality the bacon that came with the scrambled eggs was perfect and the staff was really helpful there as well camperio house is a somewhat small place so the atmosphere in the hotel was pleasantly intimate and quiet
