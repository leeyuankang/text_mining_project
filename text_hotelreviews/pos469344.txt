great little cosy hotel perfect for a few nights away we got there late but the receptionist welcomed us and took us through the hotel and our room explaining all the ins outs breakfast was good and we liked that they cooked the eggs and bacon on request they also will make you a cafe coffee if you want so feel free to ask the room was larger than expected and had a lovely bathroom with a huge drop shower the location was fantastic a quick walk to pretty much everything
