elegant property in a really convenient location but on a quiet street entry is through a nondescript entrance with a small name plate on the wall that is easily missed but leads on to a shared stylish courtyard space our family room was a really good size with stair up to an additional single bed on a loft landing space in room kitchen facilities handy though we didn t use much very nice toiletries the buffet breakfast is really superior quality with very fresh ingredients focaccia bread divine and the freshly made coffee from the barista machine is excellent we would definitely stay at camperio house again
