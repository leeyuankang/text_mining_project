very spacious rooms and all the fixtures fittings and furnishings are to a very high standard having a fridge was a big bonus very close to the shops but not on the main street so away from all the noise and hubbub we stayed on saturday and sunday night which were very peaceful but on monday morning there was quite a bit of noise from building work closely next door
