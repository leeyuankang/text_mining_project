the hotel regina is beautifully kept and decorated in a more traditional italian style our room reeked of cigarette smoke however the staff immediately changed our room to the floor the second room was excellent and looked over a quaint courtyard the location is perfect near the duomo and excellent restaurants the breakfasts were ample and delicious with beautiful service in the downstairs dining room we would definitely return when staying in milan
