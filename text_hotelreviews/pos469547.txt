this is my second time staying at the hotel regina and i would stay the next time i go too love the location because it is central to everything about mins walk away from duomo from brera and from navigli the street that it is located on has lots of shops and some good ones too so you don t have to always go to the duomo area to find something the breakfast buffet in the morning is fantastic the food is delicious and there are also gluten free options overall my experience at hotel regina made my stay in milan wonderful the service is excellent the rooms and nice and clean and the location is superb
