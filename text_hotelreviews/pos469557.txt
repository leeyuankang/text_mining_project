the staff were more than helpful and nice the hotel itself is charming lobby is beautifully decorated and inviting the courtyard is cozy ask for a room facing the courtyard quiet and a great view mine was room on the small side but very comfortable the complimentary breakfast was very nice lots of fruit cereal yogurts breads and cakes clean great location highly recommend for a traveler who wants local charm insists upon cleanliness not fussy or wishing to be pampered
