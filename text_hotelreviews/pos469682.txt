remodeled and updated room hotel in a good location to walk to various sites on a quiet street off of the main streets might be hard to find on own one way streets to navigate wonderful staff and lovely accommodations very good wifi in the rooms we booked the suite on upper floor which was a higher price point than the other rooms there was a small lift to get to top floor we enjoyed the private patio had easy walks to several restaurants close by full continental breakfast with a wide variety of options we enjoyed our four days at this hotel
