great location all key sights within easy reach by foot la scala is literally round the corner nord cadorna train station where the malpensa airport express arrives is within minutes walk despite a very central location it is very quiet at night the room as well as the bathroom are spacious and i loved the firm but not too firm mattress such a contrast to the soft mattresses all too often found in hotel beds drinking water in the room was free of charge and was replaced daily staff are friendly and helpful
