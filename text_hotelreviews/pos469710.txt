i liked the boutique nature of the hotel only a few rooms the great service and the excellent breakfasts a petite breakfast room but a really delightful selection including breads hams cheeses fruit and pastries the combination of modern sleek rooms with things like good bathrooms and bedding and flatscreen tvs in an older renovated building was very pleasing the location is very good although it is in a very quiet street it is only a few minutes walk to the main city centre
