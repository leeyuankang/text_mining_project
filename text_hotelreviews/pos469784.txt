the location is excellent a short stroll from the duomo and from the restaurants in brera the trains to and from malpensa depart from cadorna station which is just five minutes away on foot and there is a metro station right outside the hotel the room was clean and spacious if rather lacking in ambiance and came with complimentary soft drinks the breakfast buffet had plenty of choice
