i had a very quiet room with unlimited access to wifi and inclusive minibar which was replenished every day this was so convenient because i did not have to stop by a grocery store to pick up water and other refreshments the breakfast was so convenient and had a variety of options but they used instant coffee for my americano the staff was very professional and friendly the location is very convenient the hotel is about minutes of walking from duomo and about minutes from the last supper there is also an metro station literally in front of the hotel
