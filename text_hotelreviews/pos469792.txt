at first they couldn t locate my reservation made through booking com and offered me an executive room at their sister hotel once i insisted that my reservation was valid and i was tired to go to another hotel they somehow found a room for me after the more experienced receptionist explained that they just merged their booking system with another one and that is why they couldn t find my booking in any case the hotel is great the room is spacious and the location is perfect
