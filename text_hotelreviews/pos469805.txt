very nice location on the outside of the inner city ring across the street from castello sforzesco and few minutes from duomo modern and comfortable room had one without a view friendly and helpful staff decent breakfast typical for a hotel somewhat lacking in variety of food but with a free espresso based coffee brewed to order wi fi worked fine in the room well connected with the subway
