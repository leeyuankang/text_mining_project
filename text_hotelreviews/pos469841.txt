great surprise i usually stay at another modern hotel near the duomo but will be switching here staff was welcoming the hotel s facilities are from another era phones lamps etc but everything is pristine and mattress was amazing and room sizes are big so all in all it added charm and comfort parking is directly below the hotel which is really cool
