the location was perfect most of the staff was extremely helpful except for one lady who was extremely nastyon check in there was a big fair going on and they were obviously busy they even found a place for me to get my nails done however they also ruined a pair of my pants and said they were already ruined no way i could have had bleach on my pants so not happy with that room was in the back and quiet and able to open windows however the room was dark next time i may opt for a room in the front on a high floor but imagine the noise is pretty bad considering it faces a busy street
