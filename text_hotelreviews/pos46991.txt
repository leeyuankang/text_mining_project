really couldn t have been a better stay the staff were so helpful the hotel being brand spanking new is spotlessly clean the pool was a huge treat and slept like a baby in the very comfortable beds the location was perfect and allowed us to walk everywhere all weekend taking only minutes to be on the champs elysee or to the eiffel tower or louvre
