excellent location walking distance to duomo and to the very lively navigli neighbourhood the rooms are comfortable and updated breakfast is excellent and the staff was courteous if perhaps a little stiff the hotel itself is not very large and has no spa or fitness facilities which i would have expected of a but it had everything that you require and the accommodations are more than adequate i would recommend and i would definitely return
