it s an old hotel but our room was clean beds were comfortable and the bathroom was modern with an incredible shower breakfast was included with our stay and it was probably the best breakfast we had during our whole trip offerings included cereal fresh pastries eggs bacon and fruit the hotel is located in a less touristy area with plenty of great places to eat english speakers will need to know some italian to get by and we were still within a min walking distance to the duomo easily accessible by public transportation just a short walk to the metro
