the location was perfect the staff could not be more helpful and accommodating we arrived during a power outage and were made to feel absolutely special with a cup of coffee and a lovely area to sit and wait out the problem our room was ready before we arrived and we also left luggage in their storage during our two week travels of italy that was in our room when we arrived the parking is typically costly as it is all over italy when in city centers but it worked exceptionally well overall a great stay at a lovely comfortable hotel
