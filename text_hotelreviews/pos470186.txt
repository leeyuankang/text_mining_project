we stay here about six times a year because we are return guests we are usually upgraded from a superior double to a junior suite depending on the season the location is superb the staff is always welcoming and helpful and the roof terrace is lovely with its splendid views of the city try going there for just a trendy cocktail if you cannot stay there
