hotel was in an excellent location staff very helpful and friendly it was my partners birthday and we wanted to book a nice meal so i discussed with one of the guys on reception who checked us in and very friendly sorry can t remember his name he help us pick a place and the next day when we arrived back at the hotel after a day of shopping and sightseeing in the room was some fruit and a bottle of prosecco with a lovely note wishing him happy birthday would definitely stay at this hotel again the view from the sky bar was fabulous and even though the bar staff had a private function they still allowed to have a quite drink in the corner we are very well traveled and stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this was not a disappointment and would recommend it to anyone
