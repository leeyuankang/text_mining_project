we were given an interior southern faced room with terrace on the last floor which might be the reason why we felt being in a quite and bright room we didn t need to ask or complain for anything but all the staff we had to exchange with including front desk and breakfast room where welcoming polite and smiling and perhaps both parties speaking fluent italian english or french made things easier for all seriously considering to repeat here in our next stay in milan try the prosecco at the shop next door and the chocolates and ice cream in the one just crossing the street
