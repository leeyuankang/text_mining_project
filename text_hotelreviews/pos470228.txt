great location we picked this hotel because we had la scala opera tickets this was a perfect location for that the duomo being on the edge of la brera was also a bonus for restaurants hotel also had a small private garage across the street for the usual additional charges the breakfast was very good the hotel concierge during the day was very helpful with suggestions
