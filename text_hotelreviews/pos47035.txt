the staff were exceptional from start to finish nothing was too much trouble offered bottled water on arrival room allocated early the breakfast was lovely plentiful location was perfect for day time shopping only a short distance from oxford street and marble arch it took us half an hour on the bus to get back from covent garden where we saw a show overall a great stay
