the staff were exceptional the warm welcome every staff member gave from concierge to staff serving you drinks inquiring what kind of day you had to how could they help with direction etc breakfast the choice was tremendous we had the use of the executive lounge we only used this once but we believe worth paying that little extra for enjoyable stay and will certainly recommend
