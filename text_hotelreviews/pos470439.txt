i think the price quality ratio was good it was good value for money of course ih is a chain which sets a standard for the services and facilities therefore i would choose this for business trips or trips with larger groups as the facilities are suited that the room was clean had a large window and fine mattresses on the beds also the bathroom was quite large and the shower worked fine the breakfast is industrial but fine there are standard bread slices baked off croissants alhtough only a few plain ones the rest was with chocolat and jam or cheeses scrambled egg saucages salads and some sweet cakes
