the hotel is nice and in a quiet location from the other reviews i was afraid of the location to be put away but bus stop is near takes you to the central train station and to the arco de pace almost center from metro station sondrio you can continue to duomo it takes only minutes to walk there or you can take any of the buses to the metro station it is therefore an excellent location to start to explore the city by public transport breakfast starts at what is a wonderful benefit as we needed to check out early in the morning breakfast is excellent and tasty abundant selection of hams yogurts some vegetables and plenty of fruits the room is nice and comfortable beds are comfortable
