we arrived with a car no problem finding the place with gps and stayed in the hotel for two nights even though hotel has private parking euros per day we used free public parking space as it is in front of the hotel and area is quite safe staff was helpful with directing us to the center and public transportation but we searched this before coming to the hotel as well there are usefull metro bus and city apps that all work offline so it is not bad to check them before going to the city room was nice and tidy with good shower and ok bed breakfast was excellent especcialy as we are talking about italian breakfast that are not very various and rich with offer from my past experiances all kinds of different salami cheese delicious cakes fruit all in all this is ok place for milano stay if you don t have troubles with walking metros and buses and if you don t need for hotel to be the it factor of your stay
