beautiful room they upgraded us to a suite on the top floor which was very lovely we had stayed here two weeks earlier on arrival to italy through milan and our room had been less expensive i guess because it was a friday and this is primarily a business traveler hotel it was a nice surprise to get more space since we were paying more the breakfast buffet is excellent juice fresh fruit cereal yogurt fresh pastries eggs etc and they bring you whatever hot beverage you request hotel is very close to the train station literally two blocks away which is why we stayed here the hotel arranged for us to have a car service to the airport but there is also transportation at the train station to the airport if we were to fly in and out of italy via milan again we would definitely use this hotel on arrival and before departure
