we came by train to milan and it was a very short walk from the train station to the hotel a definite plus the rooms are slightly bigger than the european standard and with all the amenities that travelers expect the decor and ambience here was a stunner very old school and very well done the staff was for the most part very helpful we got some incorrect info one night but it was corrected the next day marble decorations massive doors and a bathroom shower that for europe was a pleasant surprise the restaurant on the floor is must and is very good as well the neighborhood at night does not not need another statistic we tried walking out for dinner the first night and quickly changed our minds stay at home at night with good food excellent service and very good prices transportation to the town center is easy and cheap with the train station a minute walk and the tram station less than a minute away
