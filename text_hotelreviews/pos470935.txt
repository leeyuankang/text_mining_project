the hotel room was very smart the wooden furniture and door was decorated with an inlay we liked the crisp bedding comfortable bed multiple lights and nice bathroom with a good shower i also enjoyed the delicious chocolate croissants at breakfast the hotel was very convenient for the metro otherwise it took us about half an hour to walk to the duomo
