andreola is definitely the best place to stay around centrale it s retro and traditional good breakfasts and very clean rooms the staff is a bit cold but it s been like that since when i stayed there for the first time so you can get used to it the view on good old via scarlatti is charming it was my third stay and i still strongly recommend it
