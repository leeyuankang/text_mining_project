from the moment we arrived we were made to feel valued and cared for from the valet car service to the fact that we were upgraded to the most beautiful penthouse suite because it was my birthday the bed was sublime the breakfast was excellent and every single member of staff that we came into contact with was attentive and friendly nothing was too much trouble we left feeling rested revitalised and refreshed in a nutshell i would say that the comfort of this hotel is incredible but what really makes it exemplary is its exquisite care and attention to the client auguri to the management and all the staff we hope to return very soon
