great location if you are aiming to travel to and from central station for instance upon returning from our trip to venice the hotel was just opposite the station which was incredibly handy situated in a quiet location which meant no noise disturbance clean breakfast staff were incredibly helpful and polite an argument to be made for employing more staff aged and upwards good places to dine around the hotel
