breakfast is italian guests are mainly italians so that seems to be fine for everyone there i personally would have liked something else than a desk full of cakes and sweets but thats just my personal opinion the tea was very good though the hotel has a very old fashion style some would say elegant and others find it dusty but was really clean staff was very very friendly and helpful two supermarkets right next door good connection to tram and underground not far from city center just a nice walk away my stay was fine would go again the photo shwos a single room small but neat with a balcony at the back of the hotel
