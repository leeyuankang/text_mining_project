very comfortable large room for a good price the location was one where you could get the metro to anywhere you wanted to go in just a few stops the metro is clean and easy also close to the central train stations which was convenient for our arrival and our day trip to como appreciated the offer of extra amenities including a more comfortable pillow the gentleman at reception when we arrived continued to be our man in milan with clear directions and many good suggestions all staff was helpful but dominico was exceptional
