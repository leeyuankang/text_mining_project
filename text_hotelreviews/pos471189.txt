the hotel is about a minute walk to the train station and metro very convenient the hotel is modern and clean the staff is helpful our junior suite was very comfortable beds were great beautiful bathroom with large shower lots of choices for breakfast the bar restaurant has outdoor tables that make having an evening drink fun and manageable for people with kids in tow wifi a bit irritating to get onto but fine once we had signed in
