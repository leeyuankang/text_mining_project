the staff really outdid themselves and were so friendly and caring a really wonderful hotel top marks our child became sick with the flu and they brought us ginger tea with honey always asking how she was doing a special thank you to the staff at the bar restaurant working in the half term walking distance to oxford st marble arch and ethnic restaurants on edgeware rd if you want to be frugal then i recommend the sandwiches from pret instead much cheaper also m s has great food to take away we recommend dinning at the hotel which is much cheaper than what you ll end up paying incl the service charge of elsewhere will return missing the hotel already
