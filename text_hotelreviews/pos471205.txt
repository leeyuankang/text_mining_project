this hotel was only one block from the milan central train station the location while very convenient for the train was not an area that i would feel comfortable walking around at night the hotel was gorgeous and had an amazing breakfast the staff went above and beyond and the security at the hotel was excellent i would highly recommend this hotel for its excellent breakfast high quality of amenities and location to the train station
