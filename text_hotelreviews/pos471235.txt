we were only here for evening and we booked it for the proximity to the train station as we flew into milan and was leaving by train to venice this was a big plus as the train station was from the hotel mobility the property is in a business area it is in front of a light rail line and the metro stop is about walk this got us easily to all the sights comfort the room was clean and nice the hotel had more a of a luxury apartment feel then hotel normal adminities bed very firm desk sitting area telly and minibar bathroom was clean and had a walk in rain shower front desk staff and bar friendly service was good
