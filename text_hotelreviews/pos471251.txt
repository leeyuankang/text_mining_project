a lovely hotel in a great location near to central station but in a quiet setting we found it very easily on arrival from milan malpensa airport by train and it was a great base from which to pick up our rental car get the bus to milan linate airport on departure and to catch the subway into central milan the suite was lovely clean spacious and nicely furbished breakfast was good with plenty of selection we wouldn t hesitate in recommending it to other families we travelled with our sons aged and yrs we stayed at either end of our trip for a night each time and it was ideal the staff were very welcoming and even arranged for the bar to stay open to serve us some food when we arrived late from the airport after it had just closed
