the hotel is close to milano centrale station which is great but is quite a long way from the centre of milan however the metro system in milan is very good the hotel felt more like a typical business focussed hotel it is very modern but lacks any atmosphere the rooms are pretty spacious and clean breakfast in the hotel was good
