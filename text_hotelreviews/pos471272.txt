the experience of staying at una was just fantastic the stuff were extremely helpful the room was stylish clean and comfortable the breakast was sufficient and varied we also got the room on a higher floor with a nice view overlooking the city and a double bed all the things we specified as desirable prerequisites in our booking the hotel is also close to a train metro station which is very convinient the only thing is that it might be diffucult to fnd the entrance once you arrive late so it s better to familiarize yourself with direction prior to the arrival
