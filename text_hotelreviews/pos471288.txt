chose to stay in this hotel as it was only a short walk from the central station this made it very easy to get around milan on the metro and hop on hop off bus and to from bergamo airport room was spacious bed very comfy breakfast was quite extensive cooked items fruit yogurts pastries cheeses hams salad reception staff were helpful the entrance is set back from the road so you really need to look out for the roadside signs for the hotel entrance some very good restaurants in the area around the hotel
