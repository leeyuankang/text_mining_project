we select this hotel because based on price and location everything was as promised very clean rooms as in the pictures good breakfast perfect location wifi fine recommended just one little thing it s not easy to get there we arrive to milano centrale it s very close but there s no appropiate signs of the hotel so it s a little though to find the address
