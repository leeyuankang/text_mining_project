nice business hotel next to the main station in milan we were here twice first time for one night and sortly after that for three nights more at first we had great impression of the hotel spacious rooms big bathroom great lighting superb view over milan nice breakfast the breakfast restaurant is a bit small for the capacity of the hotel but the management did its best to deal with queues every morning however the staff at the reception was extremely helpful especially roberta overall value for money was very good
