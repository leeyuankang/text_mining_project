the breakfast was amazing with eggs ham yogurt pastries and fruit there was anything you would want to eat the nearby restaurants and hotel were well managed the hotel representatives were helpful when recommending places to go they all has a good sense of humor i would recommend this hotel for the location to public transportation it is located off on a side road which is less traveled for a quiet place to stay
