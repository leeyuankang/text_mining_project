the location is really great next to a subway and eight minutes from the central station by foot easy to find twenty something from the duomo also by foot by subway and away from the crowd the room had a really nice size the bathroom as a whole was huge it was very clean great wifi the hotel is beautiful the flooring blew my mind it has a market in front of it and a pharmacy nearby if you don t get a room facing the street it s really quiet check out at is really great compared to the of a lot of other places in italy
