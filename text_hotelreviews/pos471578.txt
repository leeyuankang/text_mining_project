we used metered parking on the street outside while checking in then paid to have the car taken to a private garage which was a bit expensive but worth it for peace of mind as we had to leave a lot of luggage in it there is a metro station nearby and various restaurants and a well stocked mini market shop opposite comfortable clean room and we slept well good buffet breakfast although the tea and coffee service was a little slow
