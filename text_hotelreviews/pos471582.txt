we stayed in room and it was quite big and comfortable the room was very clean and the bathroom decently big the red marble floor in the bathroom was gorgeous i was a bit worried after reading some of the earlier reviews but honestly i couldn t find anything that bad about the property also the property is very close to centrale and republica stations walk to duomo will take about min it s a pleasant walk though
