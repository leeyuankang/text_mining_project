accomodating hotel very clean and with nice furniture the room was lovely and gave off a luxurious air with marble in bathroom and the gold colour of the furniture breakfast was also quite rich and rich a variety of sweet and salty choices as well as espresso and cappuccino quite close to milan central station and to metro stations that proved quite handy for excursions outside milan all in all a great place to stay in milan highly recommended
