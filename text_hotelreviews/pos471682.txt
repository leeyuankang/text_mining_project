the hotel is recently renovated and it is very clean the mattress was very very good definitely a good reason for booking the hotel the air conditioning really worked great on the heat wave the wi fi is specific to the room and the tv is also smart so that you can output youtube from your android device very nice toiletries very good location close to reppublica metro very nice supermarket across the street and you can get your own stuff and store in the mini fridge
