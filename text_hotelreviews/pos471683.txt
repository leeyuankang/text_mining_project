i chose this hotel primarily for the affordable price and it s proximity to milano centrale it is only a minute walk from the station to the hotel it s less than a minute walk to the replubbica metro station the hotel room was clean and spacious i also appreciate being able to check in earlier than normal times as my room was ready it s a nice option if visiting milan for a short period of time
