hotel cavour is an excellent hotel the staff are very friendly helpful and professional they make you feel welcome and treat you as a welcome quest the hotel is very central and close to the city centre and the breda district the room was very clean well serviced and having a chocolate put on your bed before bed time is a very nice and personal touch my room had a bath which was good for a nice soaking after a long day of walking i used the excellent spa facility and particularly enjoyed the steam room the spa was also very clean and the spa amenities bag includes a robe and jandals the buffet breakfast was very good too with a wide range of food the cappuccino was tasty and the range croissant very tempting i tried the chocolate and whole wheat ones there were even vegan ones the only suggestion i have is to provide more coffee and tea in the rooms and also some milk there is however a well stocked small supermarket very close to the hotel in the breda neighbourhood i can recommend this hotel wifi is free and the signal is strong
