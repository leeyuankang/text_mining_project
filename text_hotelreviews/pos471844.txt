the staff was very friendly we arrived late the next morning because of our flight but they kept the room for us and even invited us to have breakfast first the location was close to all the places we need to visit everything was within walking distance from the hotel what i love about this hotel was the neighborhood it was located in there was a park behind the hotel which gave a relaxing walk to get away from the crowds this was a perfect place to be in when staying in milan
