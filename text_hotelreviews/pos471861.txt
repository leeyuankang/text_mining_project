we loved the friendly atmosphere and the overall sense of comfort it was a joy to relax in the foyer with a coffee or glass of wine after a busy day the bar area which also served light meals was great and the complimentary snacks added to the pleasure the staff were amazing and i would particularly mention kumar who staffed the bar and was always so pleasant and efficient the hotel was convenient for walking to the centre of the city and there were many restaurants in the brera area close by
