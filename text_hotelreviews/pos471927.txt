i ve stayed at many different hotels in the milan area over the years and really liked this one the location was perfect we had tickets at the scala and it was a short walk to the opera duomo galleria from the hotel the hotel was clean comfortable sunny and had sound reinforced windows staff was efficient i didn t eat breakfast but it looked plentiful
