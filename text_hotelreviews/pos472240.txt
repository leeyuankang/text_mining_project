the cheapest breakfast i have had in hotels euros and a good one too several warm options lost of pastry several jogurts etc the location is right in the middle between central station and buenos aires street shopping minutes each way great for the weekend trip the area is not the most fancy one but it has lots of restaurants carrefour around the corner several coffee places the rooms are a bit smallish but it was okay staff is super friendly and helpful
