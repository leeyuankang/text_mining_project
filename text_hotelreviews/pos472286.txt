the staff was excellent very helpful and very friendly this was my last stop in italy the staff really made the difference but the room also exceeded expectations i had used the left luggage facility after booking out and when i returned had a bit of a time gap i was able to stay in the lounge area clean up in the spa area and enjoy the afternoon treats they put out for guests the staff still took care of me and made me feel welcome even after checkout
