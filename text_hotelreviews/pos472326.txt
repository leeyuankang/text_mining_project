the staff are very awesome they allowed us to check in hours earlier and asked us if we wanted to leave our luggage after checkout so enjoy our last day they even offered us the drinks we consumed from the mini bar they managed to make a queen size bed for us upon our arrival and recommended to us what to do in the the city and how to get to places the breakfast is very generous and there are lots of varieties i definitely recommend it they offer free bikes as well for their consumers thank you deborah
