the location is quite convenient the hotel is located very close to the metro station and it takes about minutes to get the the center free parking subject to availability though is another big plus at many hotels in milan you have to pay euros a day for parking breakfast was very tasty and fresh beds are very comfortable staff is professional efficient and friendly when we arrived there was some unpleasant smell coming from the ventilation system which we reported to the reception and left for a city walk the problem was totally fixed by the time we came back would recommend this hotel
