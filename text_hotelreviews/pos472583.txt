everything from the time i entered the hotel to the time i left the hotel the staff at the reception were very welcoming and polite they showed us the way to the rooms the place was so clean and modern it has a different twist felt like a star hotel the rooms were very clean and comfortable everyone was smiling and welling to help we had no adapters and they provided them breakfast was excellent even during checkout they were asking about our stay i would give this hotel out of and would recommend anyone visiting milan to stay here especially if they r staying for more than one night i also wish for them the best and hope they stay the same
