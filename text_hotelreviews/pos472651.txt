the place was just amazing the staff is not just friendly they are taking such a good care of you that you are completely spoiled breakfasts are at least exceeding expectations variety and quality of products is exceptional even as hotel when i heard that the restaurant s chef was awarded michelin star i got skeptical expecting big show around and not so much food in it but it turned to be great experience every dish was piece of art looking smelling and tasting the rooms are gorgeous the care of every detail cleanness and bathrooms with mirror walls are just few details which you will love about this place
