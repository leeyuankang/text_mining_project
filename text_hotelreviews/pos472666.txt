hidden on the old heart of milano an ancient factory of perfumes turned in a top star hotel i like to remember a place not for what i saw or touched but for the way i felt and in this place i really felt good the suites were spacious and i can say that the stars don t end at the half the hotel but you cans see it all around details and new way of seying hospitality we could choose from different pillow a michelin starred room service and a seat in the shower just to mention few and off course all sort of essence around the hotel
