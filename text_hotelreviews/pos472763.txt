located just across the square from the railway station this hotel was perfect for an overnight stay the reception staff were a little off hand but check in was smooth and efficient and our room was quite lovely most of all the bed was super comfy and exactly what we needed after a long day of travel next morning we enjoyed an excellent breakfast buffet with plenty to choose from
