great breakfast plenty of choice and lovely dining area comfortable bed and nice sitting area great location and a perfect choice for a short stay i like the fact that this hotel is not huge and that the room i had offered a nice view of stazione centrale and surrounds a very convenient location for restaurants and transport to the airports and the metro station for yellow and red lines connecting to all other lines it s an easy walk into the city centre and duomo area my room was very quiet despite being located in a busy area i really like the interior design of this hotel quirky and interesting and fun
