the room was very comfortable plush towels and bed linens buffet breakfast was included but we had to miss it because of our early flight we were pleased to get a room with a balcony it offered a good view of milano centrale it was a quiet area too but close to the metro for visiting the more touristy areas this area had plenty of restaurants close by to choose from for dining
