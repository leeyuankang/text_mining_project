this hotel is really reasonably priced with breakfast included it s close to what seems to be some sort of events place like the nec so perfect for a business trip linked to that but it s also really close to a new metro line so access to central milan takes about mins and is pretty simple to navigate i was at a conference in a hotel on corso sempione so we mostly ate in that area it s a minute walk away from the hotel and there are some lovely restaurants around there
