excellent information by reception speaking english proficiently on how to get to the city centre easy access to centre of milan by catching the hotel transport to san siro underground station and thereafter underground trains cost only one way hotel great value for money as city centre hotels extremely expensive secure car parking on site for a day although reviews suggest otherwise perhaps different when it s a milan football match breakfast was good although very busy beware of mosquitoes especially waiting at night time by san siro underground for the hotel transport maybe unusual for this time of year but bitten a lot
