value for money is exceptional and although the location is pretty horrendous every effort is made to help the guest and with a bit of patience it turned out to be the right place for us the rooms are star the restaurant isn t however the breakfast was free and was edible my son and i like our own space so to get two rooms for under was fantastic and we would stay there again especially now we understand the public transport system better the staff were very good and as helpful as they could be public areas were bright and offered a lot of space but were very warm
