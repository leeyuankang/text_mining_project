the hotel is located in a remote part of the city there is no mode to reach the location in odd hours there is no restaurants or means of transport located in vicinity the airport shuttle service provided by hotels is very expensive and is not dependable i would suggest anyone planning to stay in this hotel to avoid it at any cost
