early bird discounted bedroom was much smaller than expected no chair desk for sitting space but spacious cupboards traditional style woodwork and extremely comfortable beds i never slept so well in a hotel no noise from outside or inside the tram runs right outside the hotel so dispite it being north of the centre good for rest for strolling through a quieter part of town with the best gelato shop in the city just a quiet min stroll away panagetti hotel staff extremely polite buffet breakfast vast and complete but boring after days with no changes coffee excellent as was just stopping in for a quick macchiato at the front door
