i would look no further for my next time everything is top the room was a bit cold because they switched to spring settings but the staff is super friendly smiling ready to make things work the bed is comfy the wifi is one of the fastest i have seen in a hotel it is just cumbersome to login every time but honestly no complaint compared to the other hotels with terrible wifi
