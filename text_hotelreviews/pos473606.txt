the room location and price is very much fair i really enjoyed my stay there the staff was pretty professional though didn t seem very familiar warm and friendly how usually italians are though they did not refuse me to keep my luggage for days when i was off for the weekends the breakfast was super rich and delicious though the menu of the dinner was too much complicated kinda gourmet style and there was not lot of simple eatable food the dinner menu had only few dishes it took me a while to decide what to order out of dishes and still i didn t like the food i selected at the end all the rest was super great beautiful elegant rooms with high quality expensive furniture in classical style bathroom was also good equipped thank you for hosting me definitely will be back
