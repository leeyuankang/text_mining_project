small room good beds with possibility to ask for different pillows the complementary drinks in the mini bar are a nice extra the room was not completely silent but it was silent enough for sleeping curtains block out the light completely allowing for an undisturbed night the location is good public transport is very well organised and the hotel is within walking distance of both the centre and the stations both with their own atmosphere a good choice for a few days in milan
