we traveled from friday to sunday benefiting of a room upgrade to a junior suite the room was large enough but very basic and the free minibar which was also advertised for the double room meant some water and one coke the beds and sheets were comfortable breakfast was good walking to the dome takes minutes on streets full of stores there is a public parking in front of the hotel charging euro hour but free after pm there is also a garage behind the hotel with euro day close to central station as well minutes walking
