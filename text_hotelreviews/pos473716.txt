the interior of the hotel is really nice a combination of classic and modern elements same is valid for the rooms everybody of the staff is very welcoming the breakfast dinner drinks and snacks in the integrated restaurant bistro bar were also great the location is also perfect min walk from the central station min walk until the center depending on how you let yourself be distracted by the fashion district you are walking through in case you are not up for walking the metro station is just around the corner it doesn t take more than five minutes to reach duomo in a nutshell a perfect experience at least for our requirements
