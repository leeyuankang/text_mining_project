staff were very helpful and welcoming the beds were super comfortable and bathrooms modern and really clean we loved the breakfast buffet that was included in the price and i usually hate buffets but the food selection was excellent staff so polite and helpful four points is an easy minute walk to the beautiful milan centrale train station we used the metro to get into old milan and the national trains for a day trip to bergamo so easy
