although a bit out of the way vis a vis downtown it is a perfect transit place for the airport and train station mastering the metro system is easy the staff was particularly helpful with day trip advice and nearby restaurant suggestions this is not a boutique hotel but modeled on the american system it is a maze of rooms and common areas that make for an efficient comfortable stay breakfast is a huge choice of quality items
