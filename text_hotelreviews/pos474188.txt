the staff were very helpful and attentive we needed to move rooms due to our aircon not working and they set t up right away they also helped us with tips on what to do in milan and where to go great variety for breakfast but they need to get real eggs as powdered stuff is quite disgusting and definitely not what i d expect for a star hotel
