seems to be fine option for car traveling since there is tram line minutes walk away that runs directly to duomo and to lanza and it is possible to find parking for free just be aware that it takes quite a long time to reach the hotel from the venice highroad since the hotel seems to be new it is mostly comfortable and clean
