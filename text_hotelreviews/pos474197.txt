the breakfast had a huge variety we were a little concerned with the hotel in advance because we read the reviews but then were surprised when we arrived the rooms are not very large but clean and not tiny either the location was convenient a bus stop to the next metro station pretty much in front of the hotel we usually walked back from the duomo or canal to the hotel and it wasn t a big deal we d definitely stay there again
