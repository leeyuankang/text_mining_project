after spending nights doubled over in our previous accommodation see my review of hintown navigli lovers it was a great relief to enter our room here it was clean spacious well appointed and very quiet and comfortable the staff were very pleasant we did not try the restaurant but the rooftop bar is lovely centrale train station is nearby so the hotel is handy to the metro system and malpensa airport we found a great cafe and our favourite milano ristorante within easy walking distance would definitely stay here again
