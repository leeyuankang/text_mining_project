this was my second trip to lagare i love the hotel it s super stylish and located a very short walk to central station which makes it a great base to explore both the city via the metro and northern italy such as lake como via trains which take around minutes to get up to the lakes the hotel oozes style there is a fantastic lounge area where you can relax enjoy a coffee beer or wine and watch the day go by both rooms have been excellent super comfy beds and incredibly clean en suite bathrooms
