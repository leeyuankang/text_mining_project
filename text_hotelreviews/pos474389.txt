the room was great with a very comfortable bed the overall interior design of the hotel is splendid and there are ample facilities including a gym the colour lights on the exterior of the window also made gave the hotel an overall warm ambience the neighbourhood was also quiet and void of loud noises even in the weekend yet the location is convenient to get to by metro and is a stone throw s from the train station i would highly recommend this hotel and say that it is well worth the money
