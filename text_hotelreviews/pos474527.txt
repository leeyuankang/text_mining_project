great location within walking distance to stazione centrale spacious luxurious room huge bathroom and a separate sauna room which was a bonus which we didn t have time to use though this was also the con the ceiling had molds good thing we didn t care to use the sauna and it was not connected to the bathroom all in all i d say lagare is affordable luxury we had a very relaxing overnight stay would stay there again
