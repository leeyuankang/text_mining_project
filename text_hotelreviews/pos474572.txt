myself and my girlfriend visited milan for the first time earlier this week and had chosen to stay in the lagare hotel based on its reviews online the hotel is very appealing from the outside with the multi coloured windows and the lobby also very grand we were welcomed and checked in early and given lots of information by the friendly front desk staff our room double was superb a very modern seclusive and cosy room large comfortable bed large flat screen modern led tv with skytv and clean wooden floors the room was fitted with numerous switches for convenience with multiple lighting modes and automatic window shutters the bathroom was just as good with a large double walk in shower with a very cool overhead water fountain and run away draining on the floor speaker system fitted into the bathroom allowed us to play music from the tv in the bathroom awesome the room had lots of amenities free bottled water a mini bar free wireless internet and toiletries the hotel is around minute walk from the beating heart of milan but still has restaurants and bars within minutes of the hotel and is only a minute walk from the milan central station we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel we had a drink in the chilled bar area but sadly did not get to try the restaurant terrace or spa this time we would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to stay in milan in style
