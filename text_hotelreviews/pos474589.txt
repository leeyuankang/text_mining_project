absolutely one of the best hotels i have ever stayed for this price range clean and modern hotel and room the staff were so friendly and professional when they made us wait for c hour to check in because their wifi was down they treated us with free wines at the bar they definitely managed the difficult situation well i also stayed other hotels in milan but this is by far the best
