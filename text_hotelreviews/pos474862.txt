the room was spacious and clean the restaurant downstairs has decent food and the prices are reasonable although it is not ideally located it is not difficult or expensive to get to it from public transport in the city the train is a minute walk from the hotel they will book a shuttle for you but you must ask in advance the wellness center was under renovation but i m sure once finished that will add value to the stay they also gave me a handy smart phone for the duration of the stay which was a surprise i offered helpful advice free international calling maps etc as wifi was hard to access without an italian number or international texts this was helpful for getting around you delete all the data before you leave but don t lose it or you ll pay the cost of the phone
