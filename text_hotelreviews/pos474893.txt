the hotel was lovely the staff were friendly and helpful rooms nice and fantastic shower the listing says free shuttle to certosa station and rho fiera milano but we weren t offered that we were told how to walk there when i enquired at reception bit disappointed with that bit it didn t affect our pleasant stay
