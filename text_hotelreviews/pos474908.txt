hotel was bright modern and although not central there is a free shuttle bus to from the local train station very clean food is good drinks are reasonably priced too loved the modern design of the bedroom the shower being in the middle was a bit different we had a problem with the toilet and it was repaired straight away fresh orange juice cool water in reception area which is very welcome after a long day out good customer service all round the hotel is close to a cinema complex which also has a few restaurants which is good if you don t want to go too far in the evening
