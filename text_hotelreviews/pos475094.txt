the hotel feels very homely with thought put into the little details such as good china and quality decor it s positioned well there is metro just around the corner and if you re feeling up to it the walk down the main avenue into milan is a delight the breakfast was very good with the added option to eat al fresco in there wonderful garden i d definitely stay again home from home
