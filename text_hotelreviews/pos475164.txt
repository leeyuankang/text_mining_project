i liked the style of the hotel the room was nice but the bathroom was tiny not what you expect from star hotel it was nice to have a balcony the breakfast was good with large variety perfect hot croissants lots of fruits fresh juices etc however last breakfast was a mess there were no glasses cups and plates the staff was not quick enough to replace the missing items had to wait for water for minutes the hotel is situated in the nice area close to metro a huge supermarket is nearby the staff is very well trained and any request is immediately realised
