quite good value for money hotel around this area perfect position in the center of london and very close to soho visiting everything by foot the staff was very kind and willing to help i don t know about the food or breakfast because i didn t order but it seems to be good from what i saw the room was old but it was comfortable and seems to be clean they change towels and bathroom soaps everyday the room has nice view no problem with noise no problem with the beds
