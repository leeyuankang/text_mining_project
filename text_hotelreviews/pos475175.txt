we really liked the hotel itself clean beautiful rooms nice and friendly stuff we were very lucky to experience this hotel during our first visit to milan the location is very nice only few minutes till metro station and yellow line wich goes straight to duomo takes about minutes to get there but if you don t enjoy public transportation it would be very expensive with taxi to get to the center in that case you might choose something closer
