the hotel is a very nice building recently renewed a bit far from the center but very close to the metro station from where you can reach duomo square in min the first impact was wonderful the personnel at the reception was very gentle and kind always smiling extremely professional and efficient taking care of all our requests and possible needs it is really rare to find such an accueil the room was very nice modern design very comfortable with a very good view on the surrounding from the highest floor included breakfast was rich and tasty i surely recommend this hotel amd i will come back next i will visit milan
