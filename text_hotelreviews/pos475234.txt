the breakfast was really good we enjoyed the italian hand made cakes every morning it is a clean hotel and wifi works fast you need to walk apx minutes to affori centro metro station and on this line you can reach to main railway station and duomo without changing line and another plus at our room is that there was a microwave to warm your foods
