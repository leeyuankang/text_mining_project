room was surprisingly large and modern for heart of milan this is right around the corner from la scala and the domo staff was helpful called taxi for me directions were good etc and breakfast was very good big buffet with options only nit was that the people in the room above evidently felt the need to rearrange the furniture frequently between the hours of and midnight resulting in lots of noise in my room i finally called the front desk and surprisingly the noise stopped
