the staff were just lovely and couldn t do enough to help us even taking furniture out of the room so i had more room in my wheelchair we had quite a lot of furniture in our room and we needed three beds our first stay we got upgraded and had a wonderful room a great start to our holiday the manager had the right level of friendliness helpfulness but aurthority i wish i could have taken him to other hotels to show them this is how you run a hotel breakfast was good they could have been a little friendlier but they were busy this hotel is in a wonderful position and i would have no reservation in recommending it we have stayed in milan often but this will be the hotel we go back to
