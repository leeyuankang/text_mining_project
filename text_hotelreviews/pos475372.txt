absolutely loved this hotel and our trip to milan we took advantage of all the hotel had to offer not sure why there were weak reviews of breakfast on some of the other forums but i loved the breakfast that was offered so much better than anything in the uk the pool area was perfect for some weekend sunshine my husband and i burned it s a small pool area but quiet enough the room was a good size for europe with a comfortable bed location is perfect no need for a cab other than from the train station though i m sure you could take the metro we were fairly short on time no complaints would definitely stay here again
