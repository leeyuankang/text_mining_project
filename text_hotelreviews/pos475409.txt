amazing location close to the duomo but far enough away to feel quiet the triple room was cosy for three of us travelled with our daughter but very beautifully decorated and it would have been a fine size for two the bathroom was also nicely decorated and exceptionally clean the breakfast buffet was one of the best i ve ever seen
