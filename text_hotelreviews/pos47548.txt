the hotel is central and in easy reach of all parts of central london right beside the bbc transport is good and there are plenty of places to eat nearby iberica in gt portland st is especially good the room was clean and the bed comfortable we were on the floor so had great views over london the bar restaurant on the floor looks good too although it was nearly empty on the evening we were there and we only had a drink so can t comment on the food staff were friendly and helpful
