tony the concierge was extremely helpful as we had taxi issues on our return trip to the airport tony did everything he could to help us get back in time to the airport you cant get more central than there beds are comfy and recommend a room on the hotel entrance side rooms are from the floor up so you definitely avoid possible noise also eventhough its just right off oxford circus there is no noise would go there again for sure
