we were very happy with the stay and i must say i ve never slept better in a hotel bed before in addition the quality of the breakfast surprised us really nice food and a wide variety we did encounter a power shortage in the room cause unknown not that it matters we contacted the lobby and they sent a member of staff to check it out we literally waited no more than seconds before he was at our room big thumbs up from a couple of satisfied danish guests
