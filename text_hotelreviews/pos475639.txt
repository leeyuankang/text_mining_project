we have stayed several times at this property it is located in a pleasant area with many locals and residences in the streets nearby there are excellent restaurants and access to the subway system is very convenient if you prefer to walk and window shop then the duomo can be reached in about minutes the hotel is not lavish but it is clean pleasant and recently refurbished book a superior room if you want more space the breakfasts are good
