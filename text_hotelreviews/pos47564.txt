could not have picked a better location for the price the view alone was worth the money we spent consider that we were on the floor and our room overlooked london from the west to the southwest we could see london eye westminster abbey tower of london full view of the shard partial view of the gherkin and could look down and see oxford street shopping shopping shopping awesome location decent price for a downtown hotel
