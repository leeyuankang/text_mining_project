we stayed for one night in the una mediterraneo what we really liked was the breakfast tasty and fresh huge selection and the friendly and helpful staff who helped us with the luggage wifi worked well and was free the room was not big but very clean and comfortable with air condition and a big and nice bathroom at night is was very quiet although the hotel is quite central and one is almost next to the subway we definitely recommend
