located right in the heart of the old city barri gotic couldn t beat the location we changed rooms and got one that directly faced the old roman wall what a view especially when it is lit up in lights concierge was especially helpful getting us taxis very tough during the rush hours and letting us know when we should be going to various attractions so we wouldn t have to wait in line
