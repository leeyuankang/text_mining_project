we were very happy with the hotel staff were very accommodating and friendly the room was compact compared to the hotel we had just come from the night before but it was nice to have a full double bed instead of two twins pushed together and the bathroom was well appointed the location is great close to the beach some great restaurants and the ramblas catalunya
