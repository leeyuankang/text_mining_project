perfect location we were a bit apprehensive after reading recent negative reviews but luckily they couldn t be further from the truth staff were very pleasant and the glass of prosecco on arrival was a nice touch it can be a little noisy from street outside but if you want a central location then don t be surprised and or complain no idea what people are talking about as far as dirty rooms and bad smells are concerned didn t affect us this hotel was in the best location near all major sites and gothic quarter is wonderful
