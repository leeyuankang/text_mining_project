this is our second stay at the grand hotel central we enjoyed our stay the first time so much we were more than happy to return and stay a second time we love the location of the hotel it s very central to all the sites of barcelona you are walking distance to the beach la boqueria food market the gothic area el born etc the price of the hotel is worth it for the location the room is very clean comfortable and modern the staff are extremely helpful and professional we were pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade to a larger room even during high season highly recommended
