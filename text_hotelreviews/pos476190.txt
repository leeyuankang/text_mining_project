while the hotel itself is certainly among the best ones i have ever seen breath taking view from the rooftop delicious breakfast spacious rooms comfy lobby free cava champagne in the mornings among other things the service quality was absolutely beyond anything i had ever experienced from the initial pre check in reception all the way to post check out assistance all crew members were going the extra mile at all times to make sure our stay was a delight i would like to give my special thanks to alonso the doorman who s full of excellent tourism ideas that are unlikely to be found in travel guides every time he saw us he was always so positive and proactive and on multiple occasions suggested fantastic ways to spend our time in barcelona his humor and enthusiasm are unique and contagious overall by far the best hotel choice in catalonia and great value for money
