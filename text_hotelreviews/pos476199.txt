exceptional service and location this was the most comfortable bed we slept in during our city tour of spain i was pleasantly surprised by the multi course dinner special at the restaurant for hotel guests pp it was advertised as courses and a drink for euro per person we ended up getting extra snacks and an extra glass of wine given to us and the free drink was any cocktail on their list not some cheap cava that you might expect as the freebie at a lot of the restaurants in town
