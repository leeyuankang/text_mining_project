good location in the gothic district of barcelona this hotel caters to a hip chic traveler the room was basic but comfortable with all amenities you would expect at an upscale plus star hotel the sky bar on the rooftop was relaxing place to sit and view the city with an infinity pool and lounge area the restaurant downstairs was very good and inexpensive for the quality of the food
