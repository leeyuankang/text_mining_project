this hotel was in an excellent location adjacent to the el born neighborhood the staff was all very friendly and they all spoke english upon check in the manager upgraded our room which we thought was fabulous the room was fantastic and had incredible roll down shades inside the windows to block out all the city light the room was super spacious even compared to us standards we had a separate tub and shower area the rooftop pool and lounge area with bar was an added bonus with an incredible view of the city we had cocktails there twice during our stay i highly recommend this hotel
