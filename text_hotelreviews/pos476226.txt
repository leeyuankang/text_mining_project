our whole experience was delightful the hotel was a dream everything is run like clockwork we had no need to contact staff about anything the location is excellent the hotel is beautifully presented it is glamorous yet understated and not pretentious i travelled with my year old and we both felt very comfortable the room was great the bathroom was top notch the highlight will always be the roof and pool but the whole package is excellent i cannot fault a thing
