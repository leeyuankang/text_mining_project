the location was very good the room we got first was a bit noisy from the street as it only had double glazed windows thanks to the very friendly manager mrs alisha we could change to another room which was refurbished very quiet and had a great view we also liked to have drinks in the bar restaurant at the top an extra plus was the choice of various breakfast types such as the express breakfast
