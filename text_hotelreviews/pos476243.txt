all the staff were very friendly and helpful we arrived into barcelona early in the morning and went straight to the hotel to drop our bags off on arrival we were allowed to check in early which was really appreciated the location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the city the views from the roof bar were lovely and i really liked the modern decor inside the bed was really comfy with a good bathroom too the breakfast although pricey was probably the best hotel breakfast my husband and i have had a huge variety of foods and all fresh and well cooked preserved the cocktails in the bar were excellent too our flight home to geneva was cancelled at the last minute and we couldn t rebook our flights until two days later so we returned to the hotel to check in for another two nights on our return the staff were very sympathetic and treated us to an upgrade which was fantastic we also used the hotel s car service to the airport and the driver was very friendly too the hotel really went along way to ensuring my husband and i had a lovely decadent few days away
