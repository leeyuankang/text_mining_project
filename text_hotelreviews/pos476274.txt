a true star experience but with a very homely feel thanks to the welcoming and helpful staff location of the hotel was perfect for all quarters of the city and easy to access the metro excellent food city bar very relaxing and good value whilst the rooftop skybar offered fabulous views over the illuminated if rather chilly late october after all pool nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the front desk in the bars or at the front door the quality of the hotel made a great holiday even better
