got a room on the floor streetside but quiet and very comfortable the bathroom had a window to the other side which was quite nice too the hotel is perfect for exploring barcelona it is very near the cathedral and directly at the start of the gothic quarter it is also only a minutes walk to the harbour so you can reach a lot of great places by walking
