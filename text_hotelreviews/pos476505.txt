location is amazing we were able to check in early at which was great value for money the bed was comfy strong shower and nice bathroom free bottles of water a day were great staff were nice clean room but could definitely do with a paint update the cleaners gave us fresh towels daily overall a good hotel to stay in for a weekend away
