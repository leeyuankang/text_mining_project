our two favorite things about the hotel were the location and the rooftop pool lounge we were in barcelona for days and only had to take a taxi twice park guell and the w for a drink for most tourist attractions we were able to walk i would definitely stay in this location again however the best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool it has amazing views great drinks and is very relaxing the perfect way to spend a couple of hours in between tourist activities and a night out on the town we would absolutely stay at ohla barcelona again
