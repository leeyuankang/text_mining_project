we liked the decoration dark theme with a mix of shiny matt materials and art room was comfortable loved the dimmable hanging egg lights bathroom was clean and stylish with a concealed toilet door very neat staff was great also the rooftop bar was windy and refreshing after sweating the whole day in the city good cocktails served and the tapas restaurant really worth a visit
