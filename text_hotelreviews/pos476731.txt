the hotel is stunning and in the perfect location for exploring barcelona the highlight is the wonderful roof terrace with pool the staff on reception went over and above to help us on arrival the lady who looked after us had already noted we were both vegetarian she took the time and effort to point out on a map approx vegetarian and vegan restaurants she could recommend we were also thrilled to find a bottle of bubbly on ice in our room one day as they had also noted we were on honeymoon these little touchs make all the difference room and bathroom very spacious would definitely recommend
