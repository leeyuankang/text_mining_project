ohla barcelona was one of the the best hotels we have stayed we had the junior suite which was beautiful looking out to the city the staff were so friendly and helpful we loved that they turned down our room each night and re stocked the water and left a different treat the hotel was in such a great location in east walking distance to all the main attractions the rooftop pool was excellent for relaxing in the afternoon however there is limited space for seats we would definitely stay at ohla barcelona again
