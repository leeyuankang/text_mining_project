great location short walk to la rambla gothic quarter pleasant staff but seems understaff with the amount of guests especially slow response from housekeeping bell the mezzanine check in is a bit off when you travel from far have to take luggages upstairs the breakfast offerings are great so is the beautiful rooftop
