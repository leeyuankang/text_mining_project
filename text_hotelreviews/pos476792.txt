beautiful hotel in a great location the quality of service and the standard of the room was fantastic great attention to detail with some lovely touches such as the night time chocolates on the bed the staff were extremely attentive but not too overpowering also we were given a complimentary bottle of fizz to celebrate a birthday which was another lovely touch
