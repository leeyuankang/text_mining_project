the hotel is worth it if you get a good deal clean great location modern rooms i found that the day breakfast price is just exorbitant however i found that its much cheaper and a much better experience to just order your breakfast in the room the night before the hotel staff seems kind and motivated to help which is very good even though the pool is smaller than expected and the view less overwhelming than suggested it is still a wonderful and premium experience i recommend thank you for a good stay
