the concierges all of them were amazing fabulous service fabulous recommendations they took such great care of us and the staff at reception first rate the rooftop pool and the view were fantastic the food at the hotel is incredible don t miss it and the location is great right in the middle of the city walking distance to just about everything despite some of the negative comments i made i would stay here again i just would ask for a room on a higher floor i definitely recommend this hotel
