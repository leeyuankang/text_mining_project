this was a trip to celebrate my husbands so we wanted something a little more special and i can honestly say ohla did not disappoint right from when we arrived the staff went out of their way a nice glass of fizz as a welcome and they held our bags so we could go off and explore the city while our room was being prepared the bar man camilo upstairs gave us hints on where to visit tapas cocktail bars etc and the bar we found was the best cocktail bar we ve ever been in crepe el born we arrived back to the room to a complimentary bottle of cava from the hotel for hubbys birthday and some gorgeous chocs room was cleaned exceptionally every day and the staff were always happy to guide us to where we wanted to go even smelt nice everywhere on our last day we had a later check out and staff held onto our bags as we had an evening flight so we could enjoy our last few hours when we returned we were allowed to use the gym area to shower before our flight and chill in the bar days in the city flew by but we had the best time and ohla definitely made it one to remember can t thank the staff and management enough we will definitely be back
