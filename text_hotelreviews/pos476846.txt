the bed was comfy the location was brilliant as it was a short walk away from some great places the staff were very kind friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was as good as possible the housekeeping was amazing as every day we were provided fresh towels sometimes twice a day and it was a nice little touch by the maids for putting a little chocolate treat on our freshly made bed
