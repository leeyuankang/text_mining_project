the location is incredible most things are within walking distance the gothic quarter cathedral beach and there are great transport links to areas which are a little bit further out the staff were lovely very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful we only ate breakfast in the restaurant but the food was good and staff couldn t do enough for us the views from the rooftop pool and bar are stunning and the cocktail bar is definitely worth a visit too perfect for a long weekend in an amazing city
