from the time we arrived to the time we left the service provided was excellent nothing seemed much for the staff who were always available to make our stay as enjoyable and memorable as possible they succeeded the location is perfect with numerous shops and restaurants within easy walking distance yet the rooms were extremely quiet the roof top pool and bar was most enjoyable a wonderful relaxing and enjoyable stay
