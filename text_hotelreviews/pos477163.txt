nice english speaking staff and good location minute walk from the central station with great restaurants in the area try the ricci a little bit expensive or the sushimi cheap and quick the standard double room has enough space and is comfy and clean the area is calm at night and secure breakfast buffet was fine with enough choice for a few nights their underground parking is beside the hotel with a keeper and video camera and costs euros hours
