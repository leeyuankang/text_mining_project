our room was really spacious clean and comfy it was a great place to stay at the end our week trip around italy staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was excellent with a great selection of fresh food the hotel is close to stazione central shopping and walking distance to the hop on off bus stop on corso buenos aires we would recommend dinner at mamma rosa s just a couple of blocks from the hotel fabulous dining experience and food
