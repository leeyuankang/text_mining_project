really enjoyed our stay at this hotel only a minute walk from reppublic metro station and minutes from centrale train station a few bars and restaurants near by the hotel room was clean and comfortable and the air conditioning was very welcome as it was really hot during our stay was really impressed with how quiet the hotel was no banging doors from inside and no traffic noises outside which enabled us to have restful sleep the staff were friendly and spoke very good english the breakfast bar was outstanding it had everything you could wish for and tasted delicious would recommend this hotel and would stay here again
