probably one of the best all round value hotels in central milan customer service excellent markedly better than anything i ve encountered elsewhere in italy smart modern hotel in good location walking distance to the town centre secure spacious and clean underground parking good breakfast very competitive price through booking com regrettably didn t get the names of all the staff to acknowledge them but sara and her colleagues on the front desk were especially helpful and impressively fluent in several languages
