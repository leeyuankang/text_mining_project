the location it was perfect it allows me to move around the city so easily the subway station was literally just minutes away by walk and just half an hour from the rho fiera station what was really perfect since i was attending the salone del mobile also the central station was a minutes walk what it is great to get in and out of the city the breakfast was amazing many options to choose from clena an spacious room and very quiet allowing a great night sleep
