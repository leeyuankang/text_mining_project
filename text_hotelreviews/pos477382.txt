i booked a room at this hotel because unlike many other hotels in milano their staff seemed very polite according to reviews well my girl friend and me were certainly not disappointed every single staff member be it receptionist waiter or cleaning personnel were really friendly and helpful thats very important to me and made me feel welcome the hotel was also managed very profesionally when my girl friend pulled a misterious string in the shower cabin shortly later someone from the reception would call and ask if everything was ok turned out it was an alarm you could use in case of an emergency they also called another day to ask if we need anything e g a fresh towel we had put out the do not distrub sign english is no problem in that hotel they speak it fluently you can also store your luggage at the hotel for free on the day you check out in case you still have time to explore the city but no place to leave your stuff the room we had was very nice clean and quiet i dont need any luxuries but that s what matters to me we also got a free upgrade which was a great surprise beds were comfy breakfast was certainly ok i have seen buffets with a broader selection though coffee was excellent hotel is located close to a tram stop and a metro stop all in all a very pleasant stay and would come back anytime
