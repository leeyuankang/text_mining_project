brilliant location excellent staff room cleaned every day with fresh coffee and tea couldn t have asked for anything more visited for new years eve and we went to the hotels heights bar after our meal in savile row and the hotel staff allowed us to go into the fire exit to see the fireworks it was brilliant could not recommend enough
