i have stayed in this hotel already many times i have noticed with pleasure that there were some improvements bathroom was modernised there was a water boiling kettle in the room breakfast was also better with goji berries sesame and flax seed to add to your muesli staff very friendly and helpful good value for money will definitely come again and again
