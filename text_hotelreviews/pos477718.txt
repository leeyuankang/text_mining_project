the location of the hotel is surprisingly good for hopping on the tram to the centre of milan the neighbourhood is not especially interesting but there was a park under construction so will possibly improve beautiful quiet garden lovely traditional italian food and really warm and welcoming staff excellent for a business trip where you want some peace and quiet after a day s work
