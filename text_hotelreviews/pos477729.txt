if you travel by car this is hotel is very good easy to access the highway and has a free parking there is a running cycling path just outside hotel navigli restaurants are very near centre can be reached by tram in spring summer the hotel s courtyard is a big plus we also had dinner at the hotel s restaurant the food is fresh and tasty i have stayed here several times already and will come again the hotel is rather simple but staff is very friendly they even provide plug in mosquito repellent which was very useful in may
