bus stop is right outside the hotel bus number takes you to the city centre and drops you just outside the castle two receptionists that i dealt with were helpful and welcoming lots of free parking area around the hotel i also liked that there was a flatscreen tv and accompanied a printed guide to channels in many languages very good breakfast lots of options to choose from thoughtful but low quality toiletries in the bathroom
