the hotel is really nice it s new and modern it s located in a very residential part of milan which worried me at first but traveling to the city center took about so it wasn t too bad plus it was very safe i had the best breakfast every day at this local bakery minutes away from the hotel i enjoyed seeing the locals interact with each other at the bakery instead of seeing a bunch of tourists it definitely makes the travel experience better because you get a taste of how it is to live there i was also very surprised by the size of the hotel room it was really spacious
