the hotel is very clean and nice bathroom is big and modern and beds and pillows are very comfortable internet connection is good and stable there is plenty of food choices for breakfast although they served the same kind of food during our night stay the hotel itself is a bit far from the centre but it is very close to a metro station so going to and from the city centre is easy if you don t mind the distance then i highly recommend this hotel
