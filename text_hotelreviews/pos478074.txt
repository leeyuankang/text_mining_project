breakfast good restaurant staff friendly room was clean bathroom good and bed comfortable the main problem is front of house staff and location advertised as convenient for teatro arcimboldi not so but disinterested and unfriendly reception staff does not add to ones impression of this hotel basic budget hotel off the beaten track with little atmosphere no desire to return not what i expected of a hilton
