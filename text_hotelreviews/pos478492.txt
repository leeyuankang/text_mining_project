the hotel is very close to milano centrale station the main station so it is convenient for us to take day trip to como and cinque terre the room and the bed is big and comfortable it was told that free wifi is only available at common area and it will cost for wifi at room however the reception offers a free membership for registration with the compliment of free wifi so actually the wifi is free we book the hotel late so the price is beleived to be with discount the fibal price is about per night invluding vat and city tax for the standard double room which i think the original price should be around city tax not included the area around thr hotel looks safe especially comparing with the milano centrale station at the station there are army standby at night
