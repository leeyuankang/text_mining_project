the distance to the train station is very convenient generally the area around the train station does not feel very safe but the street where the hotel is is very nice and quiet the room was huge and clean the bed was comfortable well isolated the breakfast was very good some of the staff members are real pearls who make you feel very welcome there was a hick up in communications prior to my arrival however my request was eventually resolved in a very professional and respectable manner which i highly appreciated
