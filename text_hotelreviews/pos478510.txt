very good staff the receptionist called nanchi was really nice and gave us the room early at noon even though check in time was later at we were very grateful as we were tired from our trip from athens early morning that day rooms were clean and comfortable and upto standard of hilton concierge was also good and gave us correct guidance this hotel is value for money as they offer rooms at a good price compared to other hotels in milan in my opinion
