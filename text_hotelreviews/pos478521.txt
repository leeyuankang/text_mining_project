the location and amenities of hilton hotels was very well known to me well before staying for two nights in the hotel of hilton milan the hotel is within a short walking distance from centrale station of milan where you could get metro tickets to duomo and other beautiful neighborhoods such as zara the bed was comfortable and the shower has a temperature regulator with written instruction which i thought was superb the restaurant was nice and their staff were nice
