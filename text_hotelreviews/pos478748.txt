first room offered had a horrible smell of cleaning products complained and requested a change of room after a not so helpful dialogue with an attendant at the desk my issue was handled by the manager who efficiently and courteously gave us a nicer larger room with no smell hotel is a great deal for the price well located with nice installations and efficient service included breakfast was nice and on a sunny day can be taken in the hotel garden later i was also able to verify the hotel also counts with an equally efficient manager for their restaurant
