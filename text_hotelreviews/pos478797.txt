we stayed in a park view room with a cute balcony to which they upgraded at our second night stay upon our request the front office manager was really helpful when last night we came back to our room there was a bottle of prosecco and snacks on table which they ve organized for my mum s birthday it was a really nice gesture the location is excellent it takes apr minutes walk to via montenapoleone and to other nice streets
