we liked the location near piazza cavour which is just outside the centro storico the hotel is across from a public park which lends an air of tranquility which we appreciate at the end of a busy day of sightseeing and shopping la scala il duomo la pinacoteca di brera and of course the quadrilateral di moda are all within easy walking distance the breakfast buffet is on the back side of the hotel facing a tranquil garden
