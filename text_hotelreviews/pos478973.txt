the staff at grand hotel et milan are amazing they are kind friendly and so courteous we stayed at the superior suite which was beautifully decorated and impeccably maintained would definitely return to this hotel if i were to come back to milan the location is perfect the duomo and vittorio emmanuele galleria are a short min walk from the hotel
