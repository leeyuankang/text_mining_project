excellent service my wife and i chose to celebrate our wedding anniversary over a long weekend and were very pleasantly surprised as we had not experienced this level of service in western europe for quite some time we would even compare their level of perfectionism to one our favourite hotels in st barth s the front desk staff were not only attentive but seemed to anticipate our needs one of the concierge massimo was exceptional in his choices of restaurants for us from perfectly authentic northern italian gastronomy to exceptional fresh fish the other obvious luxury was of course the prime location so close to everything yet far away enough to avoid noise and concentration of tourists we had a fantastic stay and will look forward to returning to grand hotel et de milano
