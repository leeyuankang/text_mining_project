the hotel is quite luxurious and the service is impeccable and very helpful the location is a little outside the center though very close walking distance to the lotto subway station on metro lines and we found a couple of restaurants in the neighborhood we tried one the pizza from a wood fired oven was quite good we could see the san siro stadium from our balcony they offer a lot of choices for the breakfast buffet and all of them seemed very high quality
