the room for a star hotel was absolutely basic and bare it would compare to a star hotel room in my country south africa stayed in star hotels throughout italy on this vacation and the melia hotel room was the worst it was very depressing being in that room the pictures shown on the website are not a true reflection of the room very far from the main attractions the breakfast was good though and made up for part of our terrible stay at this hotel
