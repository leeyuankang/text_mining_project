firstly the reception staff were very pleasant always willing to help and continually smiling secondly we were upgraded and the room had a small balcony where you could you sit out each morning and have a leisurely breakfast the room was spacious with a very nice bathroom thirdly the option to order breakfast and have it delivered to your room is an added bonus and well worth selecting this option you get a good choice of items finally the location is excellent for getting around would definitely recommend to others and would stay there again for sure
