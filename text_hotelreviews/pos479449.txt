we stayed overnight the location is fantastic less than the piazza that faces the duomo and the galleria the room was nice sized well furnished had a great bathroom and and was very quiet in spite of the fact that we were on the floor and facing a busy street the staff were very helpful in arranging transportation and restaurant reservations we wish we could had stayed longer
