i liked the everything comfortable room bathroom was large enough and had a bath separately with ocean salt the hotel offers types of pillow which is really make comfortable your sleep the room is very clean and nice we had a room with balcony to duomo piazza the only problem is that the hotel does not have a restaurant and in order to have your breakfast you have to make order till am they bring it to the room this creates a problem because you do not know what time you wake up next day in this case you have to plan your wake up you may also order in the morning but it takes min to prepare and bring to your room also the small table in the room is not comfortable to have a breakfast on it therefore the next day i preferred to have a good coffee and some wonderful cakes and croissants at crunchy pastry near the hotel bear in mind that hotel mostly has king size bedrooms and with only duvet cover it is not really comfortable if you sleep with child
