this really is a gem of a find in the centre of everything the staff on arrival gave us both an upgrade the room as are so divine it is hard to leave the the staff are super friendly helpful and truly lovely people i had so much fun staying here the location was ideal for us as a couple and we could walk to most places the shopping is literally around the corner from the hotel so you will never need to carry your bags around all day the staff arranged for me to have my hair and nails done locally at last minute which was so wonderful i would book this hotel in a heart beat again
