great location near grayling good restaurants the galleria and church having sound proof windows were a must and were very nice because there is street noise the staff was very friendly and helpful with providing city information in room breakfast was nice too only negative comment is the pillows are hard and not comfortable for me the executive room was very clean big bathroom and nicely decorated would stay here again
