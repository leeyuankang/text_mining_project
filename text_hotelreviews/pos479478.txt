it s a very beautiful hotel in the center of milano so you can go easily everywhere shop anything you like eat everything you like and visit the area around and the square people are very helpful and friendly most of them speak english the rooms are very nice and clean nice showers and plenty of comfort items we had a simple room and the junior suite room i think that the simple room was actually better than the suite because the suite was very long and and the bathroom was on the other side of the room it has a nice view and you and nice design
