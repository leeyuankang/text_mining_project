the hotel is very close to linate airport and the journey to from the airport only took about minutes although it should be noted that there was no traffic at the times i was travelling the shuttle service is free but you need to phone the hotel when you have collected your bags at the airport to let them know you are waiting note that the shuttle is not a hour service the times are given on booking com s website the room was clean and comfortable and quite spacious with tea coffee making facilities i would recommend this hotel to travellers who need to make an overnight stop near linate airport but not for those who plan to stay in milan to see the city s sights as it s a bit too far from the centre for that
