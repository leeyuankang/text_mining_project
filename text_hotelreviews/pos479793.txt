we stayed in this hotel the night before an early department flight from milan the hotel is excellent and the service from the hotel staff is undoubedly the best we have ever received a courtesy shuttle bus is provided to transfer you from the hotel to the airport and runs every i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering booking it with a rating for service facilities and location to airport
