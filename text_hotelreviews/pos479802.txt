very pleasantly surprised with the novotel the design of the rooms and public areas were fantastic and the added bonus of pool and lovely restaurant was very much appreciated staff were very friendly and helpful shuttle bus to the airport was useful we booked for the last night of our holiday before flight home but wish we were staying longer
