the quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise the location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants i cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone
