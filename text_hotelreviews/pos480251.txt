we chose this property for our first night in italy after a long overseas flight due to its close proximity to the milan central train station where we planned to take a train to florence the next day our room size was typical by european standards small but the king bed was very comfortable and the efficient modern room design provided more than enough space for our needs the bathroom was exceptionally clean modern and had a great shower we also appreciated the electric kettle and small minibar the breakfast offered an excellent buffet with a good selection of eggs fruit yoghurt ham cheese pastries and really good coffee we would stay here again
