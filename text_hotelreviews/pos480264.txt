amazing location directly beside the sondrio metro stop staff are very friendly and helpful we got complimentary umbrellas to keep dry on our visit and complimentary use of the spa wellness centre and also a selection of nibbles when you order something from the bar it is on a busy street but the windows are almost sound proof we will definitely be back
