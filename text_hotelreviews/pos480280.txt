probably the best breakfast in whole stay in italy lots of choices there were also hot meals like scrambled eggs or bacons even oriental food with rice very friendly staff very clean and comfortable bed stylish interior good hair dryer got a very nice little aroma set for a good night sleep underground station is just under the hotel we stayed just for one night but we could have stayed much more
