brilliant buffet breakfast well worth the junior suite room was perfect and even had our own little rooftop terrace location right next door to sondrio underground station literally mins to duomo centre hotel was minutes walk from milan centrale station again ideal transfers from malpensa airport staff were excellent helpful and friendly i made them aware it was my girlfriends birthday before booking they included free breakfast for us both and put a box of chocolates with a message in our room to wish her a happy birthday i also think they gave us free additions from the mini bar on her birthday as they didn t charge us couldn t fault anything about the hotel room clean modern spacious with everything you could need even free robes and slippers the sauna and steam room was lovely also and included within the stay wifi was consistently good throughout will definitely recommend both milan as a city and this hotel to my friends thinking of going
