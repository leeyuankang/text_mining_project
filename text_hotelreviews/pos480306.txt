we stayed at the crowne plaza milan city for nights we are a family of four so i got two interconnecting rooms the rooms were modern and the beds were very comfortable i love the way the rooms were decorated the bathroom was very clean staff were friendly i also love the location it was on top of the sondrio subway station yellow line it only took minutes to get to the duomo which was the stop it was also close to milano centrale when we checked in at pm one of our rooms weren t ready yet the front desk offered another room for us to stay in while waiting but i declined our rate didn t include free breakfast so he gave it to us to compensate for the wait for the other room we really loved our stay here
