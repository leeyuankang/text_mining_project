excellent value for money the location looks wise can feel a little dingy but it s not too bad and there are several excellent chinese restaurants around if you fancy a change in cuisine it s still walkable to the city centre but after a long day sightseeing and shopping in milan even i a keen walker rather than public transport driving didn t fancy the walk back howevere public transport was excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was perfectly airconditioned large and had a very comfy bed
