breakfast was great with amazing scrambled eggs and bacon along with all the usual breads cheeses etc the hotel is located in chinatown so you if you like asian food and grocery then this is perfect for you the bed was huge and we had a room for three so they had an extra bed in the room which we didn t need the extra bed took up most of the living space
