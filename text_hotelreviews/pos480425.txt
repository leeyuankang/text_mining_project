the decor and styling of the rooms easy to get in to see the sights of milan on a tram felt to be in a safe location and very easy to get a taxi the rooms were clean and is one of the few hotels that actually abide by the environmental standards and don t take every used towel they left the towels i hung up on the hook as per the enviro guidelines and i think that this is a great thing
