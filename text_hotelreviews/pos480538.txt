the room respectively the whole hotel is period style not really old it only appears that way our room was on the floor no chance to open a window constant noise from the traffic and passing street cars was deafening until late room was nicely furnished a bit crammed maybe we even had a small kitchenette with a fridge bathroom was ok too breakfast is buffet style good selection plenty to choose from coffee is good
