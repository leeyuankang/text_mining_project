the hotel is in a very good position for walking to the duomo and the navgli area and for public transport to all areas of the city and beyond the staff were so friendly and helpful with anything we needed we were upgraded to a suite on the third floor on arrival which was spacious comfortable and very clean there was tea coffee making facilities and a fridge which was nice to come back to after a day out we especially liked the little card left in our room giving the weather forecast for the next day for a city centre hotel it was surprisingly quiet
