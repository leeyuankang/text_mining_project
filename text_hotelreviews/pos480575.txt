a charming small boutique hotel with so much character the room was spacious with a lovely ambience and the little courtyard with its lovely plants and quaint furnishings a delight all the staff were very friendly and most helpful with any queries as well as arranging the airport transfer the location was ok about a minute stroll to the centre and even walking alone at night in the district i felt safe very good selection for the buffet breakfast beautifully presented and of a high quality a most attentive waitress who greeted me each morning as a most welcome guest
