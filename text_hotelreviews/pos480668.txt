it was very close to the center and the dumo the hotel itself was very clean and the staff at reception was very nice this hotel is ok if you just want somewhere to sleep for a night the rooms were basic but clean and comfortable close to some very nice restraunts the hotel could do with a face lift to be honest but on the whole our stay was ok
