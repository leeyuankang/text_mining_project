older little boutique style hotel staff were very friendly there were gentlemen working at the front desk while we were there and all went above and beyond when we asked for any help they even helped us book train tickets to france rooms are small but thats not unusual for europe however they were very clean breakfast was free and the selection was nice facilities like a good iron and a hair dryer that you can actually dry your hair with was great if you re looking for a cheaper option in a good location minutes walk to the duomo and not too fussed about old decor i would recommend it
