located less than minutes away from the duomo on a small quiet square next to the la scala academy the hotel has gone through a complete refurbishment and the rooms look much better than a look form the outside might suggest i had a single fairly small room which was nevertheless very comfortable and had everything i needed the bed was good pillows and linens were soft and clean there was enough light in the evening the bathroom was refurbished nicely as well very good hairdryer wifi worked ok enough considering the overall quality of italian internet the staff was nice
