nice location right in the middle of things we were in milan overnight so location was important our room was clean comfy with two full length mirrors and hooks to hang coats we had a desk chairs and a good closet bathroom was good with a shower in the bath tub like i prefer i can t rate breakfast as we had to leave too early to catch our train also if you are not a stair person there are very few stairs for you to navigate i would definitely stay here again
