this hotel is literally a five minute walk away from milan cathedral which is the heart of the city this makes it really easy to have a relaxed late night walk around the main square which was great the room was clean quiet and comfortable despite it being very warm outside the temperature in the room was very pleasant so that was a bonus the wifi was very good and despite being advertised as being paid it was provided for free which was a nice bonus for me often free wifi is slow but this was very fast
