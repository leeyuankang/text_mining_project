the room was actually bigger than i booked it had a kitchen but no plates or pots which made it unuseful but everything else was good it was clean the towels were changed every day the breakfast was really awesome i add one extra point for an out of charge printer in the hall where we printed our tickets to sum up it s a nice place it s located pretty far away from the certer but metro station is really close so for us it wasn t a problem and lidl store is close by which was good
