the staff was friendly and they gave us plates and cups electric kettle and pots so if you want to make food you need to ask kitchen utensill yourself the bed was nice big enough and mattress was comfortable so it was ok to sleep when the air conditioning was working we had big balcon but it would have been nice to have there also chairs the room was clean good location near metro wifi functioned well
