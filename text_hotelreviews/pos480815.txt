appartment rooms with kitchen living room type of space and windows which open to a balcony made this a perfect place to stay exellent and friendly staff plus incredibly affordable stars for value for money no this is not the most tastefully done boutique hotel but to me it ticked all boxes space to work good bed windows which can open clean quiet completely comfortable
