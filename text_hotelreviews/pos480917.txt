a vast and delicious buffet to suit everyone s taste attractively displayed and delicious a small hotel efficient and welcoming staff just what we like convenient for central railway station restaurants close by a little out of the main area and the duomo but that is easily accessible by the metro we had a quiet room which suited us would stay there again without hesitation
