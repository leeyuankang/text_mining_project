all the staff were extremely pleasant welcoming and helpful despite being a longstanding city hotel the room was modern light and airy and the bathroom was clean and bright the bed was very comfortable the location close to the central station was excellent and whilst a good walk from the very centre of milan the metro was only minutes away cheap and efficient the hotel was surrounded by some good restaurants and one in particular that was recommended to us which was excellent the breakfast fayre was excellent and whilst the dining area was busy it was well ordered by the numerous waiting staff who were at pains to make sure we enjoyed a hearty breakfast from the buffet
