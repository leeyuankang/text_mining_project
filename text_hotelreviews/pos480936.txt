hotel berna is conveniently located a short walk from milano centrale train station and metro lines the breakfast was excellent with lots of variety and plenty of everything it also was served long hours there was no onsite restaurant but there were plenty close by including a good one right next door there is a very good room service option with reasonable prices and fast delivery the food arrived piping hot so it must ve been quite near my room was larger and nicer than expected i asked for a ground floor room and that s what i got i had no view but the bottom section of the windows was stained glass it allowed in lots of light cars were parked outside people walked by and there was an office building next door the insulation from the noise was total there were roller shades outside which assured total privacy and security when lowered the air conditioning is superb the mini bar was stocked with free water soft drinks and juice and replenished as needed that was a surprise the tv had more english language stations than any other place i stayed in italy
