hotel berna is a dream fabulous efficient and friendly staff well appointed rooms and the most convenient location one can imagine both the breakfast and the aperitivo were delicioso and generous this trip was a graduation gift for my daughter and it was welcome to find a hotel that offered a room with two comfortable beds my daughter really doesn t like sharing a bed while a common option here in the states we found it rare in italy the other hotel options in this price range were far inferior from what i saw and read i would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone really a gem i read on another site that someone wrote this was a sketchy neighborhood and i beg to differ due to a train reservation glitch we arrived after midnight and walked the short distance to the hotel on our own felt completely safe it is a diverse neighborhood so if that scares you i don t know
