the property was close to the train station and the breakfast was exceptional all the positive remarks made about the sumptuous buffet breakfast were one reason i chose to stay at the hotel berna and they weren t mistaken the breakfast is indeed exceptional with enough choices to please everybody what pleased me the most is that the cappuccinos were individually made and not from a machine
