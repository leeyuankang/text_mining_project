this is an excellent city hotel one of the best we have stayed in the location to the train station and metro is minutes away and links you also by bus and tram to the rest of the city the staff are excellent and very helpful and nothing is to much bother we stayed in the annex and the room was spacious and comfortable and free soft drinks as well as a kettle for tea and coffee was a really nice touch the aperitivo with complementary snacks and food set us up each night for an evening out and the hotel recommended and made reservations for us in local restaurants excellent value highly recommended
