we were really impressed by the personalized service we received from the hotel staff the front desk even remembered our names when we stopped in a bit after check in to ask them to book us a table at a nearby restaurant the location was excellent only a few minutes away from the central rail station and there were many great restaurants and bars in the vicinity
