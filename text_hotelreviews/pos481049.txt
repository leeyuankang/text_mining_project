the staff were charming the room was freshly renovated sparkling clean quiet and had a mini bar with complimentary sodas and water breakfast was fresh and fun you could even juice your own carrots the position is excellent for getting around milan and even though it s so close to the central railway station it s very quiet we loved our stay
