we stayed in the berna tower and were a little reluctant when booking but it proved to be perfect nice room that was bigger than i first expected comfortable bed and coffee and tea facilities in the room a great plus for the free minibar and also for the possibility of personlizing the minibar and certain things in the room on the internet in advance the breakfast was very good and varied and no problem to walk the few steps just across to the main building the bathroom was a little small but not really a problem the area was safe both restaurants and cafes near by and other hotels too the best only about mins to walk to the central station where you get both the train and buses to the airport can recommend and would definitely stay there again
