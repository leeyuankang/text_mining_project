the professional and friendly service by all staff is top notch the breakfast is probably the most plentiful i have ever seen at a mid sized hotel the hotel bar happy hour is very nice and max the bartender is wonderful and gave us a great nearby restaurant suggestion our room was clean comfortable and spacious by european standards with a huge marble bathroom the hotel is very close but not too close to the central train station and walking there with rolling luggage was no problem maybe minutes very close to the metro to easily get around all of milan fantastic wi fi great value
