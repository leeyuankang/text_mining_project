the bed was huge and the room was fantastic this would have to be the best overall hotel experience we have ever had the breakfast was superb and the staff are excellent every little courtesy was provided down to hot snacks at the bar and bottles of water to help us on our way i would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to milan its also located right next the milan train station well done to everyone at hotel berna
