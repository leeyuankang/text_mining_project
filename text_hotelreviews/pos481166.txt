the location of this hotel was what drew me to it as i was arriving via train and leaving via shuttle bus it did not disappoint very convenient and felt safe the breakfast was great one morning through no fault of the hotel but rather a guest the fire alarm went off near the breakfast room the staff worked amazing quickly and well to give everyone trays to take breakfast to their rooms or relocate them and was extremely apologetic the pre stocked mini bar rubber duckie and snacks upon departure are great additions that help you feel cared for
