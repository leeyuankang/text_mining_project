this is a great value the hotel is elegant and has all the amenities of a fancy hotel but the price is reasonable the rooms are squeaky clean with super comfy beds and a gorgeous bathroom the minibar is free and there is coffee and tea in your room the breakfast is one of the best spreads i ve seen in europe did i mention that they park your car for you location is great also
