my stay at hotel berna was excellent the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable the staff was very friendly and professional what surprised me was the front desk person that checked me in remembered my name and called me by my name every time he saw me during my day stay the breakfast have plenty to choose from and was very good the main train station is approximately a five minute walk from the hotel that was very convenient when traveling to different cities within italy from milan
