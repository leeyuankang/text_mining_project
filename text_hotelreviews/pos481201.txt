this is a great hotel it is close to the train station and metro stops which was very convenient for us they provided a nice happy hour with snacks and breakfast was very good as well the shower was amazing and the room and bathroom were good sized the staff was very helpful allowing us to store our bags before check in time i would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others
