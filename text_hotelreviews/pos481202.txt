the location was great so close to central stations and restaurants nearby we were able to walk to major attractions and shops then catch a train back in the afternoon the biggest plus was the friendly helpful staff every one of them was great buffet breakfast included was good even with our food allergies there was a good variety free drinks in the room fridge was a great bonus also would definitely stay here again
