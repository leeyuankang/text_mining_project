very good breakfast friendly personnel comfy bed great wify connection clean rooms location perfectly close to train station and yet in a safe r street hop on off tourist bus also stops at the station only four stops by metro to the city center dome etc a very good catch for milano if you prefer not to be in the center but just close enough to get there in a few minutes
