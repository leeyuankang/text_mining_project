loved the rubber duck and the humour of the hotel and its staff i have no doubt that we would have loved staying there longer it was a very easy walk to the milano centrale great value for money very plentiful breakfast everything was very clean and the bed was very very comfortable the room was quiet and well appointed as was the bathroom highly recommend this hotel
