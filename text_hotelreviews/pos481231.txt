manuel at the front desk was able to get us into our room early which was most appreciated after a long overnight flight the room was immaculate the bed was super comfortable and all the amenities requested ahead of time were already there the breakfast was amazing as was the service in the dining area perfect for our needs since it was very close to the train station i would highly recommend it and would love to come back again and stay longer
