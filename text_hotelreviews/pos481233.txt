from the moment we walked into this hotel until we return again and that is a promise because our experience was out from the friendly and informative staff to the beautiful person who prepared our room and greeted us we felt like we came home rather than staying at s hotel just minutes walk from the station good restaurants close by and a very good supermarket close by it is an ideal location and high quality hotel breakfast has a wide range of food to eat and we would give it for food quality
