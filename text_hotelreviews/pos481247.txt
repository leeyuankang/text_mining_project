great value for money only stayed one night after getting in late from of flying hotel berna was exactly what we needed it has an old school charm with impeccable service which made you feel right at home they also let you customize your pillows etc which was a nice touch and a free minibar breakfast was also good value we felt for euros and the location is unbeatable
