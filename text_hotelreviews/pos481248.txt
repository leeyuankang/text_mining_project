i ve stayed in this hotel just for overnight checked in around and had to check out no later than am so my expectations weren t high while creating my reservation but my experience was even way more that what i d expect for a long stay i ve have been greeted with a nice smile and a warm welcome i ve been given a room update next thing which was looking better and bigger than what i ve seen on reservation free of charge things placed within the room were really kind and was a nice jesture finally although the room had something being forgotton before my stay i ve been informed that i ve forgotton something in the room which increased my trust to the hotel now i know if next time i stay there and forget something i would be informed by the hotel next time i come to milano now i know where i ll be staying
