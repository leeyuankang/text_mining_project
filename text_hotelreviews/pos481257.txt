on this my third visit to hotel berna i was given a beautifully appointed room in the tower annexe with lots of little luxury items such as bathrobes welcome sweeties and even a free takeaway bath duck the staff were extremely polite welcoming and helpful with queries the whole hotel exudes a quiet and efficient charm and warmth that makes you feel instantly at home
