everything was wonderful but especially the staff i had forgotten my ipad charger and stephano offered to bring in his from home unbelievable all staff at the front desk were professional friendly and knowledgable as were the other staff members everyone went out of their way to address any needs or wants and always with a smile i d like to compliment maria who prepared aperitivo every evening delightful person who made us feel quite special even preparing an individual serving of tiramisu i d definitely recommend the berna to friends
