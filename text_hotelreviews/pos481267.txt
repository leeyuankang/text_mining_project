i appreciated particularly the possibility to choose the type of bedding i hate duvets especially in hotels which i so often find over heated it was nice to have a sheet and blanket we had a quiet room as requested the breakfast was excellent the hotel is very well located if you arrive by train and you can be in the centre of town in minutes by metro
