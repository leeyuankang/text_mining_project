we got free upgrade to superior room which was great the room was clean and stylish and it provided everything we need including slippers and free minibar i love the fact that we could customise our room using the hotel s website before we arrive the breakfast was exceptional with large variety of food and drinks i believe you cannot find breakfast in such a high quality in most of the hotels b bs in italy this was the best breakfast and indeed the best hotel we stayed in the whole trip the staff were very polite and attentive as well i would highly recommend this hotel to everyone
