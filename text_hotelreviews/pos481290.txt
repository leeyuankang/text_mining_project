what can i say if i were to go back to milan i would definitely stay here again we were greeted by very friendly and welcoming staff members then we were given a free upgrade the gentleman at the bar was very friendly he recommended a restaurant for us which was also lovely the room was clean and tidy and within walking distance from the train station
