very well located for the central station just a couple of hundred meters walk so very easy to get to from the airport getting to the main tourist sites like the duomo di milano or sforza castle is about a minute walk or a brief trip on the metro staff were excellent particularly on the front desk room was recently modernised and comfortable and overall it was good value
