the location is very convenient close to the train station and metro that brings you to duomo in min but what was really impressive is an attention to details nice personal message in the room free bar of non alcoholic drinks tea coffee in the room with tasty pastries and even a chocolate bar there is also a cosy sitting area behind the reception with a coffee machine and water wifi connection was perfect in the room it was also very convenient to buy metro tickets at the reception desk no lines no crowds i took breakfast only once since it was not included in my reservation and it was very good lots of choices and excellent service
