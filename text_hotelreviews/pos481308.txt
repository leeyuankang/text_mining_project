very convenient location i arrived at milan centrale station and had no trouble finding the hotel which is literally just min walk away the metro station is also right there you can go to all the sights easily the breakfast is also very delicious and staff is very friendly i booked a single annex but the staff saw i was a girl traveling alone he immediately upgraded my room to a large double room without charging extra
