stayed at the hotel while visiting the eicma motorcycle show great staff perfect location for public transport into milan and to the motorcycle show the dues ex machina cafe is just two stops away and well worth a visit if you loved motorbikes or surfing the hotel is just a short taxi ride to and from the airport which cost the hotels puts on a continental breakfast which is second to none cant fault the hotel at all next visit to milan and this will be my first choice of hotel
