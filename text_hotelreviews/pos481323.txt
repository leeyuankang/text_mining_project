this is great hotel largely due to the fantastic staff handy position and generously stocked rooms and copious food options at breakfast we were supplied with a breakfast box at am as we had to catch the train to paris at am that is what i call service the hotel is a little old fashioned in some ways although the wf works a treat but it is so so comfortable
