we stayed only one night at this hotel but is was very nice the rooms are comfortable with everything you possibly need including wifi our room was very quiet because it faced the courtyard the location is excellent especially you arrive or depart by a train but even if you use other means of transportation the metro is very close as well the area around hotel is safe even though it s very close to the central train station and breakfast is absolutely superb
