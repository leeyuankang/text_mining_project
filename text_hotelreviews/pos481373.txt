location from train station was on the top of our list we were tired and hot on the first attempt but after that we were like locals in successfully walking back and forth the front desk staff aided us with locating the late delivery person of our lascalla tix and we even met a couple in the hotel bar to share a taxi to the performance the breakfasts each morning were soooo delicious and beautifully presented the room modern and great shower and free mini bar
