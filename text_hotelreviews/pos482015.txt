we were looking for a hotel for the weekend in milan that wouldn t break the bank to do this you have to sacrifice location for cost but fortunately the hotel is located across the street from the main train station which is only a few stops from the duomo and we also got the added benefit of learning how to traverse the city via metro very easy actually breakfast was nice as well rooms were small but comfortable
