we spent nights in this hotel we booked a family room for persons excellent location minutes from the malpensa bus station direct access to metro lines stores and restaurants nearby very kind and helpful staff they offered an early check in at a m which was extremely convenient due to our early flight very useful recommendations on nearby restaurants city highlights and opening hours breakfast room small and therefore a bit crowded but overall practical and clean good choice of cold and warm dishes the rooms are a bit outdated but clean and the size was convenient i would definitely come back again
