very convenient location for those travelling by train less than minutes leisurely walk from the milano centrale station helpful staff right through from reception to the waiters julie enjoyed the lovely porccini soup at breakfast and expressed her appreciation to the waiter rushini and asked whether or when it will be on the menu again unfortunately it would not be on the menu till after our departure however rushini promised her a bowl of chicken soup for the next morning s breakfast which he said was just as tasty it was duly delivered how good is that for service thanks rushini staff at reception helped us with maps and gave us information on transportation to various sites in milan even sold us day tickets so we didn t have to queue at the various stations good choice of breakfast menu champagne and mimosa were included what more do you want
