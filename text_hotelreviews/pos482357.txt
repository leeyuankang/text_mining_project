we had an awesome experience at this hotel the room was very nice with modern furniture and a really big and comfy bed everything was clean they changed the towels everyday and was happy to see that we even had a hair dryer in the bathroom the temperature was perfect in the room as the heating was turned on which was unexpected but a big plus for this considering that we went there in april the hotel it s really close to the metro station so minute max of walking the breakfast was excellent you can chose from a variety of foods omelette cereals jam butter cheese yogurt salads fruits pastry and coffee of your own choice juices water all in all i would not hesitate to come back here
