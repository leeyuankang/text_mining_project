we stayed at this hotel for nights and we can say the hotel is not very far from the city center in the room there is a flat tv minibar and also a safe the room is clean but the furniture is old and there is a smell in the room i think from the bathroom in the bathroom there is a bidet and hairdryer all in all if you visit milan for sightseeing and you don t spend the whole trip in the room this hotel could be taken into account since it has a good price ratio
