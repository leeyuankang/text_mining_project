i have returned to the park grand lancaster gate around or times now i believe it will always be my number choice in london now the staff are great really helpful they are accommodating to your needs from the moment you arrive until you leave it is just a very tightly run ship that prides itself on customer satisfaction location is fantastic i love that part of london shops restaurants transport and easily in town in a few moments the rooms are great elemis toiletries are a lovely touch my club twin is such a good size i honestly would find it hard to pin point a negative great stay cannot wait to stay again
