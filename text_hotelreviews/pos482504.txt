the drive from the train station to our accommodation was not far would have been a good hour s drive if we had travelled from the airport nice smallish hotel in a reasonable location we walked to the milan cathedral from our hotel and it didn t take that long approximately minutes staff at the hotel helped with directions which was very much appreciated the hotel didn t have a restaurant so we dined out couple of recommendations from staff again ate in an absolutely fabulous gourmet pizza place minutes walk from our accommodation the best and i mean very best pizza we have ever eaten we have eaten pizza all over the world and definitely couldn t beat this one room clean not big but after a bit of rearranging we could accommodate our suitcases and move around still breakfast reasonable but there is a charge of euro s per person the hotel staff helped us with route decisions when we doing the hop on off bus this saved us a lot of time if you are in milan and a bit of a foodie you should go to peck an up market food place which is a bit like your harrod s david jones food courts not far from the cathedral about a minute walk all in all our short stay in milan was lovely
