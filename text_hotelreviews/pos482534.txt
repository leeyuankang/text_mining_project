the location was ideal as it was just outside city centre which could be easily reached by foot or else the tram which was just up the block the bed was gorgeous the room spacious and the bathroom and shower were high tech the ac was nice for the hot summer nights of our stay and there was an amazing restaurant across the street for an authentic italian meal close by as well as a grocery for drinks and snacks
