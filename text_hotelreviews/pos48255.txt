i was made to feel very welcome from the moment i arrived the room was great spotlessly clean and very comfortable i didn t use it but thought the microwave was a valuable addition never stayed anywhere that provides a free mobile phone for use inside and out of the hotel so useful breakfast was lovely only tried the continental everything was very fresh and a wonderful selection
