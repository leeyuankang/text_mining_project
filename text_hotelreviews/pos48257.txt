the hotel staff were amazing attentive and very friendly we were greated with warm flannels and a glass of fresh juice while we registered knowing this was a special occasion they had prepared our room with rose petals scattered across the bed a complimentary bottle of wine and a plate of strawberries dipped in chocolate there was also a handwritten card welcoming us the bed was very comfortable the room clean and reasonably quiet we will hopefully return we have many special memories from our stay the hotel is just over five minutes on foot from padington underground station i would also highly recommended the flavours of india just a few minutes walk away it doesn t look like much but the food is stunning also we eat breakfast at the farmacy minutes from the hotel where you can celebrity watch and have a delightful dairy free meal
