we have already visited many hotels but i must admit this one was one of the best ones we booked junior suite and it turned to be perfect for us looked exactly same as on pictures it was also only min by metro to the center so again very convenient people at the reception were really helpful and always answered our questions and requests if we are coming back to milan we will definitely return to this hotel
