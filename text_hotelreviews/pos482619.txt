just few steps from the metro station porta di mare on line which goes directly to the central square duomo as well as to the central rail station although it s pretty far from all places to visit and the downtown with the metro connection it s really just minutes to reach moreover milano being with tight streets and no parking space at all it s better to go around the city by metro instead of car rent a car large rooms a lot of elevators kind staff at the reception although everything looks a bit used it is well maintained and clean
