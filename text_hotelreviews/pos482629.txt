the room was spacious clean and quiet the staff was courteous and helpful good quality of mattress and nice choice of products for the minibar appreciated also the small boiler for coffee and tea the breakfast had good quality and enough variety i also liked the location which was appropriate for our needs although there is nothing around to do in the neighbourhood with metro station just around the corner and easy access to the peripheral road of milan its easy to go anywhere you want
