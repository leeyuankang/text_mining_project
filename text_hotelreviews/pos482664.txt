we booked a simple room for one night and we received a free upgrade to a suite the room was awesome everything was clean quiet warm and cosy the bed was so comfortable first time we slept so well the breakfast was delicious the staff kind and helpful the metro station is just a few steps away don t think twice it s the best choice
