the starhotels business palace does well its job it s a very decent hotel in a slightly decentralized area of milan it s very well connected to the city centre via the underground minutes to duomo door to door which is really good staff is extremely friendly and helpful from reception to breakfast room from bar personnel to room cleaning which is very appreciated i ve even asked for a late check out which was nicely granted room was spacious and clean had while not particularly charming it had everything needed for a good stay it s a business hotel as the name of the hotel also suggests which means you are not going to find an intimate or romantic atmosphere but given the fair price i paid euro night for a superior room it can be a good choice if you are in leisure time visiting the city
