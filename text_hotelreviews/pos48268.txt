first of all every single person in the hotel s staff was incredibly kind they really made me feel at ease during my stay plus they helped me solve a problem with my boarding pass in five seconds flat room is very very quiet comfortable and spacious enough for one person there is a huge shower box in the bathroom and a lot of useful items scattered around the room such as a hairdryer iron and ironing board usb and hdmi plugs and squeaky clean kettle and microwave oven i also appreciated the handy device you can carry with you this way you can roam about without a thought to your own smartphone suddenly parting ways with bt fon wifi and google maps vanishing right when you re walking somewhere new cleanliness is obviously paramount and the whole place smells divine from the room to the corridors to the main hall
