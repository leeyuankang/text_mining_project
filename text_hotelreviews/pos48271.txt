the staff here were fabulous we had requested to check in early and you had a room available for us two hours before our actual check in time the staff were so lovely kind and genuine we felt so welcomed into the hotel the heated towels and welcome drinks were a fabulous gesture which we had never had before in any other hotel we loved how the room would be cleaned up with fresh sheets and towels when returning after a long day sight seeing the swans made out of the towels were just fabulous this hotel is now highly recommended and i will definitely be returning thank you for a lovely stay
