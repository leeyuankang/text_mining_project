we upgraded to a junior suite for a really reasonable price and it was absolutely worth it the interior was great the room was extremely clean the staff was very professional and very friendly the rooms are big and the service was great the hotel is very central it is just a smidgen away from a subway station that directly goes to the main destinations like dome and central railway station
