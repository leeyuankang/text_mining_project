the staff are wonderful customer service was fantastic this is a small hotel and the rooms are small yet every inch of space has been used creatively making for a very comfortable stay the location is wonderful and great value for money but what really made the difference was the amazing friendly staff my birthday was made so special and i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough i will be back
