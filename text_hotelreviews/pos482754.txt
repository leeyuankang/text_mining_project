on the other hand we got a spacious two rooms apartment on the floor for people its windows went to three sides and all the views were very nice actually i don t care about tv sets in the hotels but i just mention for those who do that each room had a modern flat screen tv the breakfast was diverse enough but actually the same every day that s ok for two three days but can be annoying for a longer stay having a metro station next to the hotel was also good the barmen was nice to lend us wine glasses and to open our bottle
