the staff were very friendly and welcoming and provided good information about transport to major attractions the hotel is bright and clean but just the same as other hotels of the same level nothing about the decor or facilities really stands out as exceptional the room was large as was the bathroom and the bed was very large and comfortable whilst the hotel is close to a metro stop it is a long way from the centre of milan we had a minute transfer by bus from malpensa to central train station and then another minute taxi drive to the hotel it was min by metro to il duomo
