everything was great we were not expecting to have such high quality and service for that price the rooms are just as they are shown maybe even better great location very close to the metro and also it is possible to walk around the staff is very helpful we needed our shuttle tickets to be printed and they did it in the middle of the night really fast room was cleaned every day we are very very happy about our stay here absolutely recommend it
