the staff was incredibly nice and helpful the hotel location is great i am vegan so i was scared that there were not going to be many options for me at breakfast but they were waiting for me with vegan croissants which was a very nice touch the bed is very confortable the shower is small but has a nice water pressure the rooms are wide clean and have everything you could need for your stay even a minibar and a boiler
