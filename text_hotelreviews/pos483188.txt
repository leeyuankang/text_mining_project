the location next to a metro station and less than half an hour from the city center the breakfast was rich i enjoyed the cakes and croissants the room was very clean and the bed very comfortable the personel was very polite especially roberto who accepted my request for a water boiler and the sicilian lady at the reception who helped me with a difficulty i had with the initial wifi connection the area was very quiet and safe overall a pleasant stay and definetely a choice i would return if i were to visit milano again
