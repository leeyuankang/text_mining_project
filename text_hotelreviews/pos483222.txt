very nice place to stay perfect distance to walk to mico congress min and right off of corso sempione leading right into domo a good walk but i did it several times in visiting cafes and sights to see the breakfast buffet is the best i have had in italy many choices of things to eat my favorite was the mixed fruit the subway was min away where i could travel to central station the front desk was helpful and professional i would definitely stay again
