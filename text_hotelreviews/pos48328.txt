everything was superb at this hotel loved the friendly and helpful staff especially franklin who went above and beyond helping us with one of our tour glitches i loved that the staff anticipated our needs before we were able to voice them they were always ready and eager to help we were greeted every time we entered the lobby doors held open water given if we were hot from a day of walking and they sent requested items up to the rooms quickly the staff is what makes this hotel wonderful the rooms were clean and comfortable breakfast was wonderful and hearty
