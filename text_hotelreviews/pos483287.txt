the attention to detail from every staff member was in our opinion unparalleled with most other hotels yes it s expensive though worth every penny we were in our element in milan due to the location we will now stay there every time we are in italy they even recommended the most amazing restaurant for our last night best meal of the whole day trip in europe i m now a number one fan of this bulgari group
