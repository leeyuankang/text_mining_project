the staff were very welcoming and helpful i was surprised at how large the room was and particularly the walk in closet i even wondered if they had given us a last minute upgrade generally i look for relatively low cost hotels that have decent reviews and a good location so i m not rating this against a high end hotel experience but for a traveler who wasn t expecting luxury this made me feel a little bit pampered on the last two days of the trip
