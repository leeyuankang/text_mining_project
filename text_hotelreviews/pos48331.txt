i loved this hotel the staff is extremely nice and helpful they also had a service called handy which allowed you to use the cellphone to access the cellular data for maps or searching online without being connected to wifi this tool was absolutely amazing and really helpful in navigating the city i was able to quickly google map my route instead of pulling out a hard copy of the map to figure out how to get from point a to point b the rooms are small which is to be expected in europe the beds were super comfortable the hotel is also in a great location just a short walk to the central line which is what i used most frequently during my stay i would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to london
