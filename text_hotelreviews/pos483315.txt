so disappointed with this hotel the first time checking in the staff older man was overall rude and talked down to me and my friend i tried to ignore this so it did not spoil my holiday the next day he was still very rude to us later that night we came back from our tour and saw another staff member at the desk and felt safe to ask him a question about the wifi connection his name is stefano and he was courteous and answered all our questions in a professional manner the breakfast had icy cold scramble eggs in the buffet when another guest pointed it out to a staff member he open the bottom cabinet and flip some switches supposed to warm up the eggs in its silver pan pros the coffee and croissant was fresh the property is nicely decorated comfy bed and pillows
