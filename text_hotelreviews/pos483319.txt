we ate at the hotel since neighborhood restaurants were few breakfast at the hotel was excellent lots of delicious choices dinner varied from fair to excellent marco s service was excellent the hotel is just blocks from the central train station using a day metro ticket we were able to get anywhere we wanted to fairly easily we packed a lot of sightseeing into our days knowing that dinner would be available at the hotel when we got back the staff were mostly exceptional we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future
