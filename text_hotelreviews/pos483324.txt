the location is excellent near the train station metro trams buses the room and sheets were clean as well as the bathroom although there was a funny smell in the bathroom on the second day of our stay the breakfast was very good for only euro per person from scrambled eggs to croissants fruit tarts we enjoyed it every morning although after a few days you might get bored with it
