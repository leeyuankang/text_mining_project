like every best western rooms were spacious comfortable hotel is just next to central station which is great if you need to take an early train but otherwise not the nicest neighborhood of milan to stay in quality is ok but quite costly more than for night without breakfast we stayed here for our last night in milan and this was the most expensive stay of our entire italy trip and quality of the other hotels was comparable the service was however impeccable
