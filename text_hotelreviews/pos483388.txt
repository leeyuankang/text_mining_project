you never know what you are going to get with a best western but we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel it is only minutes walk from the main train station it dosn t look like much from the outside but inside it was very nice the reception staff were exceptionally warm and friendly they kept giving my young daughters sweets when we left my youngest gave one of them a hug which was very touching the room was very large and well equipped the breakfast was also excellent i thought it was very reasonably priced for the centre of milan we would recommend staying here if you are visiting milan
