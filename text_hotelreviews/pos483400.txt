very convenient location right next to central station we were given a suite on the ground floor which was surprisingly big and comfy the windows had electric shutters that made it even better we even had an exercise bike available in the room we had arrived late after midnight and since we were only staying for one night we asked for late checkout and they were more than happy to assist us with our request value for money especially in milan would stay here again
