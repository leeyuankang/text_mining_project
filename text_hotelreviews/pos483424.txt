i only spent night here after flying into milan from australia i booked this hotel as it is conveniently located near milano centrale the staff were friendly and attentive the room was clean large for an italian hotel the bed was comfortable and there was satellite tv the breakfast was good as and what you would expect at a hotel chain the wifi was reliable in my view it was value for money
