the staff were very customer friendly and customer orientated nothing was too much trouble and they even opened the door for you gave a hand with luggage and showed you to your room even had little touches like chocolates on the bed of a night time and a mini fridge with a pricing list all mod cons and a free wifi phone which was easy to use definitely stay again
