the staff was very helpful accommodating and remembered our breakfast order and brought my private super food seeds that i had left with them when i arrived to my table every morning the linen was always clean and the bed very comfortable the complimentary water tea and biscuit selection in the room was very welcome the handy travel guide is a nifty addition to the room although we never made use of it close to paddington station and lancaster gate tube station convenience stores nearby
