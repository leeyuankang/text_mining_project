the location is very nice minute walk from hyde park lancaster gate tube station paddington tube station minute by bus train to oxford street hotel was very nice it s not extravagant or luxurious but more like an excellent boutique hotel rooms are a bit small but then thats the case everywhere it is complete value for money
