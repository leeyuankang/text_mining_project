the breakfast had a choice of bread cakes croissants cereal bacon sausages egg ham cheese juices coffee hot chocolate tea fruit although the watermelon looked like it had been there for the duration of the stay as in staff didnt change it but thats assumption from its appearance the free shuttle service takes minutes to get to the train station where you can then explore milan without the shuttle i would ve labelled the location lower as there is not much around as getting anywhere from the hotel is quite expensive so grateful for the free shuttle the front desk staff were helpful although one was a little frustrated by the time we needed to change rooms from the third time onwards i thought it was quite cheap for star but you get what you pay for
