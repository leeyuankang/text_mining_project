it was walking distance to the milan expo about minutes the shuttle bus service was useful for certosa train station enabling one to spend the day in milan we much prefer smaller hotels but we needed a convenient location to this area and the hub fit the bill the staff were all very friendly and helpful throughout our stay the dinner in the restaurant was very good now that the expo is over it is probably good for a couple days if you have business in the area or want a hotel near the motorway
