the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly and made our stay much nicer than it otherwise might have been in that they offered more warmth and attention to our needs than one expects in such a big city the rooms bathrooms are rather small as it often the case in london but the rooms were extremely clean and well appointed firm mattress crisp sheets fluffy towels lofty bedding pillows exceeded our expectations
