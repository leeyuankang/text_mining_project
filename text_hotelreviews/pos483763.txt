hotel is very comfortable the staff are friendly the food is good we stayed on sunday and the restaurant was closed but there is a good room service menu the food was of good quality and nicely served there is secure parking on site and the hotel is very easy to find from the motorway it is aimed mainly at business users but is also a very good place for a stopover if like us you are travelling to italy
