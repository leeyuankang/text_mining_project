the staff were variable at checkin the desk manager could see i was struggling to get my suitcases up the front steps only about four from memory but it included holding a door open but he chose to ignore it when i finally made the desk i remarked that it was difficult but he also chose to ignore that remark conversely another manager couldn t have been more helpful and was very pleasant breakfast was good and there is a pleasant outside area where one can sit for breakfast or at other times there was easy access to the train station about minutes walk
