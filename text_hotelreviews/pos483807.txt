was a day refreshment weekend to get away from work stress keep it in mind haven t stayed long well central location you can t deny that but to be honest everywhere is central if you have a metro nearby the staff was ok didn t need to have much interaction also didn t have time to check gym but it was open till which seems to be a positive thing even though i dont know who would go gym in a tourism city after walking km day wi fi functioned without a problem
