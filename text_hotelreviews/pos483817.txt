close to milan centrale helpful and friendly staff i booked late but asked for a quiet room and they allocated me a double at the back of the building which was perfect and extremely comfortable the bed was so heavenly i didn t want to leave it the next morning very good breakfast served in an attractive dining area with an outside garden terrace it s not cheap but you get what you pay for
