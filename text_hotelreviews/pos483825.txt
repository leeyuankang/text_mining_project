easy access to metro wifi all around the hotel nice staff in particular the lady working at the breakfast who recognized my need for double expresso after one day good breakfast selection within minutes walk from mama rosa and antro della sibilla restaurants nice to know in case you are tired of the city and looking for good food felt safe to walk alone in the area
