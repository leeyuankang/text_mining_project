if you are travelling to milan this is the place to stay a comfortable and affordable star hotel just a one minute walk to the subway and a minute walk to one of the main shopping districts marghera they are dog friendly and they provide parking so you can leave your car and visit milan on foot the immediate area offers small shops and street food breakfast at the hotel was wonderful a full buffet with flaky croissants excellent selection of coldcuts and cheese and scrambled eggs and bacon very highly recommend the antares rubens for anyone visiting milan
