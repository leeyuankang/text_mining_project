we went for a san siro event so it was very handy to walk to and from the venue and not bother driving or taking the public transport through the crowd the rooms are a charming century kitsch with a super hi tec bathroom where it takes time to figure out how to turn on the tap and it s very clean comfortable and spacy the breakfast is served at the rooftop glass covered terace most lovely although i would have prefered some open space to have a smoke with my morning coffee the staff were all most charming as usual overly clumsily polite and most helpful
