they were very accommodating to our three dogs and no extra pet fees the breakfast is very good but go early because they don t seem too concerned with replenishing the food after the renovated rooms were very comfortable and modern the new showers are great the park right next to the hotel was super convenient for the dogs wifi worked well in the rooms
