it was really close to the duomo literally just around the corner for those that like to shop there is a huge shopping center right outside the hotel too lots of restaurants nearby some are really good the duomo museum is just across the square too for those that like the bar scene there is a bar on the bottom floor that seemed popular the place is modern i would call it bizarre there is no door knob on the outside of the door the bathroom door disappears into the wall the bed can roll across the floor the shower has no door there is no counter at the bathroom sink the sink is tiny making water go all over there is no place to hang a towel near the sink or near the shower you can hang towels on the bathroom door if you want to drip across the bathroom to get to it you can hang a towel over the bidet there are usb ports at the head of the bed to charge with delivering amp for larger devices there is a huge piece of art sitting on the floor at the end of the bed just waiting for your toe to stub seating is a small cube or a medium cube there are additional outlets around the room the lighting is odd too lights around the edge under the shelf reading lights hallway and bathroom with switches in various places finding them all is a challenge
