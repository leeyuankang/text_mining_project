the location is the best being in the heart of the shopping and a stones throw from the duomo great restaurants close by train station and cab rank about a minute walk to see the last supper straf bar is a great place just to sit and watch the locals and tourists walk by with an aperol spritzer in your hand staff were delightful and extremely helpful
