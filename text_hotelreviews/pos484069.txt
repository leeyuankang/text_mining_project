i have never stayed in a hotel that is as perfectly located as the hotel straf it is a second walk away from the duomo and main shopping district so easy to pop back to the hotel to put your bags down or charge your phone it also is positioned down a quiet side road so the entrance does not have any cars or a lot of tourists outside i think the room was a perfect size and not too small at all as some of these reviews say i loved the bathroom area and look of the room is really dark and i m normally someone who prefers everything to be light but i feel the darkness really aided my sleep and i felt very well rested when leaving milan staff were really friendly and helpful when i had an issue gaining access into my room cleaner on that floor at the time helped waiter in breakfast room was very pleasant and accommodating as were the waiters in the bar i had forgotten a european adaptor toothbrush and umbrella all of which they let me borrow free of charge when i checked in females on the desk could have been better and a bit speedier but male on desk at check out was excellent this is when i asked where i could purchase an umbrella as it was torrential rain outside and he gave me one really great customer service would return and recommend to colleagues
