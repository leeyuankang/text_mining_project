we booked a triple room there wasn t much space but overall ok the fastest room service ever all time early mornings or late nights i was really shocked and loved how fast i m getting my requests done amazing location helpful staff even if u ask for an outsourced service they helped me with planning trips and airport transportation even when it was done by another party
