very cozy boutique style hotel located min walk from la scala very spacious rooms and comfortable beds the street where the hotel sits is very small and with no traffic so is calm and nothing bothers your sleep it felt more like home than a typical hotel environment the staff were super friendly and helpful i would definitely come back and next time star in one of the rooms with private terrace out of for me
