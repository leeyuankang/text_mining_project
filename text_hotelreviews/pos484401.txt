i really loved this place and would stay there again on my next trip to milan the location couldn t have been better central and close to everything and yet the street was really quiet i also loved the modern decor inside a very old building the staff spoke excellent english and were very helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations the room was spacious enough to fit the three of us comfortably and the linens and pillows were super comfy
