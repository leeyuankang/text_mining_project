stuff very helpful with everything nice breakfast with a nice view lots of flowers everywhere very large rooms working air coditioning it s a very small hotel so you don t need to give you room number or anything as the stuff knows you from the first day so very convinient in many cases hotel is meters from duomo and meters from via dante so cannot have any better location
