this hotel generally gets positive ratings and you can see why the location is excellent the hotel is on a quiet street just off the main shopping area near to a couple of metro stations the staff are fantastic and the place is spotless we had one of the terrace rooms the slightly larger one on the roof and there is no doubt it is a beautiful room it is light and spacious and the little garden is lovely it was general quiet except for the garbage pickup one morning
