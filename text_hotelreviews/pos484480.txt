a modern minimalistic oasis with the centre of milan at your doorstep my room was spacious simple in design no unnecessary clutter with window that opened to let in fresh air the bustling sounds of the city bathroom a good size staff were helpful engaging breakfast typically boutique but more than adequate overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience
