step out of the hotel take a few steps towards via dante and you re immediately engulged by milano s tourist crowd it s a great location especially if you re here to visit the expo milano cairoli station is just a three minute walk away from the hotel and you re at the expo in about minutes for you can find everything you need around the hotel and if you re the kind that likes to shop there s plenty to keep you occupied the hotel values form over function so if you re traveling for business and need a desk or table to place your laptop to work from well chances are you might not get that at least not in the single room i booked a quiet room and even though i didn t hear any of the hustle and bustle from the hallway and stairs the room i got faced two small side streets and that was fairly busy so make sure you close the windows for some peace and quiet breakfast at the hotel is a basic affair true to its general theme you can get bread cheese croissants and meat but you ll have to order the eggs seperately if you want them staff were friendly and very helpful you even get six free international phone calls from your room if you think you need the service this was very useful to me as roaming on my phone took two days to get activated so i definitely made use of this service you can t dial local italian phone numbers though go figure i would definitely stay here again
