this is the best hotel i have ever stayed in great suite lovely staff and near to the main attractions in particular i was impressed with how the manager dealt with a very obnoxious man complaining about a triviality when he was dealing with three other clients he would have been justified in telling the incredibly rude man to foxtroct oscor instead he dealt with the situation with great decorum and professionalism next time we go to the opera we will be staying here
