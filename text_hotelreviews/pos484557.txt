comfortable beds and a maginificent patterned parquet floor made the room appealing even though there was no view the reception was enthusiastic and welcoming and couldn t have been more helpful and lovely except i had prepaid for breakfast for two and unfortunately i had not calculated that i would have to leave for the airport before breakfast had begun i wish they had been willing to offer a refund or some kind of compensation like a piece of fruit and coffee
