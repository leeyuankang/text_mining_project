this is a gorgeous small hotel beautifully decorated in italianate style with a bit of modern mixed in amazing rooftop lounge with a panoramic view of the duomo and all milan i loved our stay here the staff was extremely accommodating with everything it is located off a tiny street in the historic center which also makes it quiet at night
