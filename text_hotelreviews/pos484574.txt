it was our first time in milano and we chose the santa maria suites due to it s central location the welcome was very friendly thanks to the staff who were all very helpful they all spoke very goog english our room was spacious and clean only the air conditioner was a little insufficient as it was very hot the highlight though was the rooftop terrace and it s view overlooking the surrounding area and the milano duomo we didn t bother to look for a restaurant in the evening but chose to stay home in our hotel and were served very good dinners both evenings on the terrace but beware although you are in the middle of a city nature strikes an about p m when little flies invaded and stung but with a good anti mosquito spray bring your own the problem was solved easily when we will visit milano again we will surely come back
