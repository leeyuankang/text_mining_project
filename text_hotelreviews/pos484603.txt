the staff were friendly informative and thoughtful in particular marco maritza and lucca really helped us feel welcome and appreciated we were grateful that they could speak english we enjoyed the small boutique size of the property along with its rooftop terrace which offered beautiful city views location was excellent in the heart of the city center but discretely tucked away in a quiet location
