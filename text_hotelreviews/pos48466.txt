the hotel was wonderful i arrived at and they worked to get my room ready immediately after seeing i was traveling from the night before the room was lovely small but i expected that i had more than enough room to move around and space for my belongings it was clean bed was good shower was small but had a both handheld and overhead faucets i appreciated the refrigerator and the safe and the ample outlets there was a u s one which i wish i knew ahead of time there was turndown service with chocolates and apples at the door while i never used the breakfast the restaurant was always full and the afternoon tea looked lovely would definitely stay again close to both paddington and lancaster gate tube stations
