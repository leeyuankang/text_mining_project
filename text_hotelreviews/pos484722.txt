location was perfect the appartment was very spacious and our two little children slept in a separate room on the sofa bed the masterbed was good and the airconditioning worked really good too i can recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in milano centro we parked the car in the meda parking which was only a few minutes walking to the hotel
