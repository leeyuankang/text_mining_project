this is a very nice and comfortable hotel in the center of milan walking distance from piazza duomo and in a very nice location there are plenty of parking opportunities nearby and the hotel has a good rate with the closest car park there we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely the hotel has been recently refurbished it is nice and very comfortable
