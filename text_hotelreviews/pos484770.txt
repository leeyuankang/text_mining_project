nice city location walking distance to doumo and shopping district the staff were very helpful and courteous its nice to walk into a hotel and made to feel comfortable breakfast choice was limited for vegetarians however the restaurant manager arranged to make egg for me on both mornings to cater for my requirement the rooms were comfortable the bathroom was nice with modern facility hotel was definitely star standard
