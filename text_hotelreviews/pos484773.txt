the hotel itself is amazing very new and modern with great facilities we had a suite with a nice view of the duomo very nicely decorated and extremely cozy i would say pretty luxurious loved the smell in the hotel and the rooms simply beautiful the staff was nice the breakfast was incredible for an italian hotel very rich and fresh recommended
