if anything was worth paying for in my life it was this hotel i don t know where to start the welcome the perfect breakfast clean and ultra modern rooms the staff especially the reception i don t know his name but he said he was from africa it felt like a star hotel i reccomend walking to duomo mins and to other parts go to crocetta metro station only mins away milano is expensive so you will definetely leave a lot of money on accomodation but make sure its in this hotel
