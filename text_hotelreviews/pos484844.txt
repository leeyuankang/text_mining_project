the staff were excellent very helpful we were originally meant to travel a week earlier they changed our booking with no charges without any problem breakfast was very good great variety and if there something else you wanted they were happy to get it for you location was very good min walk to the duomo we had a suite as we were celebrating a special event and the suite views were lovely
