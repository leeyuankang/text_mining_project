the staff were friendly and helpful we got given an upgrade on arrival which we appreciated greatly and enjoyed since we have been in and out of hotels in different countries for the past and a weeks we were only there night but the room was spacious and very comfortable with plenty of luxury bathroom items and we even received a knock on the door only to be given some little chocolates after we settled in suitcases taken to our room for us enjoyed our stay
