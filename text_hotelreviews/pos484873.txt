great central location close to lots of restaurants and shopping good decoration throughout most of the front of house staff are friendly and helpful some no so but wasn t sure if that was a language issue more than attitude towards helping the restaurant lacked atmosphere as just us eating but the food served was really good breakfast choice was good with enough options to suit everyones taste
