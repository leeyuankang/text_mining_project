a lovely modern hotel in a good location only minutes walk from the duomo and the shopping area rooms although not over large they never are in italy had plenty of space to move about the room the beds were comfortable and the large tv was in a position on the wall at the end of the bed that made it easy to watch with out straining a neck muscle there was tea and coffee in the room as well as a mini bar a great full legnth mirror good mirrors and lighting in the bathroom the water pressure was good in the shower every thing was nice and clean there was a hairdrier i would have liked and iron and iroing board but a quick call down to reception and i had one delivered with in minutes there is a bar area which is comfortable enough to stay for a drink and not just a meeting area the buffet breakfast was good with a wide choice of hot and cold food the staff could not have been more helpful from the moment we stepped out from our taxi on arrival to when we departed the hotel we asked for a recommendation for a resturant in a particular district of milan the reception gave us a resturant that was tucked in the back streets we would never have come across left to our own devices it was perfect the food and the service spot on the hotel reception phoned ahead booked our tables and organised taxis to take us there i would use this hotel if i return to milan and would recommend it to others
