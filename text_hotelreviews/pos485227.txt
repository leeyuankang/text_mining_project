we had two rooms one classic double and one junior suite we loved the classy soft furnishing of the room the marble bathroom was spacious and clean the air conditioning worked really well for the hot and humid weather in july the classic double is a bit small in size nonetheless it has a big and really comfortable bed a well sized wardrobe armchairs coffee table etc our three adult children had the junior suite it was roomy for three persons the bedroom was very spacious and one felt really comfortable to be in they had no problems to spread out their suitcases and shopping the bathroom was big with marble all round like the one in the double room but bigger in size the hotel is located in a quieter street there are many high end shops in the area the metro station is approx five minute walk from the hotel and there s a taxi stand nearby taxi fare is quite reasonable in milan it is a good option to have when you want to go to the other side of the town to join a tour brera is a trendy and vibrant area nearby about ten minute walk away there are lots of restaurants to choose from the pinacoteco di brera an excellent art gallery not to be missed to visit and lovely little shops to browse into we arrived at the hotel from milano centrale railway station by taxi on departure the hotel reception has arranged a mercedes van to drop us back to the station both fares were reasonably charged compared to those of rome where we last stayed
