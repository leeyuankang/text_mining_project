this was our fifth stay at manzoni we like its location near via montenapoleone privacy traditional decor cleanliness and quiet surroundings very good value for money the hotel is well maintained some rooms have an unusual layout such as a long corridor but overall the rooms are sufficiently spacious and quite comfortable
