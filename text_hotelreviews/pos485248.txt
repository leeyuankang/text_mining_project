great location the hotel is well appointed and even if they were clearly very busy and full the staff still managed to impart prompt and personalized service i had bought some souvenirs from vencie prior to my trip to milan and needed a box to allow me to check them in for my flight home the front desk found me a good sized box and i was able pack my purchases perfectly i also found out that they had some facilities for fitness really just a treadmill a bike and some free weights in the nicely paneled basement but it was enough to ensure that i was able to stick to my running routine breakfast was very good too quite substantial the room was a good size the bathroom quite large both decorated and finished very elegantly
