we travelled with our small dog and were made most welcome and they did not charge extra although their info said they might there was a park very nearby which was essential as milan central has no grassy areas we has our wedding anniversary while we were there and when they realised they sent up complimentary drinks and a little cake we thought it was a lovely gesture the room was cool comfortable and large and immaculately clean we had booked a terrace room and it was lovely to sit there on an evening it was a minute walk to the duomo and minutes to the brera area where all the trendy eating places are my family stayed in the area next to the duomo and loved being in the noisy part however we were very pleased that we had chosen a quieter area
