the design of this little boutique hotel is superb every detail in the room is on point especially the parquet floor was beautiful and nice and cool during the summer heat the breakfast was very good excellent selection of sweet and savory dishes the location of the hotel is perfect close to all public transport sights shopping restaurants but not right in the middle of the noisy traffic and hustle and bustle rooms facing the inner courtyard are beautifully quiet and calm
