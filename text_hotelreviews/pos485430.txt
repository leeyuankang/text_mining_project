the staff was fabulous we arrived early and they checked but our room wasn t ready so they took all of our bags and when we returned later in the day everything had already been out into the room no they didn t unpack the room was great with a lovely balcony into an inner courtyard so we had no street noise the bed was really excellent the staff also arranged for a car to take us to the airport am yuck we only wish we could have stayed longer
