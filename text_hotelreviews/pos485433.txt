to start would i stay here again definitely this is a small boutique hotel with rooms on four floors that appear to be split into three separate room areas served by three separate lifts we were in room and there were three other rooms off our corridor the room had a large balcony with two relaxing chairs and overlooked the enclosed courtyard the d cor is very good the whole hotel clean and the staff were helpful and friendly we enjoyed using the sun roof in the evening to chill out on the very comfortable sun beds the breakfast was perfect for us but could be a bit lacking if you are really into cooked food there was a good selection of quality cold meats cheese cereals pastries fruit etc but only scrambled eggs and bacon on the cooked side the coffee and tea were very good quality as was the fruit juice we had a problem with our air conditioning on the first night and reported it the following day unfortunately it could not be fixed that day but we were given another room to sleep in or the option to move into that room for the remainder of our stay things can always go wrong but it is how they are dealt with that is important and the senato dealt with our issues very well indeed
