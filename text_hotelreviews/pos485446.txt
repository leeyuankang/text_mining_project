if you love to be within five minutes distance to the luxury shops in via monte napoleone i e chanel missoni tory burch hermes and many more and around this is one of the best affordable hotels in my view do not leave milan without seeing the display window of summer season by dolce gabbana located in via della spiga no coming to senato hotel the hotel is typically milanese trendy stylish modern and chic i had the best sleep ever in a hotel there was no noise there were rooms in the floor rooms in the floor and only rooms in the fifth highest floor although there are not many different choices in the buffet breakfast we found it very delicious and more than ok we appreciated the complementary fruit salad if the weather is nice try to have breakfast outdoor and enjoy secret garden golden door the garden is very enjoyable and cool at night as well we had franciacorta italian champagne and toast in a wonderful gold plate presentation i will always remember the decoration and accessories such as plates room closets lighting were in great harmony you feel the completeness of the decoration details in the entire hotel a useful tip for smokers our room had balcony looking at via senato we were during there during menswear fashion week and exhibitions were very nearby personnel was also very helpful and polite last but not least global blue has an office nearby via spirito no first floor so that you can receive cash vat refund there and benefit from fast track at the airport and avoid the crowd
