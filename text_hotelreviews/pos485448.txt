we had a junior suite for adults and children room and it was really nice beautiful and modern and clean large bathroom and cute little terrace as well the breakfast buffet was small but of good quality especially for the price euros the location is good for many of the upscale shops it s just a street over from that area on the tail end of our trip we stayed at a different hotel right next to the duomo and i think i probably preferred that location but this hotel is so lovely
