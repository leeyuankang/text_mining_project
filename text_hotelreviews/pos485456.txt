i couldn t fault this beautiful hotel from the moment i arrived the staff at reception concierge and the bar were friendly helpful knowledgeable and welcoming the decor was impeccable and sensitive to the original features with a beautiful balance of form and materials i have never slept so well on the superbly comfortable mattress and it was a treat to open my balcony door each morning and experience the open skies and peaceful water feature in the courtyard the small peace garden i named it the peace garden as it was so serene was the perfect place to unwind after walking the streets of milan all day finally the breakfast selection was presented so elegantly and was sublime way to start each day there is a beautiful park behind the hotel where you can go for a walk or a jog which is located within minutes walk or if you prefer a walk to via della spiga to visit the stores or the duomo then the hotel is within walking distance of all of the luxury shopping area sightseeing destinations thank you hotel senato staff i will be definitely returning next year
