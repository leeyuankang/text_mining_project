fantastic staff especially emanuelle in reception nothing was too much trouble i d sprained my ankle and they were most helpful sending someone out to buy me a bandage and extending my stay for a few hours so i could wait in the hotel for my taxi to the airport such pleasure to find this quality in a busy city
