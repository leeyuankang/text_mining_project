the bedroom and bathroom were modern spacious and beautifully decorated the staff especially at the concierge desk were so incredibly helpful that it made our stay all the more enjoyable and comfortable with designer stores on the street behind the hotel and the spectacular duomo only several minutes walk away i would certainly recommend the baglioni to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in the heart of the city s fashion district
