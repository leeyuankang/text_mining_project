the room was a big size its a very big hotel the breakfast room was crowded and the food was of average quality in the breakfast room when attempting to make a cup of tea the water was not clean but when we pointed this out a lovely employee gave us a teapot with hot water to make tea she then checked the machine and said that it needed a clean it was summer time and the aircon didn t work very well but it was not too uncomfortable the hotel is very easy access to the airport and city centre via train which was very handy overall the stay was good but personally i would not stay again as i prefer a good breakfast but it was a good budget hotel in a good location and it was a very nice looking place
