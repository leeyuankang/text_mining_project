room design was nice liked it a lot staff was very nice all interactions perfect nice reception staff all smooth and easy breakfast is buffet style the room can be very crowded as it s a kinda small room for the big guest capacity of the hotel the breakfast itself was okay plenty of choice quality okay the room itself is really nice design wise we felt well in there we had a minibar with all necessary things for a short stay like our nights all in all we liked it
