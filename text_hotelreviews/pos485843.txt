juniour suite room was sufficient for our needs and larger than the regular for milan we travelled in and out of milan exclusively by car and the location suited us very well train station is though at the very exit from the car park which may be quite convenient for ppl choosing the train instead nothing to see in the immediate vicinity but it is obvious that the property is maintained well enough to try compensate with green spaces flowers trees surrounding the car park etc and even maintain a security guy patrolling the car park at night
