three person room was spacious enough and the beds were good hotel design is over the top and some might say it s beyond tasteful anyway the stay was pleasant parking lot is big and staff friendly connection to the center is good with train or metro beware ticket machines in train station are not that easy to find breakfast was good enough to get the day started lots of pastries as usual in italy
