the room is spacious and the bed is really big and really comfortable you have everything you need in the room the breakfast was ok but due to the site of the hotel it was only buffet and nothing special but you will get toast cheese ham cake scambled egg with sausage and bacon coffee and juice is only from machines but tastes ok
