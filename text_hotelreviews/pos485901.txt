we stayed here for nights got room on floor with one double bed and one regular bed even only one double bed was booked room was large nice and clear free wifi breakfast very crowdy but always found a table big choice good coffee the staff was cleaning tables very quickly as well as filling the plates with food some travellers here in reviews complaid about the distance to the metro ok it was almost but we used it once if you have or city pass you can use also busses trams and trains and a train station is right behind the corner so you are there in few minutes from hotel in the centre you can transfer to metro very convenient
