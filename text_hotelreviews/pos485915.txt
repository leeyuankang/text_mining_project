the hotel is very nice seems new or restored at least for the price we paid we were expecting a standard room with normal comfort but what we found was a very cozy and modern bedroom almost extravagant but in line with the spirit of the hotel the breakfast is very good and absolutely fantastic regarding location and transportation the hotel is far from the center of the city but in milan it s the best option the train station is connected to the main lines and in you can get to the center
