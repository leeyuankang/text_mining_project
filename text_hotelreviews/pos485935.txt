this hotel is excellent value for money free wifi was great older building but has been refurbished a lot of families staying here included breakfast daily was plentiful and fresh sometimes very busy but the staff kept up with clearing tables well and we never had to wait for a seat big rooms with double beds that were very comfy right next to train station for milan centro always felt safe and car securely parked in private carpark with security onsite
