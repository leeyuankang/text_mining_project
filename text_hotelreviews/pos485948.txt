i like the staff who received me at late night she is very helpful but the one who was in the morning is not at all acceptable and i know the reason she was busy to manage many client at a time may be this was impact her day to day work so i am sorry i can t judge her as i was witnessed that she was very busy handling customer such busy time property must keep additional staff to maintain the service level it is not fair to blame her too but she is not able to care me and i suffered from her answer in your offer my category of membership we got some privilege which she simply refuse which is not acceptable
