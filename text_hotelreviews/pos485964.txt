the hotel had very nice interior and the staff were extremely helpful we needed to check out before breakfast as we had an early morning flight so they prepared a packed breakfast for us we walked to the centre which took around minutes where we found shops cafes restaurants and a supermarket the room was quiet in the evening and we had a good nights sleep the train station is very close by so it s not hard to get around milan if you re sightseeing
