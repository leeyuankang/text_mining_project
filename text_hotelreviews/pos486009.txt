although it is about km far from milan centre da vinci hotel is located near to train and metro stations the staff is helpful the breakfast buffet is huge and enormous eggs omelettes bacon mozzarella cakes apple cakes yogurt croisants toasts juices fruits you have so many choices to eat whatever you like the rooms are big nice and clean every day i recommend this hotel and i will choose it for my next trip to milan
