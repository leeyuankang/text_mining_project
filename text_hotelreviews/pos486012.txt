this hotel was super friendly on our arrival upgraded for free which was a nice touch outside of inner milan but you can walk minutes and get a train for minutes and you are in the centre the hotel itself was clean good bar seems popular with the hotel goers and residents if you walk minutes then there are a few restaurants around the hotel if you want a change of scenery good free parking outside good hotel for a stop over that has all the basics
