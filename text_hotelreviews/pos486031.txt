hotel da vinci is a hotel i d recommend to anyone staying in milan we received a triple room for nights at a really good value the staff were extremely helpful they directed us to our desired locations very warm welcome the breakfast buffet was amazing the big thing about the hotel is that it s a perfect location to get to places not far from the station and very close to duomo and central station
