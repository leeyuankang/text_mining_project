the hotel has very large comfortable rooms nice bathrooms large parking area and good breakfast but no coffee making facilities in room although every thing else is a star level it is just a mins walk to metro to access milan city you may park your car and buy a hr ticket metro bus from the cafe bar before going down the stairs of the metro which is also open late at night the problem with this hotel is to find it since there are no proper signs when you come over from the main road
