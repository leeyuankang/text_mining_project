we had some reservations about the location but it was perfectly fine a minute stroll to the subway which takes you to the city centre in about minutes for price through a very safe neighbourhood despite the way it looks also very close to the highway so it s great if you want to get out of the city to visit lake como or maggiore both reachable within an hour give or take depending on where you re going just past the subway station there s a good pizza place and just down the side street from there on the right there s a carrefour express a mini supermarket for those who don t know where you can get anything and everything
