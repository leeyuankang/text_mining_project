we booked a superior double room because we liked the design the room was huge bed very comfortable and clean the style of the hotel itself is nice as well to me the location was really good except if you plan to do things on foot there s not much nearby except some mcdonalds but on the other hand there is a big free parking behind the hotel and just a couple of meters away you can find the train station that brings you to the inner city we couldn t hear any noise from the trains in our room if you re looking for a hotel with a good price value free parking a nice room and public transport nearby and don t care about other facilities bar restaurant friendly staff i would recommend it breakfast selection was ok too
