this place was incredible the staff were personable and checking in was a sinch but let s talk about posh and comfort first the room sizes are adequate and the beds are super comfortable i loved the generous size of the rain shower shower that was the best the closets are enormous there is an in room safe and a cute little refrigerator breakfast was good and they had plenty of choices for every taste besides being a funky hotel who wouldn t want to stay in a big purple hotel if it s a big purple hotel you have make it your civic duty to stay there thanks guys
