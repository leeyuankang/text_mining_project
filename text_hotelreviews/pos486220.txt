first of all the place is not easy to find and if you drive car you cannot drive in from the main entrance there is another entrance for parking lot from behind the location is actually very very great since the train station is just beside the parking lot train to city center is available every half an hour only minutes with stops we ve got very helpful information from staffs room is spacious with a super big balcony anyway there is no great views out there
