the da vinci has changed since our first visit in it seems to me they have made cost cutting exercises in all their departments to keep their prices competitive although the rooms are still excellent in quality and the towels are plentiful the restaurant has changed its menu you can now eat from a buffet for a fixed price which means they have cut their waiting staff breakfast is still as good as it always was and the waiting staff give an excellent service
