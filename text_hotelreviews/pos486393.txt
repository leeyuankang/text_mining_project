the hotel was big and new check in process was quite slow the hotel s front is currently under construction and not mentioned there was quite a bit of noise in the morning also due to the construction work if you have a car you need to drive it out of the hotel and all the way around the block to get to the car park at the back of the hotel abit of an issue the hotel is generally over packed with tourist buses meaning breakfast is jam packed in the morning with the tourist from the buses going crazy over breakfast staff in the breakfast room was great they attended to requests such as coffee location wise the hotel is quite far out from the city centre there is a train station close by but abit of a walk and not too appealing at night with the surrounding the neighborhood isn t the best
