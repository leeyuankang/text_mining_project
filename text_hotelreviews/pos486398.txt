the rooms are very big the beds are enormous at a cost of for two nights it was an absolute steal breakfast is included which although continental it has a very big selection of food the decor inside may not be too everyone s taste but it gives itself to the name of the hotel rooms are extremely modern bathrooms are large and of a great quality this is our second time at this hotel and i would say it s by far the best value for money hotel in the city
