very convenient hotel for those who are traveling around italy by car and would like to stop in milan for one or two days the hotel can be easily reached from the highway and has a free parking which means you don t have to waste your time in the traffic jams and save parking costs up to h and day the train to milan center goes each minutes and stops just outside the fence of hotel the last train back to hotel departs from the center after the midnight so probably the hotel is not the best choice if you want to see the nightlife of milan but it is surely enough if you want to go out for an evening there is not much to say about the room it was very spacious and clean overall happy with this choice
