big hotel with big parking first impression was spoiled a bit because when we came to the room it wasn t ready for us at all when i went back to the reception and told the staff about this they upgraded our room to a suite which was a nice gesture the room was great the staff was very friendly especially the security guys they were very polite and helpful all the time one of them really saved us when our car hadn t started up in the morning
