myself and my husband enjoyed the fun furniture and the yummy breakfast the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was always kept to a high cleanliness standard we had come from london and so used the safe in the room to keep our possessions the cleaners were good as they kept our essentials topped up and provided new clean towels daily as we stayed at an off peak time the price was very reasonable however i am aware it can change in peak season
