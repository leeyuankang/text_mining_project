for our one night stay the hotel was great it was quiet we had a huge room sort of a family room with a small bed near the enormous king size bed we loved the shower very nice for a young couple on a romantic escape breakfast was ok there were quite a few choices salads cereals pastries cheese eggs bacon ham butter jams nutella juices yogurts i guess if you want a proper cappuccino latte you have to ask the waiters normal for italy for me the espresso machine sufficed this time
