excellent value for money in milan although our first room had a strong tobacco smell from previous guests we kindly asked the staff if we could change to another for the night which they promptly agreed staff did everything to make our stay perfect our second room looked just amazing just like the photographs far from city centre but actually very well served of public transportation perfect if you have car as the car park has a security guard
