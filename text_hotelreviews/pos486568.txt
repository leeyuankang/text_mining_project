we enjoyed our stay a lot even though we arrived at the guy at reception was helpful and friendly location might look like it is far from centre but actually it takes only around minutes to get to the duomo by metro breakfast was amazing good selection of food that will fit even vegan needs price is another great thing about this hotel we booked for nights and our total was about at the same level as beds in a hostel for the same period no brainer huh
