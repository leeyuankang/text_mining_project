read the reviews if this hotel after booking and was worried but it was wonderful rooms were decorated beautifully and huge i booked twin beds and were given two doubles bathroom was lovely free mini bar free to use safe great thick curtains to shut out the light used the restaurant once but although nice the menu wasn t my taste fussy eater breakfast was faultless so much choice can t see why anyone would disagree right next to metro so easy to explore milan this hotel probably my best yet in the last year of travelling for work very pet friendly too with non carpeted rooms can t wait to go says me who s fussy about everything if i had one complaint that would be no kettle but i carry one anyway
