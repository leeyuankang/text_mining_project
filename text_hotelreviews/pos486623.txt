the hotel rooms were spotlessly clean and generously sized the breakfast buffet is superb with a great choice of food free parking is an added bonus although difficult to find initially there are very helpful polite gentlemen and helpful girl on reception but sadly they are the exception the rest of the staff are at best surly and at worst rude
