bedroom is a very good size aircon works well bed is super comfy and the shower toilet is quite good too breakfast is included with many options available free parking it was not perfect but the hotel offers great value for money near enough to get to the centre of milan good if you are visiting lake como as well as it is a short drive away from here will definitely come back
