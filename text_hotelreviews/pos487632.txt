this is possibly the best hotel in milan with a view over looking the duomo the rooms are huge and very modern they give you a bottle of prosecco as a welcome to the room the staff are world class and are very helpful the restaurant on the rooftop is a michelin star restaurant and well worth the visit the breakfast restaurant is delightfully set among hundreds of wine bottles and gives off a warm comfortable feeling
