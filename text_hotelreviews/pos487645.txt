probably the perfect location for milano first timers that wish to stay central the look from the small balcony to the plaza duomo is truly stunning exactly like in the pictures the top terrasse is a perfect spot for relaxing with a drink or a cup of coffee the times we sat there we were the only ones the old galleria is a really nice place with lots of great restaurants and shops all top tourist spots like la scala and a lot of interesting museums are with a minutes walking distance metro station is meters away it takes approximately minutes to stroll to the central station if you don t have too much luggage with you
