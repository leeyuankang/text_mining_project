the location of this hotel is amazing on the first night of our stay there was a performance of the strong italian choir on the steps of the duomo which we were able to listen to and see from our balcony the staff were friendly and helpful very near the galleria and main historic sites and monuments red bus tour and taxi stop also on the square the breakfast was great but only one waitress that was run off her feet although lovely to deal with
