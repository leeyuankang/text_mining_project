the overhead shower had scalding hot water the facilities were not managed and looked after properly the gym shower did not work it has an excellent location but needs better facilities management i would pull on a lever in the bathroom and it would pop out when i complained i felt the manager seemed just to shift the blame instead of taking responsibility and action for the situation the room also gets a lot of light from the courtyard so if you have sleeping issues not the best location to be in
