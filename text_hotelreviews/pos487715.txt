location just perfect literally minute walk to duomo and the galleria and so unusual but nice to have our room looking inside the galleria staff were great so friendly and welcoming on arrival and departure we were also doing our wedding pre nuptial photo shoot in the area and took a few shots inside the hotel lobby which really look good bed so comfortable and great bathroom toiletries loved this hotel and cannot wait to stay here again
