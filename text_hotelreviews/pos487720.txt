location is great room is of decent size and comfortable however it s notable that the amenities are getting a bit old temperature of shower is inconsistent or hard to control power points in the room are coming off but all in all i enjoyed my stay here there s only a small bar cafe in this hotel but the staff are amazingly friendly and professional love the wine and food here even though choices are limited
