what i like beautiful hotel in a convenient location walkable to both rialto and st mark s square gracious and warm service unlike some other european establishments where staff can be perfunctory and supercilious spacious rooms that are very well maintained extensive breakfast spread rooms are quiet bathrooms are big with full shower cubicle water access right by the front door allowing water taxis to drop you off right there
