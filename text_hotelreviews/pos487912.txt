location is the key highlight of this hotel tucked away just off the piazza al duomo it made it very easy for us to make pit stops in the midst of a hectic sightseeing schedule the staff were extremely helpful our room was smallish but comfortable with a very nice large bathroom nice robes towels slippers toileteries i thought the free soft drinks is a very meaningful touch
