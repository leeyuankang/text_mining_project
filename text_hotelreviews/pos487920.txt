what s not to like staff are fabulous they care for every need all the little things provided free breakfast free mini bar non alcoholic we had an early tour they made up a breakfast box with all the goodies we required again no cost we didn t have a kettle to make a cuppa this seems common for many hotels they arranged for a kettle in our room and brought up tea bags etc couldn t recommend this place highly enough one of the best hotels i have stayed at
