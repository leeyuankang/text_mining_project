i usually stay at starhotels rosa grand which is more pricey but lovely but had family staying nearby starhotels ritz so decided to try this property they also have a garage attached to the property and even though it was a hefty a night it was worth the convenience as with the rosa grand the breakfast is very good the location of this hotel is also better right off corso buenos aires the room was extremely clean and had everything you need it s not as luxurious as the rosa grand but is certainly a very nice property for the price i d recommend it to friends
