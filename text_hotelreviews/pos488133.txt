we were given an upgrade by a lovely man on reception he explained us everything we needed to know in great detail and was very welcoming our room was beautiful we had everything we could of possibly asked for and even more they have a fitness centre on the floor which was small but very well equipped they also had a sauna and turkish bath along with a roof top terrace overlooking beautiful milan i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable luxury stay in milan
