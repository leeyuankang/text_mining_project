everything was perfect even tho the walk from the hotel to the duomo is about minutes the hotel is located behind the main street of milan and the best thing is that there s a metro minutes away from the hotel that leads to many locations including the duomo the walk is increddible since you have a lot of restaurants bars museums parks a lot of stores and incredibble buildings the room is beautiful very clean and comfortable and the stuff is extraordinary
