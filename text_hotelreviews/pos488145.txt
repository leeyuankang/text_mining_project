location was great just off the main street so free from the hustle and bustle of corso buenos airies great little cafe next door to the hotel really good service and pricing hotel is a nice walk to the duomo takes about but plenty of metro stops just a few steps away if you want to take the metro fridge in the room so nice to store small bottles of water in and some fresh milk which you can get from the supermarket walk away
