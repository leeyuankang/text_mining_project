the staff was nice enough to upgrade us to a suite as soon as we checked in which was great the room was very nice with a small sitting area and free wifi the location was great as it was right off via buenos aires which is one of the main streets in the city loaded with people shops and places to eat in addition they included breakfast in the room charge which is a big plus if you cannot wait until the restaurant opens at am you can grab coffee and a roll in the lobby which worked perfect for us as we had to catch an early train there is also a bar caf right down the street so you can grab a drink in the evening with the locals if you like i stayed at a beautiful hotel on via buenos aires the weekend before but i spent a lot more for a very small room and had to request to be moved to a larger room the room cost significantly more and did not include any breakfast so i will plan to stay at starhotels ritz next time as it is a better value and i liked the room much better
