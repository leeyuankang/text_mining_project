the location of this hotel was excellent about a walk from the train station and a minute walk from the nearest metro station the local supermarket was minutes away for drinks and snacks i especially liked the little fitness suite with its steam room and sauna excellent use of space in the hotel and the staff were very friendly the breakfast included was a good bonus lots of variety and everything appeared to be fresh lovely the bed was very comfortable and the ensuite shower had good water pressure very important no one wants to have a shower under a drip i would also like to add that as our return flight was not until the evening we asked if we could have a late checkout and the hotel very kindly did not charge us for this what superb customer service oh yes the daily complimentary chocolate was lovely
