the location is very convenient to main streets bus and subway connections if you don t mind some slightly longer walks a lot of areas can be located on foot also the city hop on hop off bus is a good idea to get the lay of the land the room was clean and comfortable the staff was very helpful but a little short on personnel at times it was hard to locate some one for room service
