it was very close to the lima metro station line no around there were plenty of shops and pretty nice terraces so basically it was an excellent location sufficiently far from the center so that not so many tourists come around therefore perfect for someone interested in discovering the city without hoards of tourists around pretty decent breakfast nice staff and very good rooms
