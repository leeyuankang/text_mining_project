i stayed for my birthday got a nice happy birthday card cake very nice helpful staff they try their best to understand your requirements regardless of your french language skills the concierge helped me to book dinner in a restaurant that i wanted to try the location is good for those who look for a quiet stay and do not mind walking for few minutes to the champs lys es taxis are available easily too and not too expensive
