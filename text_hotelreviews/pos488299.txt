overall it s an ok hotel with quite good location the rooms were clean and not too dated the wifi is free for entire stay even though it tries to deceive you saying it s only hours you just have to re login with room number every day location is quite ok close to the metro station there are shops nearby and its stops to city center however if you arrive from central station it is minute walk with suitcases or a metro lines journey with wagon switch not that convenient perhaps a taxi is a better option
