the location of this hotel is in very calm area and it is just meters from corso buenos aires which is famous for shopping and where you can find several restaurants and a minutes walk from metro station the room didn t have a kettle but i asked them for one and they said that they would check if there is available and they supply a set with set of tea coffee and cappuccino every day which was very nice from them there are lifts in quite a small size which is ok the room is exactly as the photos show in the site
