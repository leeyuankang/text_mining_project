the staff was always accommodating and helpful whether we needed help with a reservation or an extra for our room they were patient with our rudimentary french and always willing to speak with us in english when hailing a cab for us they always made sure we could communicate our destination to the driver the room was beautiful and the bed and pillow the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel the location was wonderful just a few steps from the arc de triomphe and champs de elysses and just a short cab ride to many of paris landmarks
