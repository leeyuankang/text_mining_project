it was our second stay in starhotels ritz in the same week so this definitely speaks for itself i ve reviewed the hotels on my first booking but its always fair to do so on each occasion staff was very helpful as the first time and location is very adequate for all the shopping access thatmilan offers underground station is minutes away which makes it also very convenient the rooms were super clean and since the expo was over we were given a larger than usual room
