the staff were super which really makes such a huge difference in any hotel the room and the hotel in general was extremely clean and everything worked the way it should complimentary water everyday was very welcomed i rarely find this in hotels outside the middle east espresso machine in the room was fantastic should be a new requirement to get a star rating if you have a special occasion the hotel is more than happy to help you organize anything ahead of your trip from flowers to chocolates to even reservations
