outrageously attentive and accommodating staff they go out of their way to show you a pleasant and enjoyable stay they sent amenities to our room upon hearing my wife was celebrating her birthday junior suite was amazingly designed in terms of space and storage well thought out floor plan where every possible amenity is within your reach fantastic memory foam bed this is very much a five star hotel this stay was the highest standard of hospitality
