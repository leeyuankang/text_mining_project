fab hotel in a perfect location food in the restaurant was beautiful and the pillows mattress were like heaven staff were lovely and friendly and at our disposal throughout this was a surprise for my fiance s birthday not only did they upgrade our room with no charge but they also left a lovely chocolate cake in our room whilst we were out we would definitely recommend
