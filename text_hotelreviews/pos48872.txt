location is great for central paris business and activities staff is incredibly friendly and professional much more than in comparably star rated parisian hotel nearby and even more so than in other sofitel hotels i stayed at truly differentiating rooms are good hotel is quiet restaurant is nice and breakfast is exceptionally fresh and enticing so is the restaurant staff really great and i hardly ever go overboard when it comes to hotels
