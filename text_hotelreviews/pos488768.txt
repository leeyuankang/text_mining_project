about meters to the metro station quiet far from the touristic zone of the city but it takes min from the centre to nearest metro station and it takes maximum mins walk biggest problem for us was we couldn t go out late in the night not that it was not safe but there was nothing arround and metro is closed at nice hotel by the way very nice staff and very clean
