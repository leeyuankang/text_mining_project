we actually liked absolutely everything about this hotel please please don t be put off by the negative comments on here we nearly cancelled our booking because we read such bad comments but are so glad we didn t we are very particular and stay at hotels regularly and we were very happy the hotel is very clean the buffet breakfast was exceptional with lots of choice including a hot breakfast choice offering bacon sausage eggs etc and the chocolate and custard croissants were delicious it definitely sets you up for the day the metro is literally at the end of the road so if you go out of the left side of the hotel you just walk to the end of the road and you will see it there so easy we stayed here from dec for five nights and so were there for new year and they had a new years eve party and for euros you had a five course meal and red nad white wine included which was off a very good quality we were also given a bottle of prosecco at midnight to do a toast it was a great evening with live music if you go to the bar early evening there are complimentary snacks which i think is a nice touch all the staff on reception were really lovely and the young girl jessica in the restaurant was really helpful and a real credit to your staff the room we booked was a suite and was perfect in every way spacious and the bed very big and comfortable also complimentary toiletries we went to lake como and didn t book a trip so asked reception for directions which is so easy and you save a lot of money we did do the bernina express which is a train that goes to the swiss alps which was really fantastic the hotel also provide a free transfer to the central bus station in milan regularly through the day which is really great we will definitely return to this hotel in the future loved it
