the hotel s facilities were excellent we stayed in a suite to provide extra space for our year old to walk around in it was far more space than we had expected there were separate balconies as well as a walk in closet that was the size of an entire hotel room in a downtown location sure it s outside the city center but with just a minute walk to the metro this value could not be beat
