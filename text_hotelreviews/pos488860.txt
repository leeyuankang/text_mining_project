very comfortable beds friendly and helpful staff who tend to your needs quickly i had a problem with the wifi strength from the room i was in and within minutes a member of staff was there to help and fixed my problem great cocktails if you re a whiskey drinker i suggest the whiskey and shrub cocktail it is located only a few minutes from a lovely park and only a minute walk to the nearest metro station which are very frequent and reliable there are some good restaurants near by too we found one called the new friday where the food was amazing and also great value for money
