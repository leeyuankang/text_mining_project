i can t find anything bad to say about this hotel they could have a bigger spa sometimes the spa could be overcrowded but thats nothing that bothered me the breakfast was really good even though i ve heard that the breakfasts at hotels in milano had a lower standard so all positive feedback if i ever visit milano again i ll be staying here for sure
