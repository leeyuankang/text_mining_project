i stayed nights a nice place clean a walking distance from the duomo minutes breakfast was good not much variety though lobby bar restaurant was ok staff were friendly check in out super fast my room was so small but as a solo traveler i don t need more space wifi was slow and kept cutting off tv channels had only a couple of english channels would be nice if more price was reasonable had good deal through booking
