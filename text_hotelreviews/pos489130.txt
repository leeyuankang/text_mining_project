the hotel is a min taxi ride away from milan linate airport we have walked most places and it s very close to the metro if you don t like walking there is a park no more then minutes walk away from the hotel which is lovely for the kids it has so much to do i highly recommend this hotel if you are travelling with young children at breakfast they gave me a plastic cup and bowl to help and the a colouring book which really helped us feel more comfortable during breakfast time the bar staff are great they give you snacks with your drink very very helpful lots of good places to eat near the hotel
