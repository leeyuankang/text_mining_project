we were upgraded for free to a junior suite from a standard room on arrival to the hotel which is always lovely the front desk staff was friendly and helpful particularly marta the rooms were clean and comfortable and the breakfast was lovely the hotel was conveniently located near a metro and the central station and walking distance from city centre i would definitely stay again if we return to milano
