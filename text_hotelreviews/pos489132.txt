overall this is a clean and simple property i liked the design modern and sleek the breakfast was amazing i could have kept eating were it not for the fact i had a train to catch it s located just close enough to the central rail station to be close and convenient but far enough to be away from the criminals that troll the area it s close to a metro stop repubblica and therefore only one stop away from the rail station
