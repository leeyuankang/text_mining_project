i would definitely stay here again it s a little outside the central part minutes walk which was perfect for us as we had no city noises keeping us up at night so we slept really well arrival speedy booking in despite other customer reviews we were upgraded very pleasant surprise hotel reception very friendly and informative staff room spacious modern very clean expected to be clean but it doesn t hurt to point this out for other guests certainly adequate for adults sharing i chose to sleep on the sofa bed very comfortable and good night s sleep mini bar didn t use however can advise the charges are reasonable for italy as they reflect many restaurant charges for the same products breakfast to on sunday they serve until midday although we were out and about by this time but useful to know for those that like a lie in great choice and they constantly top up and they accommodate you if you have allergies just let the staff know choice the usual continental sausages bacon eggs scrambled or boiled fellow brits no baked beans if you feel you need them hahaha but really on holiday you can do without these for a few days cereals yoghurts cheeses cold sliced meat selection salad bowls spoilt for choice when it comes to bread croissants plenty of condiments also fruit fresh fruit juices hot bevarages could not go wrong to be fair location for us it was just right we could walk everywhere and the republica metro station is nearby use republica not turati just be careful as there are numerous exits and it s a little confusing at first to get your bearings we used the barclays bank as our landmark handy as walking does get tiring when it s hot and humid plus the hotel is walking distance or metro stop ride from barigaldi station which for us was good as from here we took the train to lake como for the day
