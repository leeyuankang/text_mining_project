the location of this hotel was excellent i had the best three nights sleep and the breakfast was varied and plentiful the breakfast staff were particularly attentive just a hint the cue for breakfast is quite long after an absolute bonus was being able to use the hotels bicycles for free cruising around milan was great fun and we found our way to the duomo galleria and some lovely parks in no time highly recommend this busy but efficient hotel
