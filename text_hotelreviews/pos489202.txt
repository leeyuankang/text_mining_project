excellent stay the room was lovely and the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in great choice for breakfast which was open til on sunday free toiletries and hairdryer in the room along with tea and coffee making facilities and a bathrobe with slippers the hotel is just over the road to the republicca metro station which takes around mins to get to duomo we stayed for just one night but would definitely stay for longer if we returned to milan
