the staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful they were more than happy to offer advice about the best places to go for dinner and how to get there etc the breakfast was excellent and it didn t finish too early weekdays which is nice when on holiday the selection was very good a mix of continental and some english they had english tea the location is good we liked it it is not in the middle of the hustle and bustle but we prefer this it is about a minute walk into the duomo at the heart of the city metro station minute walk away also central station only about minute walk which was perfect for us as we were travelling on to other places rooms on the small side but perfectly formed very clean and comfy bed
