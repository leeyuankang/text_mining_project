the breakfast was generous and very good and the environment classy and clean i also liked the fact that the hotel was not actually in the center of all the action but a short ride from my conference and all amenities it was a good quiet place and nice not to see any dodgy characters on the street check in and check out was super quick and its worth it to take the cab to central station no point carrying a big bag all the way down the street
