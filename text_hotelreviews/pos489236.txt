the room was brilliant very comfortable extremely clean and very modern and relaxing to be in breakfast was fantastic and had plenty of choice staff were very helpful and very friendly and even gave the kids a little tub of gummy bear sweets as we left such a nice gesture would definitely return to the nh hotels
