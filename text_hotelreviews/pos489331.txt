the location was excellent we were able to walk from central station in more or less a straight line to our hotel and it was only a ten minute walk to the historic centre of town the staff at the hotel were extremely efficient and friendly particularly our waiter luca breakfast and dinner were both excellent and for this reason we ate at the hotel a lot price was very reasonable for the location would definitely return
