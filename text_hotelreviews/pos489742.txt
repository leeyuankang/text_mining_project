it s your standard marriott clean good sized rooms great view from higher floors good location walking distance from porta garibaldi train station staff was very friendly helped with directions and recommendations several times had a companion leave a bag by the taxi stand by accident when we arrived and someone turned it in nice to know we were staying with honest people
