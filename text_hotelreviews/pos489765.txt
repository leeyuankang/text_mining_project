great location if you need ready access to garibaldi station there s a ramped underpass from just outside the hotel into the station so it s easy to take luggage other than the station there s not much there but there s plenty of public transport to get you anywhere you want to go in milan the hotel is very comfortable nice bar good breakfast clean and well run staff is fantastic
