we had a one night stop over at this hotel on our journey from naples to london and chose it for its proximity to milan porta garibaldi train station we were surprised by how easy it was to get from the hotel to milan s historic centre we caught a tram from a stop not far from the hotel entrance and it was a pleasant journey of about minutes to the cathedral the staff were very helpful providing us with our tram tickets and suggesting an excellent restaurant near the castle
