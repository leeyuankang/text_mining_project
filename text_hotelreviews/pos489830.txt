the room was clean and a good size for a single person the staff were friendly particularly the breakfast staff breakfast was good although the pancakes were cold on the second day with the machine seemingly switched off location was good right next to the metro and minutes on the tube into the city centre although there weren t any good restaurants or bars that i could see nearby so i d recommend going in the city
