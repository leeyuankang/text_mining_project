this is a very nice hotel located within a short metro ride from the known attractions of milan duomo expo navigli in an elegant district that is not overcrowded with tourists i liked very much the design of the interior which is a combination of old and modern elements and the hotel garden smelling with pine trees in addition the hotel offers a rich breakfast that makes a good start of the day i would definitely come back when next time in milan
