we came for a day break in milan and the nhow hotel was fantastic modern art on display in the foyer stylish rooms where little confectionery treats would appear after a day out the best breakfast in history served by superb ladies francesca adellia and monica and generally the friendliest welcome ever by the staff including the lovely andrea in guest relations made this a wonderful stay cool and chic but very welcoming i loved coming through the entrance hall with its amazing metre screen of motion graphics some hotels make you feel like you re a hindrance here they welcomed you like family
