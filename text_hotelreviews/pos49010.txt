we took a while to find this property as it is at the back of la sarbonne place but once found it was actually in a perfect quiet location it is a five minute walk from the river seine and notre dame which was perfect to start a bus tour of paris it is also a two minute walk from les jardin de luxembourg which is a beautiful building and a lovely area to sit and relax sadly we didn t have time for the catacombs but this is also a minute walk it is a great base to go back to it has everything you need and there are plenty of restaurants nearby for dinner the staff were amazing and really helpful and the bed was comfortable and the rooms are quiet i would definitely stay here again
