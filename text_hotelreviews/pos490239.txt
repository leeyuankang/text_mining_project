i spent one week in this hotel for a technical conference in politechnico di milano location of hotel is very good and you can transfer hotel by train from malpensa airport you should get off from the train in bovisa station and you can reach hotel by walk only in minutes ticket price is euro hotel is very close to bus station metro and tramvay you can buy tickets from hotel in bus station you can still use wireless staff is very kind and helpful rooms are quite large and everything you need is in the room even a microwave breakfast was perfect you can drink freshly squeezed orange juice as much as you want i will visit this hotel if i come to milano again
