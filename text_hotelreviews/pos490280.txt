excellent experience hotel staff was very friendly and helpful amenities provided in room were great and complimentary wine was a nice gesture big room plenty of space big bathroom with tub and separate shower as well location was another plus point bus stand is right in front of hotel takes you directly to city center i ll definitely recommend this hotel
