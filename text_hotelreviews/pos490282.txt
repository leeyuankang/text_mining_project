spacious and well equipped room with good quality furniture staff was excellent the location is quite good if you are coming by car since you don t have to go deep into the city which can be a pain in milan and we found some street parking which turned out to be quite ok to leave the car for a couple of days at least during public holidays also there is a frequent bus with stops close to the hotel
