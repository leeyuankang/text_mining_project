this hotel was perfect from the friendly staff to the amazing decor around the hotel the room was very well presented and the whole hotel looked and felt very clean the gym was a bit small but sufficient the pool and sauna were good wifi connection was good throughout the whole hotel i was a bit concerned about the location of the hotel prior to my trip but getting into the centre of milan was very easy just a short minute walk to the villapizonne station and or stops later you re in the centre i was extremely impressed by this hotel highly recommended
