it was nice to have hotel s own parking place as we took our own car very spacious room for the business class but little cold even we adjusted room temperature to degrees nespresso machine was nice so we enjoyed using it we were wondering why hotel did not have any order for omelet then our last breakfast at the hotel they set the memo on the table that guests can order it it seems they just started to serve egg meals
