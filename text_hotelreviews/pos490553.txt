apart from not picking the breakfast option this was a great stay to get from malpensa airport to the hotel we used the metro which wasn t difficult as the lines are numbered although you can get the overground to the hotel which takes minutes hotel staff were fab informative and helpful would stay here again not many places to eat around the hotel but there is a small essential store near the hotel
