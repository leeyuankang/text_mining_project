i was excited to book in this hotel as i am a marriott silver elite member and was my first time in milan unfortunately the location is not as i read it is far from the center and need like half an hour to get there also the hotel is so oldd and there was ants in the room i was really scared when i saw the invasion of ants in bulks in the bathroom i talked with the front office manager at that time and showed her the pic of ants she changed the room but actually that was just a night before the departure and we were seeing ants from day one and calling housekeeping who used to come just put some antiseptic i am very disappointed the office manager mentioned a compensation for this but never received anything
