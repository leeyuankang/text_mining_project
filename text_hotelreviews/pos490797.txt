the location is excellent with the metro central station and trams within a few minutes walk from the hotel we were upgraded to stay in a suite on the floor which was an absolute treat and the front desk staff were very helpful milan was our last port of call having driven around various cities and we both wished we could have stayed at this hotel for longer thank you we will definitely stay at this hotel again
