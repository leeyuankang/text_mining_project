wonderful grand old hotel a little worn around the edges but very clean with a wonderful staff great breakfast in the morning with extended hours fabulous location walking distance to train station but not so close as to have the train station riff raff will stay here again rocco at the front desk a powerful and handsome man tracked me down after checking out to return my ipad free wifi and guest computer with printer friendly place to stay for business or vacation this hotel was reccomended by my contact who has lived in milano all his life very good value worth more than i paid
