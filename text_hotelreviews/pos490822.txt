classic and gorgeous breakfast was so nice and staff was friendly we stayed in junior suite for adults very wide and enough space to open baggage location is a little bit boring around here is many local apartments but here is very nice a one night for first day or last day of milan we could have enough time to sum up our baggage until check out if you forget something local supermarket simply was just in front of the hotel
