the location is what i liked most it is just beside the train station we got off the train and walked to the hotel we stayed for a couple of days and then caught the light rail train to the airport for our flight home it was also easy to get to the historical centre using the subway which is also just there we found a good restaurant just around the corner i like the hotel the staff were very helpful the eataly restaurant in the hotel was reasonably priced the staff were lovely and the wine was fantastic highly recommend it the room was comfy and clean it was also green which i like
