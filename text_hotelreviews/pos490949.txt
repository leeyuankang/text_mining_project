the concept and feel of the hotel and how it was run was very good we loved the garden atmosphere of the foyer and found ourselves wanting to come back and relax after a big day in a busy city like milan the staff and management made you feel very welcome we will definately be recommending this hotel to stay in milan and will stay again bed was very comfortable breakfast was great we look forward to visiting more of the star hotels chain through europe
