the hotel s restaurant was excellent and very good value our bed was the most comfortable of all the beds that we had come across on our italian holiday the staff were all very efficient and friendly at reception in the restaurant at breakfast and in the rooms it was very impressive and although we were on a leisure trip we could see that their business and conference facilities were very well organised minutes walk from central station
