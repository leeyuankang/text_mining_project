great location from the train station as we were leaving via train the next morning despite prior information found this location quite safe greeted warmly by porter as soon as we entered the hotel room small but pristine wonderful array of breakfast food wonderful only negative was policy re getting an iron and ironing board we were told we had to return same within an hour of use found this strange but understand that we are not in the us when hotels usualay provide this in the rooms overall a great stay after an overnight from the us porter even offered to take our luggage to the train station the next morning out of rating would stronglyou recommend this hotel to felow travelers
