walking distance to milano cetrale and therefore easy access to metro piazza del duomo can be reached after few stations good restaurants in the neighbourhood of the hotel nice very clean and modern rooms good wi fi connection limited to two devices breakfast is basic but adequate we would certainly book this hotel again
