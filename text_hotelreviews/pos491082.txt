rooms were very comfortable and nicely appointed loved the extra touch that we could order a pillow to suit our needs soft firm etc hotel was clean lovely fresh smell is piped into the foyer quite a funky vibe to it which we liked staff were amazingly efficient lovely bar area and the restaurant looked excellent although we only had breakfast there
