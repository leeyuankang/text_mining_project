everything was fine very nice staff i really appreciated that they provided us with a city map without asking the location is perfect if you arrive by train this hotel is the best choice easy to find min to the railway station but you don t hear a sound at all min to duomo by underground we just arrived dropped down the lagguages and we headed straight away to the centre comfy bed clean bath free wifi nice design breakfast is also ok quick check in and out really good value for the money
