all of the above not overdone but in our opinion it is just right with clean modern design and a beautiful ground level view toward an old restored piece of milan architecture next door the staff was very professional courteous and engaging our italian is a bit rusty but the staff would allow us to us it as far as our skills held out the location of the echo hotel was absolutely perfect for our needs right next to milano centrale rail station and the centrale metro stop it is perfect for getting to anywhere in milan or to any city in italy
