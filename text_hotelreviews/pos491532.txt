very nicely appointed hotel in a nice area excellent value for the money clean will stay again without hesitation we just stayed for a night on the way to linate airport the staff recommended an excellent restaurant the airport is very easy to reach the bus stop is within minutes walk and it s a minute easy ride while not in the centre it s close enough to make location convenient to get around
