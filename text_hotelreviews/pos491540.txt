the hotel has very friendly and helpful staff and is sited in a good location close to the city center the breakfast is nice rich and tasty the rooms are not very big but comfortable and clean with my genius discount it provides an excellent value for the money with the regular price it is still ok i really enjoyed my stay and will come back
