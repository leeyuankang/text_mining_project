the hotel is barely minutes bus ride bus from the terminal s door at linate airport the tickets are just euro single from a machine at the stop on the way back get them from a news stand so no costly taxis necessary the receptionist was a beaming young lady very helpful with storing our luggage before the room was ready helpful with directions to near distant attractions she took the trouble to find out opening hours location of local markets and gave us directions to navigli a canal district packed with eateries she also remembered we asked for a room with windows opening for the night facing a side street and while there proved to be no kettle in the room as per usual in italian hotels the kitchen served us tea at no added cost so staff were great the room itself bathroom were very clean with fantastic working shower loads of room to put the luggage in any case we came to la scala to walk watch shop ourselves dizzy not to sit in the room but the bed was heavenly after the long day out the breakfast offered a wide choice including a fine selection of local dolci we are usually rather critical of hotels we stay at often move rooms sometimes more than once but there was no need for that at bianca maria thank you we felt pampered
