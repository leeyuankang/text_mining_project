the hotel was a good value for the location not in the middle of everything but if you are willing to walk minutes or so to the main sights and attractions it is worth it i was there on a sunday so many stores and restaurants were closed but when i walked around there seemed to be a number of options for other days of the week my room was on the small side but it was comfortable and quiet the breakfast was good especially when compared to the usual italian breakfast plenty of savory and sweet options both hot and cold the internet connection was also good the tram line that goes to the central station is located very close to the hotel so it would be an easy ride there and back
