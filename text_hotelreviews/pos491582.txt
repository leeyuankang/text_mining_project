the staff were wonderful we had excellent service throughout our stay which was only one night a pity from reception to porters and restaurant staff we had top notch assistance the room was spotless nice size bathroom free water in the minibar and the beds were firm but comfortable full set of toiletries provided it s beautifully designed the decor is modern and classy tram stops away will take you directly to the centre breakfast was delicious i would definitely stay there again
