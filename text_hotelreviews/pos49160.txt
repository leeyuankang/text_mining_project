beautifully presented hotel in one of the best parisian neighbourhoods surrounded by an exciting range of shops attractions restaurants and bars and only a minute walk from two metro stations the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful the rooms are spotlessly clean smartly decorated and blessedly quiet even on weekend nights and the beds are quite comfortable i will definitely stay at the hotel op ra richepanse when i visit paris again and highly recommend staying here my husband and i stayed at the hotel for a celebratory holiday but i would say it s well suited for families with young children as well as business trips
