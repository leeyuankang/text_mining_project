excellent location very close to the city center you could either walk or take the tram and also very close to a very busy street full of stores if you didn t feel like going to the center at all nice and spacious room actually i got an upgrade thanks full of little amenities the breakfast was very good typical continental buffet brakfast with a wide range of choices both sweet and salty
