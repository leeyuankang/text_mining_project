the room was spacious the mattress gave our jet lagged bodies a great night s sleep enabling us to fully recover the bathroom facilities were ample and up to date breakfast was good and with a good variety of items to choose from the best part was the staff starting with corinna the general manager alice at the front desk and gregorio the head waiter they all made our stay super pleasant
