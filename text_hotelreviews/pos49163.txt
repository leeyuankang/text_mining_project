the staff was absolutely incredible and went above and beyond to make this a fantastic stay they even went so far as to acknowledge it was my partner s birthday and were kind enough to leave her a note congratulating her can honestly say i ve never been this impressed with an accommodation location was great walking distance of the louvre and right in the center of the arrondisement and the room itself was perfect wish we could have stayed more than just one night and definitely planning to return
