the management and staff are amazing i actually had a glitch with booking com where they cancelled by booking last minute and messed it up for me but the management at the hotel was brilliant they sorted it out in no time gave me the same rate i booked originally and also upgraded my room all this just added to a really good experience in milan the reception is well informed of the local attractions and directions etc and is just brilliant and so helpful the facilities are clean and very nice amazing breakfast buffet lovely hotel walk to the center and again amazing service
