i changed my booking a number of times as my grown up children decided to join us the staff were very helpful and adaptable in particular michael was very good at making recommendations for restaurants in brera and walks along the canals he was also happy to recommend different streets for shopping and the best connections on the different trams free bottled water in the rooms was also a nice touch
