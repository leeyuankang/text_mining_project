good location within a walking distance of the city center and just around a walk from the university very good breakfast with a lot of options a comfortable bed good sound isolation wifi available in every part of the hotel with good speed water available at the room free of charge we arrived during a period of a lot of movement at the hotel with a lot of people checking in and out and our room was not quite ready however the staff at the reception was super nice apologized for the inconvenience and offered us welcome drinks at the bar due to the anti terrorism measures all around europe we were asked to sign a consent stating that we accept that our personal data may be checked for security reasons the thing is that we were only told the purpose of the consent after we sign it please next time do it the other way around explain the purpose then ask to sign it everyone will sign it either way it is just a suggestion and not a critique
