amazing staff and hotel close to city center what i consider a great and valuable idea is the mineral water in the room minibar there are as well other hotels which offer a free bottle of water but in this hotel you have enough bottles a refilled fridge everyday in order to drink and take away with you during your journey in milan a small innovation that goes to great things hotel is looking nice outside and inside cosy rooms amazing personnel especially the lady receptionist that resembles selma hayek breakfast buffet is very good having enough variety for everyone served inside or outside on the terrace there is also available a bar on the rooftop
