i really enjoyed my stay for two days as i was working from the room i apprichiated the office desk in the room and the room service the room was luxory and nice too bad you can open the windows and that there was no real mini bar and only water the location was great and central the hotel was nicer in real life comparing to the pictures at bookings i also loved the bathroom and great shower
