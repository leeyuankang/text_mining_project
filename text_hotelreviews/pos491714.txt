the entire staff was excellent very friendly and quick to respond to our request we love the bathroom and the amazing rain shower best in italy so far the overall d cor was quite nice with quirky material and color schemes location was convenient min walk to duomo we had the corner room with large windows which was nice but the layout seems very inefficient so it didn t feel as spacious the mini bar was excellent
