the bed was very comfortable amazing room with a massive shower the view from the room was really nice and also the room had its own fridge which was refilled daily with bottles of still and sparkling water the staff were always very polite and helpful with any questions we had and we were given some excellent restaurant recommendations we stayed to celebrate our year anniversary which we noted in our booking comments the hotel recognised this and gave us a gift to celebrate it
