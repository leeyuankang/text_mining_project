i have only positive experience with the hotel and its personnel i like that it is a bit aside from the main touristic areas still close to the stores parks and just min walk from duomo and about min by taxi to the milano centrale station personnel was helpful room service quick as to the breakfast in comparison with usual breakfast in other italian hotels this one was good
