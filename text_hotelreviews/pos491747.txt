staff was really helpful and understanding we have a months old baby and they were always willing to help and provide whatever we needed last but not least they include and do not charge different types of coffee in breakfast the bottles of water in the mini bar and really decent wi fi shuttle bus cheaper than taxi makes you feel appreciated would definitely stay there again
