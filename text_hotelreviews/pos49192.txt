i liked the location and all other aspects of the hotel except for one thing i booked rooms and informed the hotel in advance that i need early check in but unfortunately they were reluctant to give me one room and they insisted not to deliver the other rooms unless it is p m and i was sure the rooms were clean and ready for us this was unexpected and we don t like it
