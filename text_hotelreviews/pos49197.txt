it s recently renovated so everything is very clean new and comfortable it is a perfect location within walking distance to most places i liked that the hotel communicated with me before my arrival with a list of choices such as shuttle reservation for the airport and champagne in the room etc with the prices clearly written so that i could enjoy a better experience all in all very pleased and will stay there again
