the rooms were super organized super clean and super comfortable the shower was amazing the furniture was adorable we requested interconnecting rooms and we were so thrilled to have our request honoured it is very difficult for a larger family to be accommodated with interconnecting rooms from our extensive past experience travelling with all of our daughters we felt safe cozy and relaxed our whole stay thank you
