the single room is perfect if you are just one person but the bed can be too small if you are above feet tall its decorated in a super cute and cozy way there is a cute minibar with drinks and some snacks the bathroom has all the toiletries and facilities and the breakfast is amazing it also really helps that the staff are really nice it is a minute walk to the ripamonti stop and a minute tram ride to the city centre duomo et al there are also some japanese and american restaurants nearby if you are visiting uni bocconi like i was it is a short minute walk and really couldn t be in a better location
