all staff were very helpful and genuinely pleasant all desk staff had confident english double room was clean comfy and good value for money for a fairly busy street there was no noise the mini bar wasn t as extortionate as other hotels i ve been in decent range of bars and restaurants nearby considering it s in a quieter part of central milan well priced deal for the weekend in the center of a big global city would recommend for future business or leisure travel if a similar deal was available
