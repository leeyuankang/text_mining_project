everything was perfect i will definitely go back i will kindly recommend this hotel to everybody the staff was really helpful and friendly they send us an email about what extras we would like in our room before our arrival it was a really nice gesture the room was clean everyday the bed was very comfy and the room was very cosy the breakfast was also delicious and there was lots of choice and the hotel location is perfect too
