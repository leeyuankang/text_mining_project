staff were very helpful especially in directing me to the main attractions as well as giving the best and the easiest route to get to the center by public transportation just take tram in front of the hotel and it will take you directly to the center public transportation ticket can be purchased from the receptionist for euro per day that ticket is valid for all types of public transportation also one good thing about the hotel it is not too far from san siro stadium i recommend this hotel if you plan to visit milan to attend football matches in san siro
