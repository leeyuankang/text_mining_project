we stay at this hotel only for one night but it was far beyond my expectations little bit far from the centre but with direct tram line excaclty outside of the hotel everything was nice specially the jacuzzi cabin in the toilet the room very comfortable and big very clean very generous breakfast the most importand was the value of money definately worth every euro on it on my next visit to milan definetaly it will be again my choice
