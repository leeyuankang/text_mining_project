i loved the room we were allocated it over looked the front of the hotel and allowed the sun to shine in most mornings the front desk staff were amazingly helpful and had no problem with giving us advice on where to eat drink night life along with pointing out places of interest to visit and highlighting them on a map for us we checked our rather early but the hotel had a service for holding luggage so we could come back later for it which was fantastic there is a tram line on the streets both in front and behind the hotel which brings you right into milan city center in mins its an ideal hotel for a weekend visit easy access to public transport friendly hand helpful staff classy and comfortable overall just a great hotel to stay in
