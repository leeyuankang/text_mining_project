it was a very clean tidy hotel and the staff were lovely and very friendly and helpful the room we had a triple was a very good size and clean airy and had almost everything you need the physical location was good with tram stops right opposite and a few restaurants just a short walk away breakfast buffet was quite comprehensive and had something for everyone in our opinion
