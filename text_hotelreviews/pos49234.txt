we were celebrating our anniversary during the trip and the hotel has kindly upgraded us from a standard double room to a deluxe triple room the room was renovated only last year in a modern and comfortable setting location is excellent and is only a few minutes away from madeleine station and is close by to the shops on rue du saint honore the front desk staff were mostly friendly and tried to be helpful generally it was a pleasant stay and we look forward to visiting the hotel again in our next visit to paris
