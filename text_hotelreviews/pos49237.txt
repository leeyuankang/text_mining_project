i have stayed in many hotels in paris but this is by far and away the best fabulous design job high comfort levels and attention to detail rooms not huge but best use of space and truly outstanding mini wet room staff were frankly brilliant and terrific breakfast best location in paris at a night for my modest sized room this is not a budget option but you get what you pay for in this world and in the present climate of terror attacks and air bnb competition hoteliers have to up their game this is a ten out of ten hotel and i commend the management for really delivering what discerning travelers like myself look for in a city hotel
