loved the room very clean with a very comfortable bed also the staff was very nice and eager to help there is a metro station right in front of the hotel so it s quite easy to get around although it is a bit further from the city centre than we would have liked min by metro but we knew that before we made the reservation all in all it was the perfect choice for our weekend in milano
