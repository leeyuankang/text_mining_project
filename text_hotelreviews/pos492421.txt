the room was really clean and cleaned every day the beds were very comfortable the breakfast was fresh and tasty with variety of food croissants omelette sausages with bacon fruits marmalade cakes and much more the metro station was in front of the hotel the tv had many channels some of them in english too bbc cnbc etc the wifi was free and with excellent signal quality they also provided a better speed for heavy usage if needed but i think it wasn t for free it was a great value for money for us since we booked it with discount
