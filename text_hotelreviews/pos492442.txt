the hotel is very clean and nice the metro station is just right in front of it walking distance from a mall if you d prefer to eat our rather than dining at the hotel staff were very accommodating and nice they gave us a map and showed us the best places to visit in milan we got a deluxe upgrade for only per night and the room was really fab with a walk in closet and bath free parking for genius bookers
