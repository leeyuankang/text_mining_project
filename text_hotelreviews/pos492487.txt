great location very easy to get to any place the metro staion bignami is just infront of the hotel great staff and hotel rooms we stayed a total days nights breakfast included worth every penny you realy don t need an expensive hotel in the center of milan when you got starhotel we where on christmas and new year so know that of the restaurants in milan are closed especially pizzerias but everything eles works about the same my advice is to call a restaurant via youre hotel to make sure they are realy open tripadviser is missleading
