facilities were incredible staff very helpful the view from the living room balcony was magnificent we loved how it felt like home and not an hotel there was also a dog called zeus walking around the cutest thing we had a welcome gift sent to our room and in the night you can stay in the palace living room when no one is around breakfast was really good too impressed
