quiet location in a residential area with some very good restaurants within a few minutes walk easy to reach central milan either with a ten minute metro journey or a pleasant minute walk hotel and room was very clean and having a safe was useful as was the kettle in the room along with the dressing gowns though this is only available if you get a deluxe room my wife said the cleanser provided was excellent and clean towels were provided every day
