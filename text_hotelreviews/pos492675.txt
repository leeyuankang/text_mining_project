the hotel is overall quite fine the facilities are good it s clean and the staff is prepared and professional for the price it s definitely a fine deal especially compared to other stars hotels in milan that don t deserve the ranking and are more expensive note i ve paid euros for two nights in a standard room so in general if you are looking for good service at the right price and you are not looking for a romantic gateway visconti palace is a fine choice
