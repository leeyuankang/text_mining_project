beautiful room with lovely decor great breakfast and dining room has nice views out to garden very conveniently located with easy access to metro for trips to city centre was great to have parking on site as it made travel to and from the hotel much easier than it would have been at a city centre hotel staff at reception and dining room were friendly and helpful
