i was traveling with my two young children from canada had been to several hotels across europe and italy never had anything to complain about until i got to this hotel the staff was rude super cold and loved to argue with guests i witnessed at least times the reception staff would raise voice on guests in the lobby wifi is not free please watch out they abuse guests with an overpriced wifi as a surprise item on final bill they would precharge you for the rooms then use wifi as an excuse to charge you a huge amounts before you leave the hotel got charged euros for wifi usage and they leave you with no option to dispute it i still feel i was ripped off and i intend to call my bank and dispute it so please as a friendly advice don t go to this hotel
