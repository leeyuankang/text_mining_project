the place was close to metro and if you are a bit of an adventurer like i you can walk to the duomo from this location along tree lined streets there were a couple of restaurants near enough to walk to also so that was nice we did not rent a car while in italy so the proximity to the metro and being able to walk to sights was the main appeal for this hotel it was far enough from the town center to not be as pricey or crowded with tourists and yet convenient to metro transportation
