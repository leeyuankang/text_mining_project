on arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and spacious clean modern room with everything you need and comfy beds they have a parking service so you can just drive up to the hotel and they will park your car for you by far the best breakfast we ve had in italy with lots of fresh fruit and eggs made to order lovely terrace outside for afternoon or late night drinks and the building itself is gorgeous friendly staff great wifi good restaurants and bars within walking distance about minutes walking away from milan s main square overall highly recommended
