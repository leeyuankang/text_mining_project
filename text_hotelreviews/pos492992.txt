the hotel is a lovely old building which has been restored with a nice terrace at the front the rooms are clean and pleasant if a little simple but be wary of getting a floor bedroom as this has only skylights and no window the staff were more than happy to change the room but it could be made clearer on the website the area is okay there are some reasonable restaurants and a quite lively area at night nearby but it is a little far walk to the centre trains and trams are available though
