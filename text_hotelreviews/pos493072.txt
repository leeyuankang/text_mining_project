we had a great time in the hotel it takes approximately minutes to go to the city centre duomo with the subway it s a quite area where with not that many restaurants around but there is a big supermarkt exactly next to the hotel the staff was very friendly and the hotel was looking great we will definitely come back to this hotel if we visit again
