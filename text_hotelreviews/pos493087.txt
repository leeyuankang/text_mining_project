fully staffed hotel at a good price a little off the beaten path of the hotels near the stazione centrale but with easy access to the metro and with cafes and a couple of nice local restaurants nearby as well as a full grocery next to the hotel for water and supplies comfortable rooms and a nice bar downstairs
