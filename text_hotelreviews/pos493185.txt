i ve been several times in this hotel and i can say it s every time better in terms of service quality this time the most significant improvements were with wifi internet and breakfast for the rest as always the room matter a fact an apartment was perfectly clean well suited for resting and computer working if travelling for business i appreciated also the hotel security level that allows safely leaving stuff in the room comparing with the nearby hotels in the same class i would place it on the first place as value for money
