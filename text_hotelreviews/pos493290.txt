the hotel is at a min walking distance from the line which goes straight to the dome the surroundings are perfectly safe it was beautiful even at the end of april we had some nice weather around degrees the subway stations are very short so even if you have stations to the dome you will only travel between to mins with the subway waiting time included also you can walk between a lot of the milan attractions distances are quite ok all in all it was a very pleasant stay and experience
