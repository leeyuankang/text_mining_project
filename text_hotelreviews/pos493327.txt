the location was fantastic very central and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do a supermarket about down the road which was handy for bits and pieces we loved the bar downstairs great for people watching at night time if you get there around grab a drink and then you can partake in the small buffet as well cold meats salads cheeses pasta dish pizza slices bread and vegetable sticks perfect if you don t want a huge meal just stay nibble have a couple of drinks watch the people and enjoy the music rooms were very clean and if a reasonable size staff very friendly and nothing was a bother definitely stay there again
