the hotel was modern and fresh and the staff were very helpful we preferred being slightly out of the main hustle and bustle of milan and would recommend this place to other travellers we enjoyed having a few drinks in the bar in the evening but would have liked abit of background music this hotel was also close to the tube station under min walk which was a perfect way to get in and out of the city
