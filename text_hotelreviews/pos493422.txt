the hotel is really modern and clean the staff was very kind and helpful the location is great too just a few minute walk from the bignami metro station and also from two huge shopping centres one to the south one to the north where you can buy dinner and enjoy a drink or two even though our room was right opposite the elevators there was not much noise coming from the hallway so nothing disturbed us during the night great range of sweet stuff for breakfast three types of croissants and many cakes all of them delicious
