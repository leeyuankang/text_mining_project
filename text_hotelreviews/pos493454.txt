everything except the itens reported as negative but really like this hotel if i have to go back to milan in future for sure i will stay there again the hotel employees are awesome except for the old woman of housekeeping was very rude thanks for everything ohhh and the price is very cheap in comparison with the other hotels in town but keep in mind milan is a expensive city in general
