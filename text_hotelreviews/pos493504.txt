the room was big enough and it was very well designed also decorations were very fascinating towels have been changed daily which we did not request there s a park spot across to the street which was free of charge but i wasn t sure about the security and one night i saw that there is a police car checking the neighborhood at the other hand parking to the hotel isn t so expensive per day and night the breakfast was quiet enough and delicious there is a metro line m ahead which you can reach to the center by changing just one metro line in minutes also como lake is very close we went there in minutes by car
