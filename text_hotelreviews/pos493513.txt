the hotel itself is above average nice room with modern interiors a comfortable bed and really good water pressure in the shower what was really great about the hotel was the level of customer service from the reception and bar staff we asked for extra towels and they were delivered in minutes we received great direction to all the places we wanted to see and were easily able to navigate the city on our first trip we would definitely stay with at the hotel degli arcimboldi again on our next trip to milan it s about minutes via subway from the duomo and you ll save some money from staying closer to the central downtown area
