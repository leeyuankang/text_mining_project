this property was great for a one night stay outside milan it s so easy to get the metro from this hotel about minute walk but once you get your head around the direction it s very easy polite staff clean room good mini bar bar and restaurant served until late the room itself is one of about so it s a big place we originally booked parking at the hotel but there is free on street parking just outside so if you re happy to use it that s a penny saver
