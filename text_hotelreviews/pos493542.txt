breakfast was ok rich choice of croissants and coffee was great what we also liked very much was the bed we slept as angels staff was really nice and friendly very attentive and smiling even when they had to clean tables during breakfast they all seem really nice and polite location was quite ok in a peaceful environment no traffic sounds
