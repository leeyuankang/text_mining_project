i have been here several times last time in march and april i will here focus on what has happened since last time reception staff is more friendly and the security guard mentioned earlier has been replaced with a more friendly looking man the hotel uses now a couple of security men but why in the restaurant at breakfast time one was standing looking at all guests enjoying their breakfast a little difficult with security men looking at you never seen that before at other hotels good breakfast and kind and friendly waiters i had only one night to stay but i had some preferences about room and floor i had in advance told the hotel about it but i had to say it again when i arrived i came at a little bad time because a guest who was leaving the hotel was very angry and let all hear about it the receptionist told me it was of course not normal and excused the scene i agree if a guest has a problem tell the reception staff about it and get a solution i got what i had asked for when telling about my preferences the rooms are very nice and i really like the design of light in the rooms however be aware about if it works or not in my room several spot s were gone being there only one night i would not make anything about it just telling the staff in the morning they had to be changed it is good that it is now possible to get something to drink in the bar until midnight that was not possible before however this is a four star hotel and if you have a bar why not sell the most common drinks and have some good wines to it could be much better my conclusion is however if you get a good discount you get a very comfy room with a good bed i would like a lounge area very much for the time being the hotel is more like a star hotel
