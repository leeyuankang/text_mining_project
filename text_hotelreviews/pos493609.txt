i liked that hotel very clean and modern cozy rooms delicious breakfast friendly stuff wifi works great good location just minutes from metro or bus station value this money it is not easy to find such an awesome place to stay in milan with really cheap price for this city i was choosing between this hotel and hotels near milano centrale they were old and pure but for the same price i am happy that i chosen this one because it is really easy and quick to get to all beautiful places from here and you can even use a tram at night recommend
