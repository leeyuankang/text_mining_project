nice hotel clean and comfortable rooms with blackout curtains they have a really good breakfast and the hotel is a handy two minutes walk from the metro station and minutes to the centre of milan the hotel gives the impression it s a luxury hotel but it is more like a high end ibis or something like that which is not a bad thing i enjoyed my stay
