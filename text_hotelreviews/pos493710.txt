the location was really good the nearest metro was about mins away on foot the line the metro is on if taken all the way will take you to san siro the other lines were not hard to switch over too either staff were really friendly and were enthusiastic to help out and provide any information required the room was beautiful although the window view wasn t of much they screened the finals of the euros in the breakfast area as well
