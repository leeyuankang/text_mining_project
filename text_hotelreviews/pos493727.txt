good staff location is away from city centre about miles but you have metro about meters away from hostel and you need to change two trains to be in the city centre or you can walk and take another train and be in the city centre both route takes about minutes price is reasonable if you are with kids or family i will recommend to find the hotel close to city centre staff always helpful environment was great room was cozy and comfortable but slightly smaller as compared to other starts we have twin bed room air con system was perfect
