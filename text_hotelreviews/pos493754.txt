i frequently come to milano and instead of booking different hotels i like to have a place feeling like home a hotel with good standard competitive prices and first and foremost good service and a welcome attitude from the staff i have been at this hotel also in marth and now again here in april from of april you can see my first recommendation written of april concerning my stay in marth this time i was here days plus that is why i make my recommendation after the last day be aware about the prices per night monday is very expensive compared with weekends and fridays as mentioned in my first recommendation the rooms are very nice good bed and bathroom modern and nice designed also the electric light good cleaning and nice cleaning staff breakfast is also very good and in my opinion you cannot complain about that i cannot tell you about the dinner at the hotel at that time i am in town when i booked a room this time i had of course some preferences about floor number view and kind of room i got what i had asked for and many thanks for that that is good service unfortunately the safe box was out of order but talking with the reception staff they send at man to fix the problem at once no delay that is very good service all waiters during my stay very friendly and some remembered me from the month before some of the reception staff are very friendly and helpful if you want a nice room good breakfast and competitive prices and you do not stay at the hotel during the day or in the area because you want to go to the center of milan this is in fact a good hotel that is why i will come back again location just min from metro bignami it takes about min to the center of milan be aware that this will stop about midnight if you are in town late you have to take bus and tram tram stops next to m bignami
