clean hotel great staff congrats for their manager trainer they were always smiling an example about how staff should look like good breakfast many choices and a surprise decent coffee a mister for me is why olives are missing from the breakfast in an italian hotel surprisingly good wifi service perfect whatsapp call clarity and decent quality of the voip calls very good value for money i paid app euro night per room people and i think that it s one of the best prices you can find in milano the hotel is in a safe area m from the hotel is a mall and ther you can see football games as a conclusion i recommend this hotel to people who are not travelling with children distance to the main tourist attractions could be a problem for young sleepy children less than years old
