very nice rooms colorfull and modern special light design good bed and bathroom cleaning staff very nice smiling and helpfull breakfast very good waiters fine but you are to hurry about start up cleaning at telling people to hurry up and remove food sharp is in my opinion a mistake however good value for money near metro bringing you everywhere i had a problem with the minibar it could not cool down the water however they gave me another room at once i think they do their best solving problems and i will return as long as they are competitive value for me is first and foremost service and a nice staff feeling welcome
