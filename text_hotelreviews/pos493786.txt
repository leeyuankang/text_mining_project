the hotel is very new and modern the rooms are very nice with a great bathroom with shower bidet and towel warmer breakfast is delicious with great variety of pastries fruit cold cuts and cheeses there is also eggs and bacon but that s likely aimed at the north american traveler in honesty that wasn t the best part of breakfast the location is in a less desirable area of milan but it is a minute walk to the metro stop transit connections are fine there are restaurants and shopping in the area as well as teatro degli arcimboldi for concerts and events
