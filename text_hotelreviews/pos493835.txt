we stayed for night at this hotel and was really good value for money the hotel is in the north part of milan city centre but you can go easily with metro to the centre in about min the room was clean really quite with a confortable bed and nice light the breakfast was good with fresh food with a good italian coffee and a good service we paid euro a night for a private parking that is a really good value in milan we will back again in this good hotel
