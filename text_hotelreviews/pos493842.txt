booked the hotel for a night out at the arcimboldi theatre which is walking distance the room was very nice and clean service was poor at breakfast and at the bar we went for a drink in the evening and waited for some time then waitress acknowledged us so we thought we d be tended soon so waited longer but nothing happened and we decided to leave the bar wasn t that busy but there was only one waitress on a saturday night in a milan full of events breakfast was of an extremely low quality for a stars hotel however i d recommend it and would go again since breakfast is not what i look for when in milan just take the metro find yourself in town and there will be thousands of nice cafes
