i had narrowed my search by the proximity to the airport and the availability of a shuttle this hotel provided neither it was km from the airport and did not provide a shuttle i had to pay the taxi euros to get to the hotel the website was very misleading the night staff was not very helpful shower broke down halfway which was a very unpleasant experience
