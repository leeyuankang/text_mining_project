a very clean and comfortable room helpful staff good breakfast facilities and open pretty long so no need to get up that early for those that care wifi was fast and tv was nice with access to a lot of channels the hotel is located in an area where it seems there isn t much to do but it was very close to a subway line to the city very convenient
