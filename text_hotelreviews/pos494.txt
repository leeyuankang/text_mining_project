this is the second k k hotel i stayed at the other was in barcelona it s a great boutique hotel the hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside you re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for london would definitely stay here again
