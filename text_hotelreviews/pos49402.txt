the genuine warmth and friendliness of the staff from the moment we arrived was a delight and much better than experienced at larger hotels we received an early check in with a lovely room overlooking the courtyard and assistance with printing tickets as well as a late light dinner one evening the breakfast in the cave each morning was perfect and a great uniquely french and intimate atmosphere the location is also great walking distance to metro stations and musee d orsay notre dame and the latin quarter would definitely stay here again
