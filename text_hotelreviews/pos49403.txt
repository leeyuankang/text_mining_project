the hotel is located in close proximity to many of the top attraction which are walkable we used an uber to visit the the eiffel tower and getting a car was easy and cost effective the hotel has a c which was a necessity because of the temperatures during our visit our room had access to the floor patio so that made the stay extra special staff was friendly and knew english well enough to help us every time we had questions
