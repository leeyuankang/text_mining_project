i really enjoyed my nights stay at st george hotel location is really good close to the grand central station and republica square so you can even walk from airport shuttle bus drop location central station or take a taxi from central station to the hotel for up to euros if you have a lot if suit cases metro station p ta venezia is really near to the hotel which can get you wherever you want in milan but it is also very close to duomo and other sites if you like to walk breakfast was excellent nice spread not only sweet breakfast as you can often see in italy but full spread scrambled eggs hams cheese etc staff was really helpful and pleasant we stayed for labor day holidays so we asked receptionist stefano to help us understand if some locations were working or not and he called them for us and was generally very helpful same as other members of the staff probably as part of genius booking status we came an hour earlier before usual check in and were able to check in immediately i sent this note to hotel in advance via booking as well i would definitely recommend it and stay there again when in milan
