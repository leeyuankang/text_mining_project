the triple room was in fact a suite with a king size bed solid comfortable sofa bed dressing room and bathroom with a bath decor was surprisingly fresh and modern and the room was spacious breakfast was good value and afternoon tea is on offer each day which unfortunately we were not around to try staff were extremely helpful and very nice top marks to all of them their restaurant recommendation at mamma rosa was just perfect for us and a highlight of our european trip
