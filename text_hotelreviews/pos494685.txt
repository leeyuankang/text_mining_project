warm welcome from staff on reception and throughout entire stay always willing to talk to guests and assist in anyway they could a credit to the hotel location was perfect close to central station min and a short stroll to the nearest metro stop venezia which makes getting round milan a lot easier although you could walk to the centre duomo in minutes would stay at this hotel again and would certainly recommend the only slight negative i can give on the hotel is the size of the shower which was rather small but that s being really picky
