the staff were so welcoming from the minute we walked in the door and they were very friendly for the duration of our stay i haven t one bad thing to say about this hotel with great location as the metro is only a walk around the corner and only two stops from the main square but if you wish to walk it s only minutes and the staff provided easy directions and a map to help i really enjoyed our stay here and certainly recommend it
