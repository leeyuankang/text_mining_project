i ve stayed here times i found the rooms to be inconsistent superior rooms have a washing seat where you wash yourself after using the toilet the location is great close enough to museums boat rides shopping centers it s really central it s the main reason i return to this hotel parking is available driving a car in amsterdam is a nightmare close to good restaurants if you get hungry midnight
