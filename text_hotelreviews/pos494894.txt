there were of us and we had the three lovely big rooms at the front of the hotel i had the the verdi suite the rooms are clean and the bed was excellent however the rooms could do with a refurbishment and modernising the staff were very very helpful polite and efficient brilliant location easy to get tram from the main station and stopped right outside the hotel very close walking distance to dam square and all the other amsterdam city sights would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again
