room was clean and tidy very comfy bed had an amazing view from floor balcony overlooking the amazing awesome amsterdam sites tea and coffee in room too good value for money hotel in good location just mins walk from train station and everything was close by red light district is an eye opener warm waffles topped with so much toppings are a must they are to die for look around though if you pop into any supermarkets as some don t put any prices and you end up paying euros for a small bottle water and bag of crisps ridiculous watch out for the bikes lol not much traffic which is nice but the bikes are everywhere and just come out of nowhere think they have priority over everything lol oh and if you re trying to find the iamsterdam block as we were it s next to the van gogh museum which is worth a visit too take an hour canal ride too didn t cost much and was very pleasant we only stayed for nights and couldn t fit in all we wanted to do would love to go back but in warmer months as it was cold and had sleet on last day brrrr
