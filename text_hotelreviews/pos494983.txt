i booked the trip as it was my boyfriends birthday i booked a standard room but emailed the hotel to ask if they could do something special with it explained it was my boyfriends i just thought we d get a complimentary bottle of wine or something along those lines when we arrived the hotel had upgraded our room free of charge to a superior room which had a small balcony with an amazing view the room was perfect the bed was extremely comfy also when we arrived back to the hotel room later that night we had a bottle of wine a plate of goodies waiting for us to with a card wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday it was excellent would definitely recommend
