this place was just south of the city center i loved its location was walkable right next to many shops and restaurants what was even better was at night the neighborhood was relatively quiet but it was a short walk to all the nightlife amsterdam has to offer also they lock the doors after hours and you have to be buzzed in so it was nice knowing they have extra security
