with the exception of a very slight hiccup at registration our stay nh carlton was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful helped with printing tickets and highlighting popular attractions and the room was a good size with balconies ask for room best balconies by far it was my birthday whilst we were away and the hotel picked up on this and left a card and gift in the room for me
