breakfast was served in a very pleasant room and everything offered was tasty and high quality i have seen more variety on offer at some paris hotels but i felt that i had a good breakfast and enjoyed it this hotel is particularly convenient if you are travelling onwards to the south west from montparnasse until the end of may be aware that the metro from gare du nord cannot stop here and it s a fairly expensive taxi ride you see lots of paris en route
