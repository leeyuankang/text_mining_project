early response from staff was not satisfying but upon my comments it was satisfactory in fact my wife developed a medical condition on our last night and night staff at front office was extremely extremely supportive capably handled the medical support much appreciated my request for late check out due to my wife s health was also accommodated without charge by amey who provided all necessary information about local pharmacies and translation to get some medicines grateful indeed
