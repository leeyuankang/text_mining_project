i have travelled the world and stayed at a great many hotels but i have to say that the staff at hotel le six are the best i have ever encountered slimane was particularly helpful throughout our stay what a great team the hotel with an interior which looks fresh and new is very nicely decorated and furnished to make for a very comfortable stay our deluxe room with a juliet balcony was simply superb thank you so much i would absolutely recommend staying here if you are visiting paris
