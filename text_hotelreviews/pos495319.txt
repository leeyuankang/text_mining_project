we had a slight issue with our booking where our credit and debit cards weren t working but laura at the reception was extremely patient suggested ideas and waited till we figured out what to do she even ended up giving us a room upgrade for our troubles that room was lovely probably the largest we saw in amsterdam we were so delighted had a wonderful stay the location is great too right next to the blomenmarkt the stunning flower market
