had a lovely stay here staff helpful and friendly and always willing to help advice breakfast lovely with lots of fresh fruit bread juices meats etc etc the toiletries provided are of great quality and i was pleased to see there was the usual soap shampoo conditioner shower gel body lotion and also hand cream wifi was free and worked really well and the location of the hotel was easy to reach with a number of metro lines but being situated on a smaller side road off the main boulevard one couldn t hear all the busy traffic would happily stay here again
