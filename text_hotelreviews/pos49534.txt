le six is clean and provides relatively large rooms the location is great there are numerous restaurants close by however i suggest to stay away from restaurants off the main street as they are expensive it was overall a great experience the staff went out of their way to provide helpful services such as travel from and to the airport reservations at restaurants and good information regarding local attractions
