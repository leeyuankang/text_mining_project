the quaint historic nature of the hotel makes it worth staying here it s also next door to the underground station so it s super convenient to hop on the rail and get wherever you re going every corner near this hotel has a restaurant or retail location so there is a lot to do in the neighborhood and i felt very safe and comfortable i booked a single room which was very clean and nicely laid out but it was the size of a very small bedroom smaller than i believe i am a big guy so it was a little hard to get around with the bed and desk and chair and table on the wall i booked online so i didn t realize how small the room was had i known how small i would have upgraded to a bigger room but after a day of travelling and arriving in my room with all my luggage i was just too tired to bother there was a doorman there with a red bowler hat that was a bit of a character and very helpful someone greeted me at the door and took my bags to my room so i didn t have to worry about that
