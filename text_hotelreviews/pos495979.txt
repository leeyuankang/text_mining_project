the staff was very helpful and tried to fix what they could and booked museum tickets airport transfer and bikes as requested location was very central near the floating flower market and museum distrinct and walking distance to many things bikes rented are speed with hand brakes some places only offer speed and peddle brakes room was clean albeit very small
