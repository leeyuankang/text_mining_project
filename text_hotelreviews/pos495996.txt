the staff were very helpful the hotel was very busy but boy do the staff deal with it well the mattress was firm which was great for me the room had complimentary coffee and water i m a tea drinker but my friend enjoyed the coffee the location was good right next to the flower market and there are a great couple of cafe s around there too i would say it s away from the main hub enough that you don t have to put up with hens stags making lots of noise the hotel and facilities are stylish but small the hotel has no air con so they provide fans which are very powerful
