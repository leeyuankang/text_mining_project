i love the interior design as soon as you enter the reception area you feel relaxed and happy room layout is very convenient the room size was big and the nespresso machine was a nice touch everything you need is the room lighting is very good too not too dark and not annoyingly bright just perfect large spacious bathroom with a good shower and large bathtub great food from the room service menu gourmet cheeses and large delicious burgers
