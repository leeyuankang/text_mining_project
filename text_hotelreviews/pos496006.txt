we stayed in the studio apartment and it was great it was extremely spacious and clean and it was great having the washing machine and dryer in the room we were halfway through our holiday so it was good being able to do a quick load of washing so we could have fresh clothes for the rest of the trip the location is also excellent it was within walking distance of lots of tourist attractions shops and restaurants the staff were very friendly and helpful the studio apartment is located up two flights of very steep narrow stairs which was fine for us but might be problematic for some people but the staff helped us carry our bags i would highly recommend staying here
