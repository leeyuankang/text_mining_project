we had a lovely stay at the albus hotel the staff are so friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived we had a lovely room on the floor with views of the city the bathroom was of a good size with walk in shower the bed was big and comfy the hotel is in a great location right next to rembrandt square which is great for restaurants and nightlife and we were within walking distance of all good attractions all in all this hotel is great we had a lovely weekend break and will definitely be returning to the albus hotel
