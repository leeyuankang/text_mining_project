the location was superb a minute walk from the national history museum and amongst some handy shops and nice restaurants the staff in the morning as we handed back our key were really friendly and helpful especially the doorman we were able to leave our luggage as we weren t catching a train until later in the day which was great room wise i imagine it was bigger than most classic double rooms in the area so having a little extra space even for one night was great the room and details were also lovely there was a nice selection of toiletries fluffy towels bottles of water biscuits and a good size tv
