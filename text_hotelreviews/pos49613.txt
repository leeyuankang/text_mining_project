the hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent the underground is just across the hotel doors and three different train lines run through it but what truly makes the bailey s hotel special is the unparalleled service of its friendly accommodating and professional staff they truly made my stay comfortable and special would definitely stay here every time i m in london
