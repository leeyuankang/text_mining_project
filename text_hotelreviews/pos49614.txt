you will be hard pushed to find a better location in london the baileys hotel lives upon to its rating and you are made to feel welcome from the moment you arrive the classic room we had was a little smaller than we expected and had no armchair but was spotlessly clean and the facilities particularly a great shower were first class breakfast was the best we have experienced in london with quality food well cooked and hot all of the staff were extremely helpful efficient and friendly
