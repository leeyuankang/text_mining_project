all the staff was extremely friendly and helpful too we were given a kettle for our room after we asked for one as we like a cuppa early in the morning and this did not stop us from enjoying our afternoon tea downstairs by the bar which has very reasonable prices we ll be back for sure as the hotel is very central near metro placa espanya
