we arrived very early from our cruise ship but this was not a problem and we were given our room straight away the staff at reception were wonderful and very helpful the rooms were modern but the bathroom whilst looked good wasn t very practical clear sink the door to the bathroom wasn t sound proof and the fan in the bathroom didn t work so steamy mirror but shower was lovely and powerful
