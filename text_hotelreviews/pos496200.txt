we would definitely request a room with an outside view should we visit this hotel again our room was very small and our window faced the tiny courtyard which looked straight into the lift area so we could not open the curtains the bathroom was also tiny but at least they did squeeze in a bath which is great the location of this hotel is close to the plaza de espana which includes the arena shopping centre and within walking distance of the train station and airport bus staff were very helpful there was no safe in the room but a lockup safe provided with own access near the reception the price was very reasonable compared to other hotels we stayed in
