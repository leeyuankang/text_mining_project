all in all it was a very nice hotel the two lady staff were very welcoming and friendly the rooms were small clean and perfect with everything we needed for a short stay we stayed for nights there was a tiny gym which my husband used which was really handy and a sauna which we could have used for free oh yes the see through glass sink in the bathroom was really beautiful the location of this hotel was great mins to nearest metro station and main shopping area also great for the airport bus this is the third hotel in this area we have stayed in all have been really great but this was the smallest room and the most expensive we would stay again at a drop of a hat but maybe wait for a good deal on the price next time thank you for a lovely stay
