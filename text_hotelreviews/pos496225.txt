location off the plaza espana was great only downside was there was a lot of noise when the window was open but closed was fine right by the metro and fdg to the fira europa minute walk to the plaza catalunya and las ramblas staff helpful and room service and breakfast good room and bed comfortable and lots of hot water in the shower
