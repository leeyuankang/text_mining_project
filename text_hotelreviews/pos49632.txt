the hotel is located right next to gloucester road tube station and situated in a really great area for bars restaurants shops coffee shops and only minutes walk away from south kensington high street and the museums the staff were all extremely friendly efficient and nothing seemed too much trouble the concierge doorman was very elegant in his tweeds and red bowler hat very chatty and knowledgeable about the area and london in general the hotel had complimentary newspapers water tea and coffee everyday in our room and they also stored our bags free of charge when we checked out as our flight wasn t until later in the day all in all the hotel was excellent value for money located in an absolutely great place and i would certainly stay again and recommend anyone planning on staying in london to give this hotel a try
