i have reviewed this hotel previously as i was in and out of this little gem several times over my week visit to spain i spent a total of nights at the vilana it was close to my daughter s dorm and was very convenient for me the staff was wonderful friendly and helpful i stayed in three different rooms and each one had a nice view especially room lots of electrical outlets a little refrigerator hair dryer robe and slippers comfy beds and pillows this isn t a posh hotel but i rated it as excellent because it is clean and comfortable and exactly what i was looking for the hotel is in a beautiful and safe residential neighborhood but close to restaurants banks shops and markets it is a ten minute walk to metro and minutes on metro to pla a catalunya the hub of barcelona the bus runs along bonanova which is a half block away i enjoyed getting away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas at the end of the day to the peace and quiet of the vilana neighborhood airport cab fare was approximately each way fares to most popular venues my daughter and i visited was but i usually took metro also convenient for those needing to be near teknon hospital i thoroughly enjoyed the vilana
