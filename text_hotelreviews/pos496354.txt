i really liked the location of the hotel even though it is situated away from the city centre the neighbourhood is one of the best in barcelona classy quiet and clean but there are also quite a few restaurants bakeries and stores close by also the bed linen and the towels had a very nice small which is a bit rare in most hotels the room size was very good as well
