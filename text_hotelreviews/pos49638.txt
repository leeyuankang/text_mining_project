i liked the main hall therefore there are very friendly and kindly staff it s really close to the underground station gloucester where you can arrive with a few couple of stops in piccadilly circus you can reach harrods minutes on foot kensington gardens hyde park and royal albert hall just by walk and it s very close the natural historic museum therefore if u wanna have a good breakfast you can take something in the best boulangerie called paul in the opposite side of the hotel to sum up i really enjoyed my stay here and i wanna recommend this hotel if i come back in london i ll stay here for sure
