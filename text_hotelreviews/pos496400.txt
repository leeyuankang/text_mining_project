loved the size smallish boutique like hotel with large doubles easy walking distance to the action and airport city bus in a midtown neighbourhood with good restaurants and real tapis bars filled with locals not tourists front desk staff were very helpful at all hours requests were met with friendly responses and assistance especially appreciated their effort to get us to the airport on time when the taxis went on strike as my spanish is bad being able to communicate in english good breakfast buffet it was quiet at night
