i overall loved the hotel and the location the room was a very good size with a comfortable king size bed and view of the main street there was no noise problem the wifi worked very well the housekeeping was superb i loved the bathroom with the separate tub and shower set up there was climate control in the room there was a tiny refrigerator with mini bar items that had just enough space for additional items the location was excellent being three block from the urgell metro station there are also a variety of international cuisines to choose from within a block or two away i would highly recommend this hotel because it was definitely the best deal i could find in barcelona especially in eixample happy travels
