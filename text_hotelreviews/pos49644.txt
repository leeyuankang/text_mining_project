conveniently located to the underground and paul patisserie i loved the old world feel of the entrance and the grand staircase my room was charming and quiet comfortable bed and large bathroom i liked the little vignette of art on the wall the products used in the bathroom were really nice and the little lights above the bed were lovely for reading there was never a wait for the lift either
