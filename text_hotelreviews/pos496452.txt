the facilities were fab the spa was open until which is great when you have been on your feet all day although it is small so if it was busy then that would of been a issue and more lighting should be thought about especially by the stairs to the whirlpool as they are not lit at all and sign for the step into the steam room rubber mats should also be considered for the floor when wet as very slippery could not complain about the room very comfortable and excellent size would return helpful staff from the city centre
