the staff was very helpful initially we were given a room which was attached to the bedroom of the next room and our son was poorly on the first day so he was noisy the first day our neighbours didn t like this and came to us to complain we immediately reported it and were given another room by the staff later that day the staff made it clear that our neighbours had no right to complain to us directly and should have contacted them in the first place they also said that they have a policy to not give such room to families with young children but something went wrong in the booking process the breakfast was also excellent
