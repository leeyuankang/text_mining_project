after we walked away from a disappointing air bnb we made a spur of the moment decision to book this hotel the rooms were very clean and fresh which was our priority our first room became very noisy due to some men and machines working in the street outside but there was no problem to move us to a quieter room staff were excellent to help us in any way we mainly eat out but had breakfast at the hotel on our departure day and this was very acceptable we used the gym and spa which we had to ourselves we had hoped to stay in the gothic area but even though this hotel looked to be more than walking distance to the centre a bus stop opposite the reception meant we could be there in minutes all buses are frequent and traffic flows well with multi lanes operating in one way systems there are no great room views but as a base we couldn t fault our stay i will return again with no concerns
