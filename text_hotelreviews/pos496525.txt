we were siblings on a xmas break ages the location was good it gave us a chance to tour like a tourist without a tour guide the metro s were about a walk on either sides of the hotel depending where you were going everything is more or less self explanatory if you have used a tube before everything was colour co ordinated the staff were very very helpful even on xmas day they were still smiling always ready to help and they spoke good english too on our last night we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant and the food was very nice good portion and great value for money
