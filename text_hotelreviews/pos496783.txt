nice property overall but the first night i was placed in a basement room with a tiny window less than during a heat wave there was a door to the courtyard but as a woman alone i couldn t leave that open i couldn t breathe and slept not a wink there was scaffolding outside my room the windows were dirty and construction started at on top of it the room was the smallest room i have ever been in the shower so small that it was impossible to get into it without flooding the floor for this i paid euro when i spoke to them in the morning they agreed to move me and offered me a free coffee they seemed not surprised so i suspect this happens a lot though this room should never be rented very disappointing behavior despite the fact that my second room was fine i would not return
