excellent location not only close to the tram bus station but also near leidseplein where lots of restaurants located minute walk to rijksmuseum and van gogh museum around tram stops to get to the centraal station hours to get to giethoorn and minutes away from zaanse schans the food was okay breakfast is in buffet style the staff was friendly in general the room i got was under the first floor but it s unlike a basement since there s an open outdoor area where i could still go out from my room
