the restaurant was excellent both for breakfast and for dinner the staff is always kind and smiling the hotel in general is very well furnished the ambient is warm and make you feel comfortable my room was claimed as a small one i had to change the dates at the very last second and i could not find a normal one actually for one person i was travelling for business that was perfectly fine and a bit cheaper as well the location is excellent walking distance from city center and few steps from the bus stop to the airport and right behind van gogh museum the room and bathroom were very clean and the towels changed every day even if not required
