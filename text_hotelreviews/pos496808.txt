we loved the rain shower head great bathroom and very clean and fresh our beds and pillows were comfortable great storage in closet three of us felt like there was plenty of space and beautiful high ceilings furnishings were functional and interiors smart the neighborhood was absolutely lovely totally accessible to public transportation on a very quiet street beautiful surroundings close to restaurants and museums and a great market a walk around the block we would return to stay again for sure loved that there was a fridge in the room as well as a tea pot to make tea or instant coffee in the morning
