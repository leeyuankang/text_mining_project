extra friendly and welcoming staff they took the time to show us on a map what to do in amsterdam the different areas etc we also had something we asked for for the room and they arranged it in minutes before arriving i send an email with some special requirements and they answered in the hour and all was right when arriving great location near everything but still not in a crowdy or touristic street very pleased with our stay
