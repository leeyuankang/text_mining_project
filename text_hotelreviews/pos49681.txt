excellent location right at the door of the gloucester road tube station zone so it makes it so easy to access all london has to offer via the underground also a tesco pub right across the street so easy to pick up supplies and grab a quick pint after a hard day sightseeing the staff were very accommodating the rooms are on the smaller side but this is standard for london onsite restaurant bar olives is nice and convenient
