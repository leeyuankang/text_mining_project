our room night was in the basement which i was uncomfortable with the bed was really comfy if your like me you need to state this at the time of booking as it a standard room but the staff very kindly moved us into a suite upstairs as it was our anniversary they gave us a bottle of wine we dined in the joost restaurant they gave us glasses of cava lovely the dinner was a dutch meal very nice the staff were so nice friendly very helpful made us very welcome the hotel is so central unlike here the public transport was brill we loved it would stay there again just because of the staff
