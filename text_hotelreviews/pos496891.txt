the staff was very friendly and helpful the location is great i did not want to stay in the central part of town so this was perfect for me only few minutes away from leidseplein where we took the tram and we would be in the central in minutes we had breakfast once at the hotel and it was almost euros it is good value if you eat alot but i thought it was too much for couple of croissant and a cup of coffee we had fresh sheets and towels daily except for the second last day which was annoying we had a small double room and although its small it is actually really good size with a nice bathroom and a tv i recommend this hotel to everyone and i really loved the location and how nice the hotel looked
