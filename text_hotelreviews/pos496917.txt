this hotel was a good value for the price the area is far enough from the city center to avoid the party crowd but close enough to the better restaurants i read a bunch of reviews before booking this place and some complained about noise in the basement rooms which has i fully understand now because i passed by those rooms numerous times and can imagine how annoying that would be if i was on the bottom floor bottom line book this place if you re not a ground level the rooms types let you choose
