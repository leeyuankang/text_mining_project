we were upgraded to the deluxe bedroom apartment right on the prinsengracht canal the view was amazing it was beautifully decorated immaculately clean and in the perfect location the hotel vondel staff were never more than a phone call away and helped out on more than one occasion with a taxi and other random questions we had i would definitely stay here again and hope to do so in the near future
