the bed was lovely i like crisp cotton sheets and fat pillows it was unexpectedly high so you literally had to climb in but nevertheless fine the room was cleaned and the bed made every day when we were out excellent choice for breakfast which was included in our price euros would have been a bit steep otherwise smallish room but adequate also nice double shower with good temp and pressure minifridge handy for storing snacks and milk safe also a bonus
