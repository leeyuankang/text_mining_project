while booking i told them that it will be the first time i ll go to amsterdam with my partner and that it will be very nice to have a special romantic ambiance in our room when we ll arrive and i wasn t disappointed the hotel is very well located very near the museum quarter and leidseplein the style of the hotel is very nice
