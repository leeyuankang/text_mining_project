the reception staff was absolutely wonderful helpful and friendly to the max they upgraded our room at no extra cost when they found out it was my partner s birthday and they sent us a bottle of wine from our home country to enjoy such attention to detail at a very affordable rate the hotel s decor is super trendy and well thought out and creates an amazing atmosphere we were overall very very pleased
