chic hotel tucked away in a small street near a busy vibrant area i liked the hotel it was nice but has the potential to be great we had a few issues with our room in the beginning but the staff sorted it straight away we booked the junior sweet but it had two single beds we changed rooms immediately to a much nicer room and of a higher standard overall the staff were very helpful food was good
