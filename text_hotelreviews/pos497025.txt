the jr suite was just beautiful the only thing that was missing was a microwave the bathroom had heated floors and very modern this hotel is in the perfect spot far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy area but yet close enough to walk to the trams which take you throughout the city definitely one of the best boutique hotels in the area the staff was just great would stay there again
