fantastic location right outside gloucester road tube station it was about a twelve minute walk to the royal albert hall where we were going there is an outstanding italian restaurant in the hotel book well in advance it was heaving but the atmosphere was great the staff are totally professional but very friendly with it we will definitely stay here again
