great place to stay in terms of comfort we found everything as expected the hotel is atmospheric and full of lively guests bustling around the busy bar and restaurant downstairs which in my experience is always nice to see even if you don t want to join in the location is great for those who want to visit the v a the science and natural history museum and knightsbridge is a short walk from there the tube station is literally opposite nice market stool selling fruit outside so incredibly handy if you re traveling to and from heathrow as it is on the picadilly line no changes
