we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in may admitting it is a budget business hotel our experience exceeded that we asked for a quiet room on an upper floor facing away from the street they gave us exactly that top floor facing the rear with a large dormer for our window which gave the room a real design effect very large room and bath quiet all the staff was not only competent but personable we arrived late on a tuesday in late may and there was plenty of secure parking in the basement by thursday night car spaces were few very nice breakfast easy to get to and leave by car not counting vienna s highways very close access to the underground thus to the city center
