we loved the opulent atmosphere at the bailey s hotel the hotel itself is beautiful with lovely and very accommodating staff it s directly opposite the gloucester road tube station and across the road from a tesco express a pret a manger a burger king and a kfc the surroundings do not detract from the beauty of the hotel and we were not once aware of or disturbed by the outside noise we would recommend this hotel to anyone as it was far beyond our expectations and is an incredible value for money for any other hotel with such high ratings a two night stay was almost twice the price or inconveniently located a wonderful stay
