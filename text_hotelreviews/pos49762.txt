excellent hotel check in with kim was extremely pleasant and easy upgraded to room bit of a cliche but worth the laugh we had at check in room was clean and spacious everything as expected and location next to gloucester rd tube was a bonus will definitely request to stay again made the business trip that extra bit special thanks millenium bailey s
