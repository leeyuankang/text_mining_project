air condition was not working at all we did not sleep for nights as it was too hot staff was very polite and helpful though they did all they can and also gave us a fan from the lobby in our room i understand that these places have rains and winters most of the time of the year but not any more due to global warming the climate across the globe is changing and keeping that n mind they need to boost their air conditioners we changed a few rooms but then understoood that the air condition strength was not as per the requirement of the climate
