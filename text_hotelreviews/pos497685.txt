during our stay we had contact to three different employees at the check in desk and two employees at the bar all of of them where very friendly without any exception when we checked in ms wilson offered us an upgrade of per night a good deal which she sold well to us and was worth the money very good beds with quality matresses nice and clean bathroom had a room on the floor perfect view quiet it is of course always an advantage to have a room on a higher level it s the better rooms and the noise level is reduced street in addition there is a coffe machine with capsules in such rooms which i found very comfortable one thing you might won t like is that the furniture is not brand new but please if anything else is ok you have to overlook certain things so dont expect modern brand new rooms but you can and should expect clean and good equiped room room with as little marks an spots on walls and furniture as possible in our room that was the fact so you might consider an upgrade as well the room had a decent size behind the hotel there is public parking space for free the tube is very close approx around the corner all together we found the hotel worth the four stars
