the hotel was perfect for a business trip that i had for one day in vienna i ve chosen this hotel due to its proximity to the office where i had the meeting minute to walk in between the room was very generous which i liked very much i m not feeling comfortable when some space constraints occur my staying i had the room at floor so the windows are not free to be widely opened it s common approach in order to prevent accidental falls from window or balcony met in many countries the air conditioner was functioning when i entered into the room very nice gesture given that the outside temperature was around c everything was shines cleaning the bathroom very spacious also equipped with all the necessary consumables in the morning i had a good breakfast buffet style
