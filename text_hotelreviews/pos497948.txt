the bed was really comfy and my room was clean and big it s not in the city centre but there is a subway close by that takes you there in like min the breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful and friendly i was there for a conference in the vienna centre and for that it was an excellent location just a minute walk there was a huge shopping center just stops away with the subway so you dont have to go far to get stuff
