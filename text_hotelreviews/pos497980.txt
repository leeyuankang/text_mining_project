location is somewhere in the middle of the city so it was quite convenient to get to both ends for business outside of the city and leisure down town a direct shuttle bus from the airport right to the hotel door was definitely a big advantage a pleasant surprise were apples left in the room on daily basis breakfast was very good with big variety of choices in a cosy environment of the restaurant escalator was always available though there were many guests
