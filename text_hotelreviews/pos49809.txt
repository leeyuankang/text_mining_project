location was excellent right outside the tube station although it was in a central location it was still very quiet in our room overlooks the main street cafe opposite we could see from our window zacks amazing breakfast and lunch for relatively cheap for london room was good size don t know why people on here have moaned about bathroom size yes it wasn t massive but who spends their whole trip in the bathroom staff were brilliant in bringing up more tea and milk etc when we requested it didn t use the bar but looked nice if you sign up to a newsletter things wifi is free bit odd considering everywhere is free wifi now but not a problem excellent location and good price for two nights considering its london
