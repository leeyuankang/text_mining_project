a nice hotel that is situated slightly off the grid close to the main shoppingstreet thats true but at the end of it that is quite far from the very city center it is at least min walk to the main attractions but subway and buses are close the interior is slightly worn down but my room was comfy and surprisingly big very efficient ac which was nice when it was around celcius outdoors i had booked parking in advance so i got room but there were others who had problems with that it had a good price value combo for what i paid but it is rather overacclaimed in the text about it on booking com it is a standard star hotel off the grid with friendly staff and a boring breakfast room with nice buffet
