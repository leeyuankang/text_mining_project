the hotel is in a very good location off mariahilfer the breakfast was excellent and the hotel is very clean throughout yet i made the error of booking a single room which came with a wobbly single bed i did complain about it but nothing was done to fix that i would book a double bed and avoid single beds i think it was simply a cheap bed though the mattress was very good and comfortable the wifi was great and the staff were very helpful there are no facilities in the hotel so very basic for a four stars
