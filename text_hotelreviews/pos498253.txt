staff was very friendly and helpful location is almost perfect as a starting point we went to scs first for some shopping and wasted hours while we could find just about everything in the mariahilferstrasse close to museums and the inner ring value for money was great would visit again tip you can park free on weekends on spaces marked with the white line
