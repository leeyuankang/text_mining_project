it is value for money we were lookng for something inexpensive with breakfast in a good location and this hotel met the requirements reasonably well the hotel was warm and cosy which was important as it was winter breakfast was quite good bed was comfortable bathroom was decent the room was clean location is pretty good as the street webgasse is directly connected to mariahilferstrasse the main shopping street in vienna and everything is easy to reach with the metro
