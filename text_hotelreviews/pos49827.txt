the location across the street from gloster road tube station was excellent the rooms were very comfortable if a little too warm and we couldn t adjust the room temperature there is a lovely staircase running through the building so you don t have to wait for the lifts in order to go up or down the porter on duty when we arrived was extremely helpful to us helping to get our bags out of our car and up the steps and into the lobby
