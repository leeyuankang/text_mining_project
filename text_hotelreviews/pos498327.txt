room was very spacious bright and airy was let down by silly things really beds very narrow and not very comfortable bed lights loose and shades damaged curtains that didn t quite fit the window so let the light in balcony overlooking garden would have been nice to sit out there in the sun if there had been any chairs no coffee tea making facilities ensuite was brilliant clean modern with a great wet room type shower everywhere was really clean though the white walls everywhere were a little tired and needed refreshing some of the hotel d cor was a little strange weird pictures in the breakfast room large pink budda type figure in reception but all in all good hotel good location easy access to metro about on main street just stops to city centre plenty of shops cafes restaurants etc but go and enjoy the beautiful city of vienna
