the room was surprisingly quiet for central london after an initial complaint about rattling air conditioning we were moved to another room on a higher floor the bed comfortable and the en suite was well laid out and of a decent size the staff were very polite and helpful and the manager kindly offered us glasses of champagne after discovering it was our wedding anniversary that weekend would definitely consider staying here again when next in town
