great location just a minute walk to the metro and a shopping and dining promenade comfortable beds nice size room and bath hotel is on a quiet street we never heard any street noise good air conditioning good wifi ivan at the front desk was especially kind and helpful in getting us settled in to our room after a minor glitch which resulted in a room change
