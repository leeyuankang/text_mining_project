excellent hotel the room was super comfortable and the inner yard was super quiet the breakfast was certainly good but should be more vegan friendly with less meat and animal stuff more vegan options one of the few negative things was the soap in the common wc on ground floor it had strong perfume that stuck to the hands and thus was very chemical a bad choice for a hotel that otherwise had at least some eco friendliness
