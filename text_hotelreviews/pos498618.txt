excellent location and very helpful staff especially at the reception i don t remember his name but the man at the reception who also speaks italian and checked us in was very friendly and helpful the room was clean and housekeeping came every day but they could ve replaced the shower gel and tissues in the bathroom sooner than the last day the bed is very comfortable of course this is a matter of preference the room is quiet even on the street side the windows are very well isolated breakfast is satisfying even if repetitive it s convenient and well stocked the ac worked very well the closet is large enough there is an incorporated baggage holding tray that you can hide when you re done unpacking the room was large enough for two people we liked staying here even if there are things the hotel can work on
