this was our second stay within a few days at this hotel see previous review this time we were in a standard room which not surprisingly was a little smaller than an executive room however the room was still big enough for our needs and not cramped we didn t notice much if any difference between the standard and executive rooms except for the space nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities staff were friendly and spoke good english which was useful as our german language skills failed us sometimes line is about minutes walk away and the westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the u bahn the area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on mariahilfer strasse
