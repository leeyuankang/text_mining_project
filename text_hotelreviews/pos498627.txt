nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities we were upgraded to an executive room which was spacious there was an option to pay an extra euros for use of the mini bar which we declined to take staff were friendly and spoke good english which was useful as our german language skills failed us sometimes line is about minutes walk away and the westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the u bahn the area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on mariahilfer strasse and there is a useful supermarket on the same street as the hotel
