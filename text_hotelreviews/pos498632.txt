the location was a huge plus it is exactly minutes to walk to the metro station and stops to the city centre the hotel staff were friendly and courteous the room was of average size but had all the basic facilities and comfortable beds the windows opened into the backyard the bathroom had good facilities plenty of hot water but only liquid soap dispensers there is a supermarket just up the street and a major shopping precinct with plenty of restaurants of all flavours near the metro station the superb gluten free restaurant zum wohl is within walking distance
