very cosy hotel unlike many hotels in wien wifi is working very good and heating is actually enough it was a nice stay very clean bed is confortable and the hotel staff left a good impression compared with other hotels in the same price this one was the best choice breakfast could have more variety but all in all it was very good location is near to the shopping street and you can get very easy in the center by u bahn or walking km
