most of the hotels pensions i have tried in that area of the city in the price range of eur per night had either too small rooms or were too old or feeling cheap or were not so comfortable in general so i did not expect a lot from this hotel and was very pleasantly surprised it was indeed quite modern very clean the room was adequately spacious and facilities and services were good so it s my definite candidate for another stay
