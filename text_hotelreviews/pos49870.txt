exceptional hotel very conveniently located next to several tube lines the room was cleaned everything looked like new we lived on the floor so it was very quiet at night very safe area if we ever will visit london again we will definitely stay in this hotel we did not ate at the restaurant because we like to have a light breakfast and there are many small and large places around the hotel as well as supermarkets what surprised me was that hotel supplied us regularly with the bottled water and cookies thank you from the airport we took the subway and it brought us directly to the station next to hotel however i want to warn you that there are some steps you need to manage from the train level only then there is an elevator for a ground floor so do not pack too heavy bags on the way back to the airport be very careful with the train the name of the train can be the same but at some point they go in different directions some to the airport some to other location we were able to manage that and reached the airport on time but give yourself an extra hour just in case we had a card that can be replenished at any station it is very convenient at the beginning each card requires pounds deposit the deposit and the remaining balance was returned to us at the airport but not all machines has this feature there are agents on each station that helps with buying a card and a refund but can be a long line so do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with the machines so you knew how to receive your money back we were told that refund can be up to pounds plus deposit but at the airport agent said they returning up to pounds there are no rules posted anywhere refund was in cash
