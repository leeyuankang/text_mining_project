normally i never write reviews but since this is the third time i have stayed at this property and return because it is so wonderful i feel obliged to say something for anyone who does not require a pool a spa etc this might be the loveliest hotel you ll find anywhere it is in the very best location in the first district of vienna it has wonderful historical bones the staff is gracious and helpful and the breakfast is quintessentially viennese it is immaculately clean the beds are wonderful and even a single room is spacious very nicely appointed and welcoming i return to kaiserin elisabeth for all of the reasons i ve listed i would not trade the ke for the imperial or the bristol where i have also stayed
