classy old world charm superb location our room was very spacious with high ceilings and immaculate linens big bathroom with double sinks seperate shower and great water pressure very nice breakfast service helpful gentlemen who staff the front desk room was very quiet excellent maid service we also used their car service to and from the airport which worked very well and took a lot of stress out of the whole process
