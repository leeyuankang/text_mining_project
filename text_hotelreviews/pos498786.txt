nice friendly and professional service receptionists were quite formal and old school elegantly dressed but without being stuffy and my room was great good choice and quality at breakfast and fabulous location in the heart of everything in the city i will definitely return there the lounge area is also elegantly appointed and convenient for business meetings and work sessions
