we had stayed my wife and i at hotel kaiserin elisabeth over thirty years ago we liked it very much then the hotel exudes old world charm some find it old fashioned it is centrally located in the inner city a stone throw away from k rntner strasse and stephansdom this stay as with the first we had a comfy room in the back which made it very quiet the furniture is a collection of old fashioned bulky items the bathroom is not modern the sink miniscule it is a high climb to get into the bath tub something to do carefully and slowly if you don t want to hurt your back overall the ambience remained the same as if stuck in the past old fashioned and rather stuffy some of the staff is as old fashioned as the furniture a couple of the staff even became rather condescending when we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel one of the staff was nosy and initiated a chat about personal things at booking time the staff will nicely offer to buy you concert tickets it took several emails to make them admit they charge a fee vienna is not cheap and this fact is well reflected in the high price at kaiserin elisabeth
