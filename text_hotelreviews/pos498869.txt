the quality of the facility and price paid for the room was well aligned the room was classicly furnished with updated amenities wifi was fast unlike many hotels that provide minimal wifi service and lots of outlets in room to access for recharging of all our toys that have become part of the travel experience location was fantastic close to shopping sites and great selection of restaurants
