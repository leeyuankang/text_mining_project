brilliant location in the heart of the historic centre of vienna but peaceful and soooo welcoming warm and friendly best hotel staff i have ever encountered spotlessly clean and the most comfortable beds we could have wished for cant wait for a return visit i would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel
