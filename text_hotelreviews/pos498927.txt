the hotel kaiserin elizabeth is a two minute walk from st stephen s cathedral and a minute from kaffe frauenhuber where both mozart and beethoven played the concierge at the hotel was excellent knowledgeable about the local area polite and personable even though when i first arrived i was a little dishevelled from my journey up from morahalom in hungary the room was lovely the bed very comfortable and breakfast delicious i would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and vienna in general to any traveller it was an utter pleasure to have stayed here
