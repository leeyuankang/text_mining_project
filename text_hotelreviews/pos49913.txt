the location opposite gloucester road station in interesting area of london kensington some beautiful houses and streets around the corner loved the character of the hotel its quiet there are some great eating places nearby for all budgets there are lines on this underground piccadilly district and circle line so its great for reaching most places easily i was in green park minutes after leaving my room
