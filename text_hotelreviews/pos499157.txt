great room very large and very clean we were able to fit a crib and still have a ton of space to move around great location a little far from dam square and the hustle and bustle of the city but that was a perk everything is walkable and there is a tram stop right in from of the hotel the area that the hotel is in was lovely and had a really great market a couple of blocks away
