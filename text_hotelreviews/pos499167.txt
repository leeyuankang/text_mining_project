excellent location and the tram stop is just across from the hotel making it easy to access all parts of amsterdam all the staff are friendly and the room was excellent our room overlooked the tram stop but we never heard any noise excellent restaurants in walking distance zazas was fantastic and well worth a visit we stumbled across bazar a middle eastern restaurant only minutes walk from the hotel the food was excellent and great value for money
