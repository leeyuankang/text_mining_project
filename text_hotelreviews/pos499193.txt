i chose to stay here for my birthday the staff was very welcoming and sincere i probably enjoyed that the most the bed was suuuuuuper comfortable this is a very classy hotel to stay at i thought the bathroom and shower were very cool even though i didn t use it the staff behind the bar were awesome they played great music those girls were really fun to talk to especially the interns who were just starting out they made my stay very pleasant
