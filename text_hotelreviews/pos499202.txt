the room was fab very modern with a free mini bar and nepresso machine who can complain they also gave you robes and slippers to make you feel extra fancy after your fabulous shower they had little favours everywhere in our room which really makes your stay here special it is a little out from the centre walk wise but with the tram outside the door u can hop on and off it outside all the main areas it was amazing i would recommend getting a ticket that would do you the length of your stay because its euros a pop and you would be surprised how it can tot up also literally minutes walk to the sign museums and heineken experience and in all i reckon i would stay here again
