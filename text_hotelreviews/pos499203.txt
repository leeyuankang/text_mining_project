the hotel is a little way out of the mix of things but the tram is right outside and so easy to use we walked every time we went anywhere but did get the tram back to the central station the hotel is lovely classy and clean the staff were amazingly helpful also providing a map and marking any areas you have an interest in check in was seemless bags were taken and stored and then put in our room the room was spacious and clean the hotel leaves small bottles of wine complimentary and a small fridge with bottled water fresh orange diet coke and pringles there are lots of good restaurants located near the hotel we had the most amazing steak at an argentinian restaurant en route to rembrandt square i would highly recommend this hotel
