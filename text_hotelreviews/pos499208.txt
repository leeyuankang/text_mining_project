i loved this hotel it s elegant and has a wonderful vibe to it the staff are amazing and very welcoming and they know how to make you feel special the happy hour at their bar is just perfect as they offer cocktails that are so nice and for just euro the mattress owh what can i say about that they invested in these mattresses as they have memory foam mattresses which makes you feel like you are sleeping on clouds for me i actually don t prefer these kind of mattresses as they are too soft for my back as i have back problems so i do actually prefer firm mattresses but i didn t mind sleeping on it for one night the furniture decore is just wonderful and feels posh the bathroom has a wonderful rainfall shower and great basin the offer toothbrush paste which i find very handy for someone who is on the move this kind of service wasn t even offered by movinpeckhotel the hotel is also very close to shops and amazing restaurants all around the tram is just couple of steps from the hotel the view from my room wasn t much but i knew about this as i didn t book the room that faces the canals i was on the floor but you need to keep in mind some rooms are in the top floor or the basement therefore these rooms might not even have a good view and might be smaller with no windows hince some of the reviews here that might seem misleading
