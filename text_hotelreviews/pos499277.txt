all in all a nice little hotel nearby the center of amsterdam however u need some time to get to the most visited places by bike by foot the room is too small for what it costs but it is clean an the bed is comfortable the basics are just fine but nothing special with the room we were even a little disappointent the breakfast doesent offer a big variety but what u find there tastes really good so it gives a good start in the day well its a nice little hotel where u can have a nice stay but next time we will definately go somewhere else it is just too expensive for what it offers
