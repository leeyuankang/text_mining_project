the hotel is on several tram and bus routes plus close to some awesome breakfast restaurants the mini bar was restocked each day free of charge the staff were very helpful my only complaint would be the dinner menu and cost but we expected a high hotel cost so are elsewhere we were fine with the high price but the portions were very tiny loved the room decor the big windows and the techy features
