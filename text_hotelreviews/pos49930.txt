we booked this very last minute on the afternoon of arrival so we got a great deal online with booking com engineering works on the trains that weekend would have made our journey home impossible so we treated ourselves to an overnight stay in london after a party the room was nicely decorated recently so i believe and the bathroom was well equipped nice to have a full sized bath with shower over lovely big comfy bed the rate didn t include breakfast and i m sure it would have been delicious but it was bit expensive for us so we found a lovely little cafe around the corner in the morning instead excellent location with the tube cafes and restaurants all within a minute s walk we d definitely like to stay again
