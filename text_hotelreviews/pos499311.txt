we took an attic room which i thought would be rather small but it was very spacious clean cosy room nicely decorated reliable internet and comfortable bed hotel mins walk from dam square but there is also a tram stop just outside the hotel very close to the heineken experience and local cafes markets less hectic and a change from the main tourist spots staff were most helpful and welcoming
