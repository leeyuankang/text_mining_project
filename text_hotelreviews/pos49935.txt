having lived in south kensington in the i was aware of the excellent location it is literally across the round from gloucester rd tube station and thus on the piccadilly line direct from heathrow alternative is the quicker but rather more expensive heathrow express to paddington then underground on the district and circle line the hotel has an impressive foyer reception is friendly and efficient the hotel is decorated with period photos and decorations my bedroom looked out onto reasonably busy gloucester rd yet thanks to double glazing there was little street noise the room was was a nice size with attractive furnishing very clean functional with a good sized desk and two comfortable chairs the bathroom was excellent the room was serviced to a very high standard laundry though expensive is quick and reliable i was given free wifi which worked well i was not disturbed by internal noise i ate breakfast at local cafes and once in the hotel which was a standard cooked buffet with sufficient choices there are plenty of places to eat locally cafes restaurants and two pubs with a larger and better choice minutes walk away on old brompton road getting into central london is easy via the underground i also recommend walking around the area minutes to chelsea high st kensington and to knightsbridge london hotels can be pricey for not much however baileys is very good value for all the above reasons i can certainly see myself staying there again
