just spent the last nights at this hotel loved it just a short tram ride outside the main centre of amsterdam on a direct tram line number from amsterdam s central station the number tram stops right outside the hotel we had an early flight so got to the hotel about not being able to officially check in until however john on reception checked us in took our luggage until our rooms were ready it was my wife s birthday so they upgraded us to a canal view room said that they would put our room on a priority to get in early would call us if this was possible when we got into our room we had complimentary bottles of prosecco as a birthday treat the room was spacious bathrobes slippers in the wardrobe a mini bar the bathroom was modern however the frosted glass door didn t have a proper closing mechanism which was slightly odd the beds are very soft with a memory foam topper brilliant if you like that but way too soft for me room service menu which is as extensive not overly priced neither was the bar prices the staff were very helpful offered advice on where to go happy to make bookings for trips restaurant reservations check in at check out at but staff happy to keep hold of your luggage if you have early late flights the hotel does reserve on your credit card until check out so be prepared for this on arrival
