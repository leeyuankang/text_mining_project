great location minutes walk from museum quarter heineken experience and a couple of the canal tour companies pretty much everything else was within a reasonable min walk for us and of course it s all flat staff courteous and friendly our attic room was large quiet and comfortable used the restaurant a couple of times as it was exceptionally cold in the evenings during our stay food was great and a similar price to other restaurants we ate in
