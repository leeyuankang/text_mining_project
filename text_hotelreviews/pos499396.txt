hotel itself is in prime location just outside all the madness of central amsterdam can easily walk anywhere and tram line is outside front door staff are excellent and very friendly the sweets and chocolates available in reception were always a passing bonus room was on floor in the attic and was lovely everything was very clean and excellent place to stay for a couple of nights downstairs bar and restaurant seemed very good although we always are out loved staying here and would recommend it to anyone seeking a small boutique hotel in amsterdam because this is exactly what you want
