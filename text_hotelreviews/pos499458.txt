everything was great wifi staff always helpful with tips and the room was spacious and super modern and clean we had a nespresso machine and were able to enjoy nice coffee in the morning and some tea at night since there was an electric kettle as well the tram stop is next to the hotel super easy access to the city and also the canal near the hotel has the hop on hop off canal boat tour stop which was very convenient
