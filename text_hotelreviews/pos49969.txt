it was a great experience during my stay for nights perfect location right opposite tube station and walking distance to v a sience museums if you are a fun of theatre or shopping this place is right for you only a few stops to piccadilly circus and leicester square i only wish if they could provide free internet connection in the room rather than just in the lobby i would visit the hotel again next time
