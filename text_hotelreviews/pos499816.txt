an utterly despicable level of customer service upon arrival we were informed the hotel was full and our room was no longer available after travelling over miles to be informed of this without prior notice was frankly inexcusable we were offered no facilities to freshen up we waited a further hours to be relocated to another hotel subsequently missing part of a concert that we in town to see i will be demanding a full refund a horrible experience staff completely unsympathetic unhelpful and incompetence on a level i ve never witnessed before i will be taking this matter to the highest level such was the utter contempt with which we were treated by the manager of this hotel
