i thought the staff were fabulous and could not do enough for my son and i we had come up to london to watch england v portugal at wembley stadium and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we got there and back safely we were also later back than planned and so missed room service but the staff on the desk got out the takeaway menus so that we did not go hungry staff were friendly attentive and professional
