i booked the crowne plaza as we were seeing coldplay at wembley stadium the location wasn t the best but the whole area isn t great saying that it only cost in an uber each way to the stadium so we were happy with that our room was perfect and the bed so comfy i d put in a special request as it was my fianc s birthday and we had a bottle of complimentary wine in our room with a card which was lovely breakfast was great staff really friendly apologising if you wait more than a minute room service was good too they had late night options on especially for the concert would definitely stay again if we were going to the stadium
