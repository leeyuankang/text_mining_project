we stayed here to see coldplay at wembley it was in an excellent location for the price the bus runs to the stadium but you need to make sure you leave plenty of time as the route to wembley gets very congested we gave up on the bus on the way home due to volume of people and managed to get an uber totally understandable though given the number of people attending busy public transport to be expected we loved the hotel staff really friendly very confortable bedroom and great nights sleep breakfast was fantastic would highly recommend
