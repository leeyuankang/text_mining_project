spacious clean room bed was nice and comfy bathroom was very clean breakfast was good as well they offer a little bit of everything and the option to order eggs pancakes of the menu the parking facility at the hotel was great since we came by car at a fair price gbp p day the hotel is located a bit far from the centre of london which reflects in the price this is not really a problem though since the underground hangar lane is literally in front of the hotel the central line takes you to the city centre in about minutes be prepared for the rush hour though london commuting can be crazy staff was very friendly wifi was good used it for facebook whatsapp internet browsing great price value
