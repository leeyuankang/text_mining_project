we were greeted at the reception by a very helpful and friendly member of staff who promptly assisted us by getting taxis arranged for us to get to wembley stadium the rooms were very clean and spacious and beds very comfortable the bar was not badly priced and breakfast the following morning was very good with a varied choice the tube station is opposite and was easy for us to get to london sites easily would definitely recommend it and would return again thank you
