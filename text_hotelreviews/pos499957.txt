exceptionally friendly staff who really went out of their way to be helpful an excellent breakfast and very good value for what we paid because of distance from centre position by very busy road i rate position as good rather than excellent but it is very conveniently positioned just outside exit from hanger lane subway and tube station directly on the central line
