after being let down by citadines south kensington they were relocating my husband and i to another side of london without prior notice we took a chance on a nearby hotel millennium bailey s and we re glad we did i don t know why citadines label their branch as posh as they don t even have a porter and well lit lounge unlike bailey s the staff were very welcoming and courteous the room we were assigned in was a good size for a london location even though the hotel is next to a tube station and a busy road we didn t hear much of the noise from outside there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby moreover the natural history museum and the royal albert hall are just walking distance all in all my husband and i had a pleasant stay many thanks
