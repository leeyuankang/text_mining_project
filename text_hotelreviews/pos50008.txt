i was delighted to visit this hotel and have such a warm reception the staff went out of their way to help us find the venue we were visiting in the evening the hotel is right next to the tube station we needed and yet it was quiet in the room at night the room is not huge but the bed was comfy and we had everything we needed i would definitely recommend this place and would use again great value for money there are lots of small cafes and supermarkets in close proximity it is within walking distance of the victoria and albert and natural history museums
