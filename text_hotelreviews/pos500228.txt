the hotel was very modern and stylish the staff very helpful and kind which i loved the breakfast was lovely and fresh beds are very comfy i did feel the room i wasn t aware prior the room was that size or layout and the bathroom as well was quite small it would ve been nice to see pictures too but overall good experience
