i had booked a room with a river view and the views from the hotel room window were magnificent in the morning you could see some people swimming in the royal victoria dock i loved the decor and the room was very comfortable i also recommend taking the river bus and the cable car to get to the hotel from central london you get a whole new perspective on london
