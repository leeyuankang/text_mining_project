the good hotel is really good although it looks like a container barge and it is really floating everything is new nice and modern we spent two nights there during a hot week in june and i have to admit that the air conditioning was able to keep the room cool note the room safe which was not only present but really worked the staff is very friendly and helpful they manage everything with a smile really enjoying stay and with the non profit idea you can say that you re helping a bit
