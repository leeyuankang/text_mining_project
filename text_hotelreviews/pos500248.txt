located around a min walk to excel london i arrived late night and the staff were very friendly and welcoming the room was very clean and nice the worry doll on my pillow was and unexpected and cute touch no hairdryer in room can be requested no screens either really is just a nice clean calm space to sleep i loved the community ethos of this hotel i would stay again
