i absolutely recommend it the rooms are not huge but light and well equipped the hotel s style is minimal but really stylish and fresh i loved it the room comes with a free to use uk sim phone with unlimited internet usage so in case you have no time to charge your own it s really handy i was a bit wary of the transportation but i must say the location is perfect with easy access to the city by always good service of dlr i have to add as other reviewers have also mentioned that the bathroom doors are sort of semi transparent and symbolic if privacy matters for you and you re travelling with somenone else than your sibling or partner it s better two book two rooms ps the hotel is literally shipped from the netherlands and it s suited with both uk electrical sockets and the original eu standard ones so if you re travelling from eu you don t need to carry an adapter
