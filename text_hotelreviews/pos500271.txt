it was just amazing the staff were fab the person checking me in apologise about my room not quite being ready not that i had an issue with that but even so she treated me very well and offered me a drink while i waited i also love the idea of a mobile phone coming with each room which is perfect to take as a back up phone incase your one goes down and you need to contact someone in an emergency the rooms were small but still felt very roomy
