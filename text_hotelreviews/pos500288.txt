a lovely welcome from reception on arrival and helping us with transport arrangements we enjoyed a water side room with a view over to the arena the rooms are small but extremely clean modern and a lovely shower the tube station royal victoria is a minute walk away use seagull lane exit very convenient plus the emirates cable cars station is on the doorstep too we loved the bar area and relaxing sofas dotted around it had a very modern feel
