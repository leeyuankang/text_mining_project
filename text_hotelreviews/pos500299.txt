this hotel was very easily accessible once you knew hoe to find it the nearest tube station is royal victoria and then you cross the road and follow the path to towards the emirate docks where the cable cars start terminate it took us a while because we got off the tube at canning town and walked but when we found it great the girl that checked us in was efficient and helpful the whole experience was stressfree the facilities are excellent and for the price we paid we couldn t have got better value for money it was a last minute booking and i would go again i would highly recommend this hotel
