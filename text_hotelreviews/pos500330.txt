excellent location if visiting the arena right next to the emirates cable car which is a lovely scenic ride over the river to the be aware this closes at pm if you intend to take the trip back to the hotel we were on a whistle stop tour for one night to see john mayer and this is the ideal spot to stay hotel is comfortable and the staff are very friendly there is a quirky boat bar worth a visit just a short walk around the dockside and a nice thai restaurant just a bit further along which we would recommend
