room was very comfortable with very pleasant views of the waterfront we were excited to hear of the rooftop bar but unfortunately it was under construction and not accessible during our stay love the dockside location allows you to travel into the centre of london in a variety of modes we opted for emirate air cable car and ferry to tower london very pleasant
