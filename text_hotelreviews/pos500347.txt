we loved the location of the hotel we travelled over to the for our concert and we took the emirates air line across and then the tube on the return journey which was just stops there was no parking on site but there s a multi story across the road and it s a flat rate of for which is great we loved the quirkiness of the hotel and the story behind how it was made and how it arrived in london the staff were extremely friendly very welcoming and always ready to help we chose a river view room which was wonderful and i had one of the best nights sleep i ve ever had when staying in a hotel room and i ve stayed in quite a few we didn t eat here so i cannot comment on the food
