stayed here on a visit to the part of its appeal to me was the quirkiness of the hotel being on the river the hotel is much more than that though the room is very aesthetically pleasing and clean the price of the room for london was very good value the bed was super comfortable staff were on hand and the location was superb i found the emirates cable car the best way to reach the hotel because the hotel is in clear view from the cars i d make sure to visit again
