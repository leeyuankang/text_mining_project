the hotel was spotlessly clean throughout small and compact bedroom with crisp white bed linen no tv but had ipad and phone and good wifi connection meant that a tv was not necessary unusual design and concept for a hotel with the feel of being on a boat or barge but it worked really well as it was situated on water with great visual surroundings emirates cable car a stones throw away and dlr minutes away made this a perfect location to get to any entertainment venue the living room and lounge area was spacious and modern the food was good friendly staff perfect hotel for a stop over on a night out will definitely return back
