we both had a lovely nights sleep and would stay again if we needed somewhere for the night and even better was late check out wasn t an issue so we had a lovely lie in looking over the river thames there was no in room entertainment which was a refreshing change meaning we weren t looking at a tv hanging over the bed the rooms were minimalist yet cozy and well furnished for the style with convenient storage solutions i would say this hotel is ideal for one or two nights but the rooms wouldn t suffice for any more than this as i think cabin fever could be an issue
