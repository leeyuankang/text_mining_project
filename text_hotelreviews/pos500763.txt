the bath was huge and nice to relax in just take your own bath salts bubble bath and relax in a nice hot bath or if you prefer a shower it was roomy and a nice flow of water but not a power shower the room was spacious with a decent size comfortable bed the fridge is big enough to put in few cans and pint plastic milk carton the food there is pricey but very tasty but no dearer than most other hotels they have a great selection of wines and whisky but not larger or beer or cider if that s what you drink the staff are pleasant and helpful and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel that buses and tour buses stop you are within walking distance of big ben the london eye and a few other attractions and about a ten minute walk of waterloo train station and a minute stroll away from covent garden piccadilly leicester square or a minute tube ride there is a nice little convenience store about yards away which a wide range of products like a spar a little pricey compared to a supermarket but you are in the centre of london
