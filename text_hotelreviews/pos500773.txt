the duplex room we stayed it we got via e upgrade at a reduced rate and it had a fantastic view of big ben and good facilities even if we had not got that particular room it would still have been a great base from which to explore central london as you would expect the room was clean and tidy and well maintained whilst we stayed at the hotel
