location is the reason we chose this hotel it was easy to step outside for a taxi or walk across the bridge to catch the tube i liked the modern decor of the rooms the living room was a little dark but our daughter was using the sofa bed which she said was fine it served as a second bedroom for us the bathroom lighting was nice and bright but the glass door didn t afford total privacy there was a mini fridge with enough room for small items and there was also a mini bar with a sink which was handy when two of us had to get ready the microwave was also handy for reheating food
