highly recommend this hotel so convenient to everything the suite was perfect for our family of four since our daughters are still small enough to share the sofa bed in the living room they loved the spa pool which is dark and dramatically lit my husband and i really enojoyed the lobby lounge for drinks dinner and live music in the evenings the food was great honestly there is nothing negative i can say about our stay at this hotel we usuallly stay at hiltons and this was on par with our experiences there if that helps give you a reference
