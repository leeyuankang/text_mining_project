the one bedroom suite was just fantastic after travelling for weeks we enjoyed all the luxuries super comfy bed and pillows bathroom had a show and separate bath kitchen for cooking our own breakfast and a coffee machine dining table and lounge room there was even a loofa razer shaving cream as well as all the usual shampoo etc we just had so much room to spread out after a lot of small rooms through europe it was very close to westminster bridge westminster abbey the london eye being in walking distance the room was expensive though
