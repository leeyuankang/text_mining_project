the primo bar was excellent service was very good staff friendly and the lobster rolls soup salad burgers selection of wines etc were all very good we enjoyed our first late night meal there so much we ate there times in total the only down side of this restaurant bar they charged my sister pound for a harvey wallbanger essentially vodka galliano and orange juice wow
