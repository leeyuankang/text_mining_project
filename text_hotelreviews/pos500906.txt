we loved the room and the ability to have breakfast and afternoon tea and evening drinks at the hotel with the upgrade despite the construction around the hotel it was very pleasant we had a view of the london eye from our room and at night it was spectacular the hotel is convenient to westminster bridge big ben parliament the war museums etc we left just before the latest terror attacks on london bridge and area so enjoyed it all thoroughly we could hop on and off the big tour buses right near the hotel
