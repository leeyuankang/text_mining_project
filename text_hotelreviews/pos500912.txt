we had a family room and the main bed was very comfortable we just had to add an extra blanket on the mattress of the sofa bed but then it was fine the room was pleasant although a little dark during the day as there was no direct daylight which is good to sleep in in the morning though excellent location it is so easy and quick to get anywhere also really appreciated the gesture of the delicious birthday cake delivered to the room for the little boy s birthday it made his day the pool was very nice too the reception staff was lovely we had a catalan lady checking us in who was really lovely and personal in fact all the staff was very nice and friendly
