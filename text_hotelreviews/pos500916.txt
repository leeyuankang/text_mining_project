stayed at the hotel for two nights and thought it was excellent pricey as you would expect for london but with a deal the price compares very well with other hotels nearby and the facilities are much better rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the hotel location is excellent for exploring london being close to waterloo main line and underground stations as well as buses to various parts of central london the london eye and the river are only a couple of minutes walk away looking forward to staying there again later in the year
