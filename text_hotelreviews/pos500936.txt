the location was excellent and accessibility was good for me being an electric wheelchair user receptionist we noted was a trainee and did an excellent job of making us feel very welcome and explaining where everything was within the hotel we popped down to see the pool and spa area although we ran out of time to be able to use maybe next time the disabled friendly bathroom was very good for my needs
