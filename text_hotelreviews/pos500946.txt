the hotel was simply delightful a warm quick welcome and check in with my son and swiftly given keys to a the room on the floor looking outwards to big ben and the london eye an immaculate bathroom lounge and sleeping area very well appointed and designed this was a special trip for my son and i to explore london and have some quality time together wish we could of stayed longer but will be back soon the bars and the restaurants were a joy and the food first class nothing i could say was an issue at all ice machine on every floor fridge space in the room with a microwave and played glasses etc every detail has been considered at this hotel
