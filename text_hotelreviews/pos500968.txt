the room was lovely bed was firm and fresh having a hidden wardrobe kept the look layout of the room flowing the large single picture of a flower on the wall like doors of the wardrobe was a great way to incorporate art design in the layout of the room the views when you step off the lifts spectacular the beauty of the architectural structure design of the hotel from the lifts a treat for the eyes my room was quiet peaceful only noise was from what my girls and i made i would definitely stay again one night is not enough one requires a minimum of two nights to unwind and yet soak up your surroundings
