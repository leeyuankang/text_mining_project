the location is perfect i can t imagine anything better from location you can see big ben from your window just from the hotel you can go to any of both underground stations waterloo and westminster london eye big ben westminster abbey buckingham palace imperial war museum rooms are clean and big enough we booked family room with two beds two tvs room was cleaned every day the breakfast is good but all days the same i wished they could exchange dishes sometimes what i missed was a a good coffee for the breakfast there were only two coffee machines which were used by all guests in different floors the breakfast areas were on lobby level and in underground level local restaurant was good and cheap enough cheaper than outside nice and clean sauna good fitness room
