the room was spotless clean had lots of tea coffee etc we found this hotel to be very family friendly as we had children within our family party even left a little birthday cake treat for my grandson in our room as they knew we were visiting for his birthday the staff were very polite friendly we enjoyed our meal in the hotel restaurant also the coffee bar downstairs was good value staff were also very polite friendly good location for sightseeing london eye the tour buses i can not fault anything about our stay in this hotel if you can spare the cash upgrade to a big ben view it was well worth the upgrade we could not find any fault with this hotel hoping to book again soon thank you
