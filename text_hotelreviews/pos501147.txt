the bed was very comfortable but the sofa bed was not the suite was beautiful nice separate areas with two tv s so if one could watch without disturbing the others there even was a microwave location was super hotel views were amazing just like the website bar food lovely great selection and great opening hours it is a beautiful hotel and i would definitely return
