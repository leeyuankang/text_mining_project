dear madam sir the flight was cancelled because of the storm far too late chaos at schiphol i had watched my telephone and e mail during the whole day everybody knew a storm was coming but the flights were only cancelled one and a half hour before i had to be in london early next morning long queues without any information like cattle it was impossible to call ba got an answering machine in the middle of the night i took the train to rotterdam took a hotel for four hours all very helpful and understanding staff there and arranged by my daughter at the same time she bought a ticket on own expenses from another flight company i took the flight from rotterdam early next morning which was also all right with very helpful people early in the morning in london they seemed to have annulated my room from booking com almost euro s for three nights in the end we were able to got a lousy small room without daylight for only two nights no refund at all it was typical because i called and spoke to three different persons from the plaza westminster hotel the night before i told them to keep my room for the other two days because i had this mini congress in st thomas hospital and my aunt visited me in london i still enjoyed being in london but not because of british airways and booking com never again bastiaan gerhards md gp
