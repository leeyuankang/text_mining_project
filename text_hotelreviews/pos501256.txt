the brassiere joel was the best restaurant i ve been too and to make it even better it is located in the hotel the king studio room i stayed in with my partner was amazing however i wish we upgraded to the duplex king suite my brother and family were in the view of big ben and the london eye etc on the terrace was lovely overall i hope to be back for my birthday as the location and hotel was great and most definitely worth the money
