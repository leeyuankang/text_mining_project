this is the time we ve stayed here this month last time i asked for a room with a view of the london eye and it was a good one partial but perfect from sitting on the bed studio suite again perfect for family location is fantastic very close to loads of restaurants at the southbank centre short walk across bridges to key london attractions close to waterloo station london is the most amazing city our waitress in the lobby bar was very good
