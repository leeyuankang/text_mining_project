our room was on the floor and had an excellent view of the london eye there is an indoor pool and fitness room these are located on a floor however the location of these seem to be a missing opportunity to not put them in an area with a view the pool is small for the hotel size but nice and there is a sauna and a steam room the fitness room is nice with various cardio machines and weights one of the better fitness rooms in europe the hotel was clean and had great ambiance in the lobby at christmas with a nice sleigh for kids to sit and get pictures in addition the hotel is secure and at night they make sure only guests enter the hotel the temperature is easy to control in the room which makes it easy to regulate and adjust there are also various restaurants in the hotel and a coffee shop the hotel is min walk from starbucks and a nice italian restaurant the waterloo tube and train station is a min walk and the walk to the westminster tube station which is next to big ben is also around min waterloo is not the best area but ok if you just head west and not east
