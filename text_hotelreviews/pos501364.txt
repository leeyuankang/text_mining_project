the location of the hotel is excellent less than minutes walking distance from big ben and london eye the bed was very spacious and comfortable and although it s such a huge hotel it was very quiet at night the bathrobes were very fluffy not the worn out hard ones you usually get we got a free room upgrade from no window to window facing inner yard because there were no more rooms of the category we had booked available staff was nice but service at the hotel bar was a bit slow
