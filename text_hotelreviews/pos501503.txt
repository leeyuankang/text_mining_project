amazing stay my mum i came with my little sisters and we had one of the studio rooms which was a great size loved that there were two tv s and the rooms were separated meant we could stay up later whilst they slept the hotel was spotless and such an amazing location minute walk to westminster tube to get where we needed also within walking distance to so many of the sights will be back
