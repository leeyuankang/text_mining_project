i could not fault this hotel or its staff everything was superb room service was excellent breakfast arrived exactly on time and was delicious the room itself was spacious and clean bathroom products were lovely i also used the spa and it was two hours of heaven it was a bit expensive but it is the centre of london and as a treat it was worth it
