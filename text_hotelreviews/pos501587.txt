everything was lovely i especially like the black glass theme all over the hotel had a real sofisticated look i stayed here as i had an appointment at st thomas for an operation it was just across the road so ideally located the room had a really relaxing feel just what you need befor an op will defo stay here again next time i ll stay longer and get an upgrade with views although we could see big ben we had to look sideways out of the window but was still good ideally set for anyone visiting london everything you want to see is on the doorstep or just a short walk or taxi ride away
