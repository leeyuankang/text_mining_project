i thought the hotel was very clean and welcoming located in a great place the hotel is close to a lot of the attractions this being my visit the rooms are comfy and there is no noise from other rooms all the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much i noticed this visit some things had changed the staff acknowledged you more than the previous visit
