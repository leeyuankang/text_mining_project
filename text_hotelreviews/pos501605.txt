i thought the hotel looked stunning it was amazing to walk into and lovely and clean the room was lovely too beds were so comfy the bathroom was very impressive the staff were friendly and helpful the location was excellent only a very short walk away from waterloo station i loved how as soon as you walked out of the hotel big ben was right in front of you and the london eye was very close also i liked the feel of the hotel made you feel like you were on holiday and we were only there for one night overall we had a lovely time at a very impressive hotel
