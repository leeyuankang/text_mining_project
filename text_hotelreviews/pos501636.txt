it was perfectly situated with access to local sights the staff were friendly and very helpful the pool and spa was really relaxed and comfortable the breakfast was lovely and plenty to choose from the hotel gave us a discount upon arrival which was a nice touch the room was spacious and had everything we needed the minibar was a little pricey though which i m sure would put guests off
