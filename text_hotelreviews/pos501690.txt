this was a little pricey for us so we were only staying night but it was worth every penny we had a king studio room the kids had a sofa bed in the living area which was already made up ready for us we had a slight view of the london eye to the left if we had been a little higher up the view would have been amazing although we were more than happy lovely modern bathroom and the kitchen facilities were a great bonus the breakfast had a massive choice and was mostly very good we were downstairs in the second room and it was packed but the food was hot and service fab the small children play area in the corner was a genius idea the location was perfect for exploring london pretty much as close to westminster bridge as you can get and min walk to the embankment with all the entertainment and bars restaurants and less than mins to the underground the whole hotel was spotless very modern and fancy a real treat
