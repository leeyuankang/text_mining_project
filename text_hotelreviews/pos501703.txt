we had a lovely time but the only thing that messed it up was the lack of communication between the front desk and the spa i had emailed the treatment details over twice in a fortnight but once we got there nothing was sorted or booked this was extremely disappointing as the treatment was meant to be a surprise for my wife we finally had to go directly to the spa take the last available slot on the saturday completely rearrange our dinner reservations evening plans
