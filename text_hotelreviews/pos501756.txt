we arrived at the hotel at and we wanted to drop our bags so we can go and explore the attractions nearby our room was already available so we got straight in unpacked and on our way such a lovely start of our trip brill location for attractions by foot and tube station is only mins away choice of restaurants in the hotel and they are not too expensive and taste amazing clean and modern rooms will definitely return
