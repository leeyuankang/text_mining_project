the hotel has a fantastic location right across from big ben great for access to the river thames attractions walking to buckingham palace and other main areas this is a very clean modern hotel busy hotel pretty well organised and staff seemed friendly enough especially the doormen breakfast is very busy however the food is fresh selection is a bit limited room is very modern and clean we stayed in a studio king a view of big ben if you looked to the left and rooms opposite and it had everything we needed to be comfortable it was the hottest day of the year while we were there but the rooms were lovely and cool will definitely stay here again due the location and overall feel of the hotel
