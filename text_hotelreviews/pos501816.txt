location if you face westminster you get great views of big ben parliament london eye rooms are large for that location acs worked well staff generally very friendly though some cleaners struggled with basic english beds are very comfortable the cleaner in our first room was amazing restocking the bathroom every day and washing dirty glasses etc lots to do and explore in the area and easy to walk to most major london attractions lots of restaurants nearby
