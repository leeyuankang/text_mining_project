superbly appointed modern clean and spacious rooms plenty of plug sockets including native us and eu ones for international travellers comfy bed quiet great bathroom and particularly a reliable shower everything is provided including decent hairdryer iron and board and enough wardrobe space hangers for a long stay food is good as well judged by what we were served in the conference centre rather than the hotel restaurant and the bar lounge area is comfortable with good attentive service
