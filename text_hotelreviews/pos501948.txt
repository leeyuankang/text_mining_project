i couldn t fault the service or quality of the hotel in general i booked this for my wife s and the member of staff on check in sang a full rendition of happy birthday to her much to my young sons amusement our son is and daughter less than a year but not once did they feel anything other than welcome by the staff even tv put on in a special kids area for breakfast if you wanted to use it extra perk was if you had already booked breakfast with your stay you can have it in your room at no extra cost turned up on a trolley which then was erected by the staff into a full table in our room dine in style and comfort from your own bedroom ideal after a night out
