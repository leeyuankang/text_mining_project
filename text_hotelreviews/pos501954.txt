with only one exception the staff were absolutely great from the reception desk to breakfast staff the concierge desk and the doormen all went out of their way to be helpful and they were obviously keen to give good service the staff in the japanese restaurant couldn t have been kinder to our unexpected young guests who had a two year old child the breakfast service despite huge demand was impressive in its cheerful but brisk management the location of your hotel would be hard to beat with easy access to westminster bridge the thames westminster downing st waterloo station underground stations and plenty of bus stops
