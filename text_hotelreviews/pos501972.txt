the layout of the room was good for people had hair dryer iron etc asked for more cups milk tea coffee was delivered to room immediately staff were friendly helpful hotel is next to waterloo station westminster bridge making it easy to get to everywhere would definitely stay again recommend to others we didn t have breakfast as not included quite expensive although it looked lovely
