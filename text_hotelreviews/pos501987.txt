very clean nice location excellent service when i called asking for replenishing coffee and tea bags they brought it to me very fast and someone called back to make sure i recieved what i want i was so impressed the studio has a microwave kettle water heater and a small section in the fridge separate from the minibar area so we dont have to move a thing from their stuff
