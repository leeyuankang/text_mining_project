the hotel is incredibly handy to earl s court station we loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet g t at the end of each hectic day in london we ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located there was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing we ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well
