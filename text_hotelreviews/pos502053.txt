it was fantastic the bed was fluffy and comfortable the view was internal but if you re staying in london you re not going to be spending much time at the hotel the staff were so helpful and friendly amazing location just minutes walk from big ben the london eye and buckingham palace the restaurant is very good and the bar is very nice their wine selection is heavenly i highly recommend this place
