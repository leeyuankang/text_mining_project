we loved almost everything at this hotel the location is perfect you can walk to a lot of places and if you need to take the metro or bus they are less than minutes away we upgraded to suite with city view and had a partial view of the london eye the upgrade was very much worth it compared to the room with an internal view everything was clean and comfortable totally recommend
