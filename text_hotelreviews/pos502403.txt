when i complained about to customer desk manager hajer she was not nice to say the least blamed me in such booking sure i liked accessible room new about and and booked it myself when i asked a piece of paper and pen to write down her name she rejected and started to cover her badge by hands just outrageous behavior however i still managed to see remember her name anyway i paid about per night to suffer night in this hotel great hotel for accessible room type i would sudgest to everyone who still trust and use booking com to carfully check the detail of their booking and to not rely on the normal default room type really bad experience overall
