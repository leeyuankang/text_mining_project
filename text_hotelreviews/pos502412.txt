we were greeted as soon as we entered the building directed to the check in desks by a lovely gentleman there was a error on our booking reagarding the number of guests but this was dealt with straight away with no trouble when we arrived in our room my daughter was thrilled to see a card a very large piece of cake was left for her birthday they had even gone to the trouble of leaving plates knives napkins the room had everything we required more very clean good quality refreshments toiletries we will definitely be visiting again we have already recommended this hotel to friends
