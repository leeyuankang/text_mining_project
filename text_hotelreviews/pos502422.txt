we love almost everything about this hotel it is located directly in front of big ben london eye is also very near by close to a tube station so it was very easy to get around town right in front of the hotel you also find a bus stop so getting around london from this location is very easy the room is really nice it has high quality finish in everything simply put a superb hotel
