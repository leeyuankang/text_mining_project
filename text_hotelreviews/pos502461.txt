the hotel was just fabulous location couldn t be better it was spotless beautiful rooms even the internal view wasn t bad staff were very helpful and nice on checking in the member of staff took us to the lifts personally which was really nice as they were tucked away staff can tend to be impersonal in big places like this but they really weren t here every member of staff said hello to us
