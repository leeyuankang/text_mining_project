the hotel was in an excellent location and provided everything we required for our two night stay the rooms decor cleanliness and comfort were all of a very high standard whilst for some the cost would be quite acceptable and usual for a quality hotel in a wimbledon setting we could just about see it as value for money the stay however was most enjoyable
