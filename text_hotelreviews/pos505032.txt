the hotel is very boutique and is sumptuosly fitted out location wise it was fine for my purposes but would be harder for visitors without a car to get around as it is located on the common and not more centrally in wimbledon staff were friendly and helpful price was quite high but it was for work in london and i would expect to pay more here
