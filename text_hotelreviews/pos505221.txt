good staff and service the hotel was recently renovated so the room was very clean and well maintained we stayed in a suite and the size was quite good for european standards the complimentary breakfast was great and worth it the location was good as well not in the city centre but still a walking distance or tram ride away from the museums and other tourist attractions
