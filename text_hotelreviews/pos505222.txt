not sure we envisioned three very tall flights of stairs when we booked this hotel we stayed for a week and were surprised that they chose to give a long term guest the most inaccessible room the room itself was fine the breakfast was lovely the hotel seems somewhat short staffed as the women who checked us in was also the woman helping at breakfast and also carried the luggage both up and down the stairs she is a real gem and hope the hotel knows how lucky they are to have such a dedicated employee
