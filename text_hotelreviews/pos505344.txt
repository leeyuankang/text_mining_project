the staff was amazing this property is in an excellent location between trafalgar square leicester square and the warrick theater our first stop our first room was a bit small it was the room we had booked and the view out the window was not great when we inquired what else was available they showed us a larger king room for a bit more a night which was wonderful i have some mobility issues and the staff was excellent in making sure i was comfortable this room had air conditioning it was super hot in london when we were there elevator and was very well maintained being american i love my ice and they always accommodated my wishes ice was free in a small amount but we did tip our room was on the front side of the hotel with a view of the skyline even so it was amazingly quiet
