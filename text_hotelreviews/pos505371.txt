stayed here for one night on my birthday on hearing this when we checked in we were upgraded to a bigger room and on our return after a night out found a surprise birthday card and complimentary chocolates in our room staff went out of their way to be helpful only a few minutes walk to leicester square but on a side street so very quiet would definitely stay here again
