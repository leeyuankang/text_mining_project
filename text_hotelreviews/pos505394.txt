only an overnight stay therefore didn t use all the facilities nor needed to the staff were very polite and helpful the beds were extremely comfortable and having a hairdryer and iron board in the room was very helpful the breakfast was good also with a choice of full english continental of both i particularly liked being able to check in early and leave our bags after checking which enabled us to sightsee easily before our return trip home
