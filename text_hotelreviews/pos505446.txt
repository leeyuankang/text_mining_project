the location is fantastic most of london s biggest attractions are within walking distance the room i was in had a decent view i was given an upgrade free of charge the room had complimentary bottled water and tea it had an ironing board and a hair dryer all nice touches which did go a long way to leaving a good impression friendly staff valentina at the front desk was very helpful it s not a budget hotel at least by my standards i know london is a very expensive city but you definitely get what you pay for
