the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful it was a perfectly situated hotel in a quiet location but literally just around the corner from trafalgar square the room was brilliant and we were looked after so well i can t recommend this hotel highly enough and can t fault anything about it we will definitely stay here again for a central hotel in london it was just amazing
