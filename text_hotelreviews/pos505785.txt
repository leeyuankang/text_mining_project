a fairy tale experience the room felt fresh and new the style is classic but modern and was generously sized for an urban hotel the inclusive breakfast and spa facilities exceeded my expectations the staff were attentive but discreet overall a perfect place to go with someone or on your own for a retreat from the city outside
