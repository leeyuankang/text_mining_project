a really beautiful hotel with very attentive friendly staff we were very fortunate to be offered an upgrade from our junior suite to a stunning spacious river suite with an enormous very comfortable bed and a magnificent bathroom dining facilities were superb with some meals served in the room without a hitch then the spa was just sublime all in all we were blessed with a very memorable stay in what we feel is the finest hotel in london and possibly anywhere
