i needed to escape a hectic working life and building work at home so booked a late deal and i wasn t sorry i loved the size of my room the bed was enormous everything had been thought of even an umbrella if you needed it the bathroom was well laid out and high spec had breakfast in bed one morning which was excellent and made me feel very special spent hours in the espa spa the back massage facial and scalp massage were incredible all the surroundings were relaxing with lots of spaces to kick back and relax fantastic dinners in both restaurants i thought the beef carpaccio couldn t be beaten but the venison carpaccio was heavenly and well done for selling lobster thermador with thin fries perfect
