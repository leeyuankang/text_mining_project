having stayed at the corinthia for a week we felt that it is an exceptional hotel and well worth the not insignificant cost nothing is too much trouble and the staff are really friendly knowledgeable and helpful the room was very well equipped spacious and clean and the hotel s facilities are fantastic for such an opulent central london hotel it feels very personal and family run and this creates a very pleasant environment in which to stay we would definitely recommend it and look forward to staying again
