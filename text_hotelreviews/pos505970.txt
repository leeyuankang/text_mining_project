super nice hotel with a very friendly and professional staf we had a problem with our booking it was our own fault but the assistant manager ayesha did everything in her power to help us we were very happy with the service and the stay and they gave us icecream and stroopwaffels at the check in the neighbourhood has a lot of breakfast and dinner options at walking distance as wel as the subway to go to the city centre
