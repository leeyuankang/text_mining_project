we absolutely loved this hotel young hip and very unique it s a college student resident and a regular hotel all in one there are spaces to work collaboratively spaces to relax there is even a ted space where you can watch ted talks the laundry room was so helpful after almost weeks on vacation we also rented bikes from the hotel huge bike storage in the basement they even provide their own maps of amsterdam with recommended bike routes and tips of what to do on your way the room had very high ceilings which made it feel bigger it was designed as a college student bedroom with a desk bookshelves with great books kitchenette and many little great details room was spotless clean and so was the rest of the hotel absolutely wonderful
