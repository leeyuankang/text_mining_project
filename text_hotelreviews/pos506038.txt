staff were very friendly and helpful provided plasters extra coffee supplies and any information you could need about the city and transportation free ice cream on arrival was great too transport was very easy between the hotel and as the metro into the city centre is very closely located to the hotel rooms and the lobby look exactly as they do in the pictures online
