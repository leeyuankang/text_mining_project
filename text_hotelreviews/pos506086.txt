very comfortable room the staff was very friendly and the hotel was very warm the room had modern installations and was very user friendly the location despite not being in central amsterdam was excellent it s right next to a metro station that takes you quickly into amsterdam centraal or if you stop earlier you re at the waag take a nice walk over the amstel and you re close to the albert cuyp markt a further along and you re at the museumplein
