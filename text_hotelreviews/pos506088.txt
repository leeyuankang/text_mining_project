the hotel is done really well with good facilities and extra touches the staff are great easy going and helpful the on site bike hire made life even easier especially as the lady on reception then circled good places to go on a map and highlighted how easy it is to get there etc an altogether pleasant experience and would definitely look out for these hotels to use in future
