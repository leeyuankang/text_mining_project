very great hotel having everything even remotely required and with quite manageable price location may seem to be a bit remote however simple metro and tram usage allows you to travel to all possible common tourist location and back in just minutes all the things required are in the room like teapot coffee microwave refrigerator tv and even stove everything seems really neat and tidy a lot of restaurants in different price categories nearby plus neat little park if you prefer running or cycling
