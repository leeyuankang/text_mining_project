this is a marvelous hotel for us seniors the staff are wonderful very friendly and accommodating the room was spacious and comfortable the cleaning left a little to be desired but nothing awful just not very thorough with the metro stop just outside the door centraal station is only five minutes away with all the students in the area and the cute signage in the room we felt young again great experience
