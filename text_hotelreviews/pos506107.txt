the hotel was very nice the interior is very modern and entertaining let yourself surprise the staff is very nice and helpful the hotel is very clean and we had a comfy stay with btw very fast internet so we were positively surprised and will probably come back the hotel has a metro station closeby which we did not use because the city centre is not far away nice location nice neighborhood
