the location is brilliant right next to a metro station that has trains every few minutes right into central station the decor in the lobby is very cool and the bar restaurant area is also very nice our bedroom on the floor was spotlessly clean bed was comfortable and there was lots of storage and power points we didn t eat breakfast there but it did look good and we were given a card to claim two free drinks there when we checked in this hotel is ideal for people who just want somewhere clean and comfortable to sleep maybe not for those who like real luxury
