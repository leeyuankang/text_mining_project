hotel was decorated in a cool and edgy way i liked the everybody should like everybody flags the room was perfect bed was comfy nice to have a tv and plenty of space we had a top floor room which gave good views too no doubt our fave bit was the ping pong table loved that the tedx talks area was also a nice touch
