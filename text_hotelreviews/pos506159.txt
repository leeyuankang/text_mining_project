everything was perfect when we were booking we requested to be on one of the floors higher up to get a nice view and when we arrived we had been allocated a room on the top floor absolutely amazing view and such a lovely spacious room with a very clean ensuite went to the pool restaurant beside the hotel which was delish definitely recommend
