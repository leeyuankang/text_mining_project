absolutely love this hotel came back for the second time and will definitely stay here when visiting amsterdam again not even a minute tube ride from centraal station and a minute walk when you get off the tube the rooms are spotlessly clean full of nice modern touches to make you feel comfortable the bed was super comfy and the curtains completely black out the staff were very friendly at hand for all needs we hired bikes from the hotel which were fantastic and saved us finding somewhere to rent them we love it here so much have recommended to all our friends and would advise you to stay here too
