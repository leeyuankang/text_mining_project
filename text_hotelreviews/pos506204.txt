everything about the hotel is spot on loved the hotel and the way it is laid out no matter what age you are you can relive your student dreams there room was big and toilets were clean plenty of activities to do within the hotel itself i have stayed in brands like hiltons marriots plazas but this was different and better than those hotels by far a great place to stay very close to the central which takes minutes on metro staff were very helpful loved everything about the place and for sure will revisit the place no hesitation in recommending this lovely place
