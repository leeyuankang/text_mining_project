the coolest apartment ever we stayed in the playroom and it has everything you can wish for a dancing pole a sourrond system bar a huge lounge two bathrooms comfy and huge beds the apartment itself was huge too and it felt like your own night club absolutely perfect for young people and it was really easy and fast to get into the city center as the metro is just outside the hotel we definitely recommend the playroom apartment to everyone you won t be disappointed also the staff are young friendly and amazing and the hotel has its own restaurant and a modern gym you can use for free and it s a big supermarket just across the road if you need something
