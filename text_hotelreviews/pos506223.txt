everything else i would really like to stay here again the food was lovely and well priced lively bar lots to do in the hotel i wasnt well for a few days but i very much enjoyed staying at the hotel while my son went exploring lots of lovely magazines to read and i found the large foyers really comfortable to sit and do artwork it feels like a productive artistic space
