very good hotel a little bit far from the centre but it s super fast with the subway by foot is about minutes from the centre because it s not central there are a lot of cool spots around max mins away without many tourists the service was great the room was clean not noisy at all we stayed there only for days so we didn t use the common spaces but everything looked very good bonus points cool interior stroopwafles upon arrival
