the reception staff was really helpful and friendly they offered us cookies while we were checking in and the check out was fast and easy the room was nice the bed was comfy we didn t have breakfast but we really enjoyed the coffee machine of the room distance from the center is only minutes by bike and the bike rental is very easy and totally worth it
