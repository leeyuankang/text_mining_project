stayed here for nights driving across europe massive student vibes from this hotel the room was just like student accommodation or what you wish your student flat was like from the welcome cookie checking in to the muffin and water left in the room there was so much attention to detail the bed was magnificent lots of quirky books and posters in the room a kitchenette with hob and fridge we couldn t have asked for a better place to spend nights minute or so walk into central hotel does bike hire staff spoke amazing english and were so welcoming and friendly recommend
