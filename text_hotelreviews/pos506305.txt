we stayed in a suite which was lovely the room and all of the hotel was decorated nicely and the bed was very comfortable we were also able to check in earlier which was great the bicycle rent was very convenient as well and the cycling map in the room was handy the location was very nice not quite in the centre but easy to walk or cycle or take the metro which we didn t try i would definitely stay here again
