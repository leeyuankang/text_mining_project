it was wonderful to be in an environment where there was a mix of people doing different things not just tourists it was delightful to be mixing with students we felt like students ourselves again although our student experiences were not as luxurious the staff all young were wonderful all cheerful helpful and efficient the room was perfect for two people with all the facilities we needed great breakfasts and the meals at the pool were so good lots of multicultural variety that we ate there most nights although the hotel is out of the centre we quickly mastered the metro and tram tickets available in the metro station close by the supermarket across the road is excellent we would highly recommend this hotel
