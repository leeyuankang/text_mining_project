the hotel offed me a nice little single room that looks exactly like a college dorm room bed was comfortable and the whole room was clean it wasn t noisy and the location was great for me it s a minute walk from the city centre and is a minute walk from the wibautstraat sp metro station the hotel itself has really nice facilities gyms restaurants and something that looked like a room for video games and is very modern
