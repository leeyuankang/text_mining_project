great staff i got in to early after a very long flight and still needed to wait hours before i was able to check in unfortunately i wasn t aware of this and asked if i could get an upgrade to be able to check in straight away i wouldn t mind paying for it as i was desperate for a shower they upgraded me for free and therefore i can say thums up brilliant hotel stayed there twice now and i will definitely be going back thanks crew
