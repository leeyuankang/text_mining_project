location not really central but the metro stop is practically outside the hotel staff is great and really helpful they greeted us with waffles the first day it was my husband s birthday the next day and i had kindly asked a prosecco bottle as a surprise we found one in our room as a present from the hotel our room was on the floor with an amazing view of amsterdam very comfortable room the lounge has billiard and ping pong tables this hotel is like a real student house but wayyy more comfortable
