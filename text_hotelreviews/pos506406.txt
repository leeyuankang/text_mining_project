loved this hotel just what you need for a short or long break away all staff were welcoming and helpful the metro station is only a walk from the hotel which takes you into central amsterdam rooms are simple but very clean and modern we had a room on the floor which had amazing views of the city we didn t use the restaurant facilities however it was there is we needed it my boyfriend used the gym which was up to his typical gym standard vending machines are placed in the hotel along with photo booth and pool tables our flight was a late one however we were able to relax and wait in the lobby area still feeling very comfortable
