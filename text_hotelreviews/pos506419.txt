firstly we arrived earlier than originally planned and although we were supposed to check in at we actually arrived at around and the receptionist was really helpful and sorted us a room to check in early all of the receptionists and staff there are super friendly and helped us with any problems we had bar restaurant was really good too and has a nice area outside where you can drink and smoke metro station is literally down the road so it s easy to get into the city centre although the trains stop at so if you want to stay out later than that then you ll have to either walk or get a taxi will definitely be staying here again if we come back to amsterdam
