the staff are very friendly most of them their nice facilities such as the games in the downstairs lobby it s fun and a nice extra at the hotel location being right next to the metro station is great help the laundry system is great you can wash things yourself by using your own washing machine in the laundry room they offer downstairs and pay a small price compared to most hotels out there who rip you off with extortionate prices
