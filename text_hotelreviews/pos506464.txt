this place was amazing facilities to chill such as ping pong and pool also the wifi was great the rooms perfect size and very clean also an amazing view out of the window over some of the city there are numerous restaurants close to the hotel down by the river front i would recommend the tapas across the road the check in was the best one yet as we got a free ice lolly which won us over also recommend renting the bikes for riding around the city
