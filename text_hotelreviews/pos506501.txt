super friendly staff the hotel was great there were people there of all ages and backgrounds playing ping pong or just hanging out with friends or on their computers in the main area the lighting and ambience were terrific bike rental was super easy and affordable the room was super comfortable and i enjoyed the way the key activated the lights and turned them off when no one was in the room as to save energy i enjoyed the quotes that were randomly placed throughout the hotel someone put a lot of thought and care in creating this amazing hotel
