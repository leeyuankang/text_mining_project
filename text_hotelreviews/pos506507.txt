where do i start super friendly staff chic design nice breakfast great location just next to the train station about minutes ride to the city centre we stayed there for nights and can t wait to get back there again highly highly recommended great atmosphere also our room had a kitchen so the crew gave us tools to cook and of course the coffee machine that made our mornings nicer
