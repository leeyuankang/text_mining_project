the staff were so friendly and helpful on arrival in particular and throughout our whole stay the facilities were even better than expected after being abit apprehensive of the name student hotel but it actually benefitted our stay with extras such as the lounge area with the pool tables etc the laundry room was a fab edition too i ve never slept in such a comfy bed and the room was so spacious we were pleasantly surprised at how stylish the rooms were and we will be returning in just a months time
