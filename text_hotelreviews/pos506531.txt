i stayed at this hotel for my boyfriend s birthday from june it was such a great hotel the rooms were very clean and the stuff were ever so friendly it was only stops away from the city and only minutes bike ride you could buy all the train tickets and rent bikes at the hotel which is brilliant i would definitely stay here again if i was to visit amsterdam again
