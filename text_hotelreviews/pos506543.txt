this hotel was perfect for us we stayed for nights for a city break and found this hotel to be exactly what we were looking for the location was fantastic just outside the town but stops on the metro gets you there in minutes we hired bikes and had such a fun day cycling around the whole of amsterdam bikes were just euros a day which was great value it was our wedding anniversary while we stayed and they gave us a gift which was a really nice touch i would stay here again
