the location is great it is not in the center but there is a very good metro connection which takes about minutes to get you to the center this also allowed us to stay in a completely new modern and open minded hotel with great staff which is something i cannot say for hotels in the center of amsterdam based on other booking suggestions the hotel is metro stops from the central train station and metro stop or min walk from the amstel train station the amstel station is a better option if you are traveling from eindhoven via train the hotel provides free access to a number of services including laundry gym and multiple games in the reception area high speed internet is free everywhere including the rooms the restaurant is very nice although it was not included in the price of our room we asked for breakfast on the last day for euro person the breakfast was great lots of options and very friendly staff the restaurant also has great options for lunch and dinner the room was great it was clean modern spacious and very ingenious there were lots of small details that made our day everything was so welcoming the name of the hotel may be confusing but this is definitely not a student hostel the hotel is located next to a college so that would explain the name this is for sure a great experience if we ever go to amsterdam again we will book again the hotel is cash free so every service that you need to pay for has to be done via card we had no issues with that
