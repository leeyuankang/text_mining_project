i took my partner to amsterdam for his birthday with a few other friends we could not speak highly enough of this hotel it is only stops away on the metro to central station about minutes and there is a metro and bus stop right outside the hotel the hotel itself was amazing the decor was beautiful and we had the pleasure of staying in one of their brand new rooms the staff were so lovely and always happy to help with any queries we had about where to go or how to get there on arrival we were even given a traditional stroop waffle as a welcome molly at reception was so lovely and ironed out any kinks we had with our holiday
