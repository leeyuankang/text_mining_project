the location was perfect for me it was only a short trip from the main railway station very close to a metro station and away from the hustle and bustle of the town centre i also felt very safe as a young female solo traveller the hotel was very clean and comfortable importantly it got the basics essentials right i was very impressed by the staff they made me feel at home my room was cleaned every day and it was the only hotel i stayed in this trip that actually re stocked the bathroom with clean towels and toiletries every day this was important for me as i have long hair and i use a lot of shampoo it also was a sign of good will and made me feel welcome
