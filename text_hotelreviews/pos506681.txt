loved the atmosphere of this place very close to the metro which can take you to the city centre in a few mins staff at this hotel are amazing and very helpful you can hire a bike from the hotel for euros checkout procedure was one of the best i ve ever seen at the hotel where you just have to drop it off in a box supermarket just opposite and so many restaurants at walking distance
