the hotel had only just opened so everything was brand new all the facilities are great and there are table tennis tables and other games in the communal areas staff were amazing we travelled to amsterdam on a whim so wanted some advice as to where to go and what to see and all staff gave us excellent recommendations cohen greeted us with smiles and an ice cream on arrival located right next to a metro stop it is walkable to the centre in minutes or around minutes by metro would highly recommend
