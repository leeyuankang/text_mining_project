the staff and general atmosphere was excellent really relaxed and comfortable all of the staff spoke to us as individuals and took the time to actually talk to you rather than just perform there duties which makes a massive difference to your stay the room was clean functional and easy on the eye we loved our stay and have already recommended the hotel to friends
