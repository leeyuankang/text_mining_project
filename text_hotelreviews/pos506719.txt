i really liked this place it s a comfortable room with a lovely en suite it may sound a bit odd but i loved the bathroom good size and great shower i had a standard single room the bed was wider than a standard single and the room was a good size for one person everywhere is very accessible in the building and the metro station is directly outside of the main entrance there are a couple of takeaways close by and also an albert heijn supermarket across the road for snacks drinks etc
