i had the pleasure to stay at tsh for two nights on the same week they opened and it was simply great the building that was probably once a factory has been for sure recently refurbished and both the rooms and the communal areas you can find a lot of them where to hang out and meet other customers are brand new clean and welcoming the people working there really know how to do their jobs and were always helpful and super nice to us the city center is easily reachable with the public transports and by bike also it must be minutes it s recently opened but i m sure it will soon be by far the most known student accommodation in amsterdam
