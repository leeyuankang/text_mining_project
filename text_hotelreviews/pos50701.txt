i booked the classical room for one week in january but when we came the staff kindly upgarded the room for free as the period of staying was really long it was a first good impression so the room was big enough for two people clean and with a good view to saint honore there is everything in it you need for a comfortable stay towels are changed every day bath things are always at hand we opened the window but it wasnt noisy at all not quite still as it is the city center everybody i think refers to the location of the hotel and it s right it s excellent you cant have better all sights are so close to you that we did not use any transport the breakfast was european all you need to have in the morning eggs sausages many kinds of cereals juices a lot of fruits yougurts and of course bakery fresh and warm the service was perfect you got coffee or tea immediately i should say the hotel costs its price adn i will surely choose it next time in paris it goes with all needs of the tourist or businessman
