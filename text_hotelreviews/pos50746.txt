we really like the location of the hotel walk to the louvre and across the road from lovely bars and restaurants the staff were very friendly and aproachable and the hotel lovely and clean we had breakfast day when we were given a discount of and it was very good we wouldnt have chosen it for the normal though rooms were of a good size and nicely updated we also had a mini bar very handy they also offer room service but a bit expensive so we didnt try it we will return to this hotel
