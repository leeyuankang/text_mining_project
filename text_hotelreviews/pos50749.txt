small hotel with great location close to museums excellent friendly and helpful staff our deluxe suite on the sixth floor was fine for a mature couple staying six days no trouble sleeping although just to make sure we did use the sleep noise app on our ipad if returning to paris will definitely check this hotel first for availability and price
