there are many hotel choices near the vienna main train station now for the best access to the city transportation the hotel prinz eugen is still the best bet i was there early july heat wave and i was comfortable in the hotel and in my room the breakfast buffet is very good the staff are quick to keep the food trays full and the coffee is excellent i also liked having a bar for a wind down drink at the end of the day
