close to vienna main railway station and underground had a good sized room at the back of the hotel i thought it could be noisy being on a main road but i never heard a sound the bed was comfortable and clean breakfast was buffet style and included boiled and scrambled eggs bacon and sausage as well as the usual continental choices there is a small bar with some outdoor seating but no restaurant
