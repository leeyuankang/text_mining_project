very accommodating and nice service at the reception comfortable and nice room and beds nice interior in the style we sought older viennese style but not baroque good and sufficient breakfast excellent position regarding public communication minutes walk to the main railway station in vienna with railway bus tram taxi and u bahn tube connections to all parts of vienna and railway and bus connections to other parts of austria and abroad it is a short walking distance from the lovely castle and gardens of belvedere and further into the city from there however the first impression of the hotel when arriving from the station was rather chocking the whole area around this main railway station is an enormous development area with building of new huge public and private buildings all over the place including the development of a new neighbouring building very close to the hotel but forget this when you have arrived into the lobby all is forgotten a stay at this hotel is a very good advice for a very good stay in the lovely vienna
