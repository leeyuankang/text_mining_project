we got a room in the eighth floor it was spacious with lots of natural sunlight the bathroom was also large and clean it seemed like the clock had stopped somewhere in early since everything was old but very well preserved e g old fashioned crt tv sofa etc the room also got a balcony which we liked but could not appreciate much due to the cold the rest of the hotel looked even older it must be the same since the sixties and seemed like a joke when we first got inside but to say the truth this gave it a unique style which we liked the location was very close to the main central station hauptbahnhof wien so it was really easy to get there from the airport using the train the train station offered connection to the metro so you can get anywhere in the city
