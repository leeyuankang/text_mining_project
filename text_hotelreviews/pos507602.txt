hotel prinz eugen is located just a few steps diagonally across the road from vienna s new hauptbahnhof the interior lobby dining hall and room exhibits traditional viennese charm which is surprisingly not evident from the outside my room was cosy and had an air conditioning unit to regulate the winter temperature it also came with its own balcony the bed was soft and comfortable with suitable bedding the refrigerator and room safe were great additions breakfast was a simple and nutritious affair staff overall were superb though taking a tram or the subway would be the transport choice for most visitors to the city centre the minute walk allows you to admire the sights and enjoy an unhurried break well priced and with lovely hospitality prinz eugen is a definite pick for any future breaks here
