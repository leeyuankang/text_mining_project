we ve been there with our cat to participate to world show which was in vienna the hotel is close enough to the show hall and is quite cheap these were our criteria for choosing it has very good connections to railway station metro and tram buses the breakfast is good enough the bathroom was spotlessly clean the room was comfortable enough the staff was helpful they made it possible to take the room a few hours earlier than the check in official hour as we were with a cat and the cat was eager to use the bathroom sort to say on the whole is a very good value for money and even if is not in the city center you have good connections also the room has double windows doors to the exterior so is very quiet even with some traffic on the street
