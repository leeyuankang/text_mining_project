i had a short stay at nh one night but everything was clean and comfy not very close to the city center but within walking distance i am a walking enthusiast but i think others could enjoy the walk as well it s about km i think very close to the subway and easy to find the staff was friendly and i liked the mint cucumber infused water you can drink at the reception all in all i had a pleasant stay and i would return even for more than one night
