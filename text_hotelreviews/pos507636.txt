the hotel was very close to public transport stops however i also found it a pleasant walk into the inner stadt of vienna it was very clean and there was plenty of choice for breakfast wifi was good the area is being developed with a new contemporary art gallery literally just across the road and part of the belvedere palace group overall i d stay here again
