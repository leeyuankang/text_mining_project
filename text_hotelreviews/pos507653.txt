i stayed here for nights and it was perfect it s situated minutes away from the train station and also just around the corner from the tram line d which takes you into the city centre my room was spacious and comfortable i noticed it didn t have a minibar in the fridge but i wouldn t have used it if there was so no problem there the inclusive breakfast was fantastic with such a wide choice there must be something to suit everyone all in all a great base for exploring vienna and i d definitely stay here again if i return
