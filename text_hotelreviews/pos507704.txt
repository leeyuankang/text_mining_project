location to wien hbf main station room surprising well sound insulated from outside noise and given how busy the main road is and that i was facing that way i was not disturbed at all also bedroom had an inner door which when shut cut down on noise in the corridor as well so a good night sleep was had breakfast buffet is very varied i have stayed here some years ago before the days of booking com so i had a good idea of what to expect anyway
