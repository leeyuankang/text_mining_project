the staff was by far the best thing about this brilliant hotel the level of service was incredible to say the least better than anywhere else i ve ever stayed ibrahim was a delight to talk to in the bar area when my girlfriend was very poorly with a severe case of sinusitis we asked if we could prolong our checkout time until our train back home emanuel at reception was immediately able to help us he not only let us stay in our room for the extra few hours we needed but he also did not charge us a penny for it either this to me indicates an exceptional level of service he should be rewarded for it accordingly the whole staff was extremely helpful the management should be very proud of everyone who works there on top of this it s also an absolutely delightful place to stay close to hauptbanhof it is a nice pleasant walk into vienna city centre on foot from the hotel it has comfy clean rooms provides a very tasty breakfast i genuinely cannot find any major faults about this superb hotel it also has a very interesting cool art deco decorated interior very pleasing to the eye one minor niggle would be that the beds were too soft for me but that s just a matter of personal preference that s why i cannot give the hotel a full out of unfortunately stay at this hotel you won t regret it i will definitely be recommending this hotel to everyone who would like to visit vienna one day
