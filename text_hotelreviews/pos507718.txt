it was a short easy walk from the railway station and two blocks away from the tram d that goes into town the room was clean and comfortable with a reasonably sized bathroom the breakfast spread was more than ample the hotel foyer is reminiscent of a majestic old building it is also only two blocks away from the belvedere which is absolutely stunning there is a laundromat within walking distance there is a supermarket and eateries in the station and a few restaurants just down the street
