the location was highly accessible to public transport and catching train to the airport and the staff were very helpful and the breakfast was substantial i particularly liked the very new bathroom for such a boutique hotel walking distance to the belvedere palace and a tram ride to hundertwasser museum made this hotel the perfect choice for my stay
