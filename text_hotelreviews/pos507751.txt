location i like that it is situated right next to haupbahnhoff where i could board the train and leave for czech republic the metro might be quite a distance but its all healthy walking get a day pass and feel free to explore what vienna has to offer the belvedere palace is just around the corner hotel itself the lobby looks lovely and the staff were quite friendly i also enjoyed the breakfast buffet as many hotels would not have provided it at this price point
