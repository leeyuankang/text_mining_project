the staff are all lovely people friendly helpful professional the wifi is reliable and fast the breakfast is excellent a wide selection fresh and tasty the room was quiet everything in the room worked well the shower was good as was the television the hotel has a welcoming homely atmosphere which is nice to return to after a day out it retains a historic charm while being fully modern i certainly intend to stay here again and i fully recommend this excellent hotel
