great buffet breakfast lots of variety and swift service clean and comfortable bedroom and ensuite bathroom good hotel restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and good range of traditional austrian dishes at reasonable prices the hotel s location is ideal most things are within a walkable distance of about but there are bus and tram stops right outside the hotel if you don t want to walk and taubstummengasse underground station is just minutes walk round a corner behind the hotel the hotel sells and vienna cards from their reception desk covers free transport and discounted admission fees to attractions the wieden area is ideal plenty of cafes restaurants takeaways supermarkets pharmacies it feels like a proper community with everything you might need within a stone s throw of the hotel there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom but reception will provide them free of charge if you ask the hotel s staff really shine so friendly helpful and accommodating yet extremely professional i would definitely recommend this hotel great location and excellent value for money a very enjoyable stay thankyou
