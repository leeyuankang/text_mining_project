my second visit the first as a couple with lady companion this time solo the location of the erzherhog rainer is spot on being a short walk from karlsplatz u bahn which is a hub connecting to a very efficient metro system stefansdom and the museum quarter are minutes walk away in the opposite direction the belvedere palace is a short walk away the hotel itself has efficient and attentive staff my bedroom was functional and comfortable breakfast is excellent served between and the first day i arrived for breakfast solo at to find there was no room bar an uncomfortable looking high table which a member of bar staff tried to fob me off with issue resolved by arriving for breakfast at the remaining days and on my final day there are some very good eateries within walking distance of the hotel if the hotel s restaurant is busy
