location of hotel excellent on quiet street with a small park on one end with a nice italian restaurant on the side short walk to the taubstummengasse stop closest to the hotel with easy access to the whole excellent subway system delicious buffet breakfast with wide variety of foods and efficient friendly service would have liked better croissants but assortment was good the room was clean beds very comfortable and bath was small but efficient with a nice heated towel rack perfect for drying even heavy winter socks temperature control for the room was perfect as we prefer a cool bedroom for sleeping but a nice warm bathroom when we get up excellent bargain for the price
