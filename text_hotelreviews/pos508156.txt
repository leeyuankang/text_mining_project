staff were welcoming and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable with everything i needed hotel itself has lots of character which seems fitting for a trip to vienna i enjoyed the breakfasts good food lots of choice and attentive service the location is also very good not in the centre so not too noisy but with good tram and underground connections close by if you re happy walking its maybe minutes to the centre and you can easily detour through other interesting areas such as the naschmarkt schloss belvedere is also within easy walking distance and its easy to get to the main train station for trips further afield the room was very warm but it was easy enough to cool it with the provided fan
