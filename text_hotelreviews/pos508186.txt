everything at this hotel was brilliant it has now joined the list as one of our favourite hotels the hotel itself has a very interesting history the staff were excellent from check in to breakfast to servicing the room we had a lovely comfortable and spacious room at the back of the hotel so nice and quiet the hotel is about mins walk from the centre very close there are plenty of lovely restaurants around if you d like to eat locally lots of shops and supermarkets too if you want to pick up snacks breakfast was excellent with a great variety of fresh food my favourite thing was the fact that if you wanted you could have a tea and coffee making facilities tray brought to your room i was disappointed as an irish tea drinker not to find one when i arrived but on reading the guest information found out that i could ask for one happy caffeine days
