the breakfast was excellent with the variety and display a feast for the eyes the tummy staff were very attentive professional they moved about the room quietly clearing resetting tables with a minimum of fuss some hotel staff in other hotels seem oblivious to the noise they make when collecting dishes setting tables the ambience of the dining room was lovely reception staff were also very helpful friendly
