the staff were all friendly and courteous and spoke good english i had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent in terms of quality and service the location of the hotel is great a short walk to the centre and also near tram and metro stops but my room was very quiet and comfortable so i slept very well huge buffet selection at breakfast
