this hotel has a really great location and is very well connected the closest metro stop is minutes walking distance we actually walked to belvedere which is about minutes away so if you re in vienna for sightseeing i can really recommend it much less noise and you re two metro stops away from stephanplatz the staff was cordial professional and made us feel welcome at all times keep in mind that it s an old school hotel even the doors open with old fashioned key forget magnetic cards so if you re into modern hotels it s not a place for you with that said it s been renovated quite successfully and overall was very clean wifi was free and quite stable and fast compared with what you usually get breakfast was plentiful and comfortable finally it s absolute value for money ps i won t list as a con but keep in mind that the hotel doesn t have a c which may be a problem if you re visiting during the hot summer months
