the location is great both quiet and at a walkable distance from several important sights not far from the centre plus easily accessible public transportation the staff is wonderfully efficient friendly and helpful the atmosphere is really nice rooms and the whole hotel furnished in good taste breakfast is delicious and of great variety i haven t stayed at many hotels yet but this is definitely the best i have ever been to
