great location in a real neighborhood you can walk to the ring in about minutes and there is a tram stop nearby we appreciated the parking garage and the great warm gluten free rolls they had on hand for my husband s breakfast there was a good variety of items at breakfast too the staff were friendly and helpful and we could leave the car in the garage for two hours after we had checked out
