we found it excellent all round hard to see why anyone would grumble unless one had an unusual experience all staff we dealt with were pleasant room was as clean and tidy as you would want we had a rear room but altho it has trams the main road isnt as busy ie noisy as some would make out and the glass is double glazed so i wouldn t be too scared to try a room facing the pretty street if you like a hotel near stuff but on the edge of the old town rather than in it this is bang on have a pint of splendid helles at the brewery around the corner then grab a bike at the city bike stand away so so easy to use and mostly free and wobble your way to check out hitler s weird flak towers
