the room was very quiet facing the yard but that s what we asked for i enjoyed a cup of tea in bed as there are coffee tea facilities and microwave oven in the room breakfast was tasty not such variety as in big hotels but it was ok and cappuccino was very good the location for theatre an der wien is walking distance there are even closer hotels but more expensive it is just minutes from the subway the tram even closer that takes you everywhere
