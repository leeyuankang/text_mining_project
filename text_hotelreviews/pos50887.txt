i regularly stay at several nearby hotels because they are on my company s approved list i loved the design of the indigo its much more funjy than the tower guoman i never use hotel gacilities so i can only judge this place on its room and reception and employees all of which were top notch i loved havinf a walk in shower rather than stepping into a bath with a clingey shower curtain everything was clean i didnt try any of the multimedia facilities but the rorms have an ipod dock and a big tv location wise this is perfect for me as i work in the city theres very little to do in this area after work hours but what there is is on the doorstep of the hotel min walk from aldgate tube tourists could visit the tower of london from here in mins walk and also mooch through the city taking in the cheesegrater the gherkin the lloyds building and the bank of englad all walkable all in all a great experience well done if i can get this hotel on the corporate books then i will be recommending colleagues to use it
