conveniently located nearby the center of vienna km parking on street was free in the weekend saving us euro thanks to the information the receptionist gave us excellent for us for the one night transit but i think it is good also as a base for a few nights to enjoy vienna not too much traffic on the street wifi worked well the bathroom also in good condition and everything was clean
