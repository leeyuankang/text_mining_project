this hotel is really deceptive from the outside it doesn t look like much and the lobby is really small however the rooms are a good size and exactly as they look in the hotel photos they are really clean and comfortable and quiet a good nights sleep is guaranteed the best thing about this hotel apart from the rooms is the staff they were so friendly and helpful and really went out of their way to make my mum feel special on her birthday so thank you the location is fabulous i d recommend staying here for anyone who wants a comfortable base to explore the city
