the hotel is easy to get to and in the weekend a lot of single yellow lines the rooms are spacious and a free mini bar helps its only a couple of soft drinks and snacks but every little helps where your hungover lol got breakfast in bed and was very very nice food for the area the price was cheap highly recommend
