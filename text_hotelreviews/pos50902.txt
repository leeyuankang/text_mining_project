stayed for nights for my husbands birthday didn t get any sleep on the first night due to a domestic in the room next door banging shouting screaming crying slamming doors throughout the night at we approached them to ask to keep the noise down were confronted with a barrage of abuse by a staff member finally asked the guest to calm down needless to say we were exhausted ruining our planned day trip i have sent a formal complaint but have yet to be contacted by the hotel weeks later definitely was not worth the price we paid
