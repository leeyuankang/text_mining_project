i came to vienna for my birthday and i really appreciate this hotel and its stuff for letting me stay at room until late evening free of charge when the weather was really cold they presented me a birthday cake at breakfast when they had known about my birthday it s so touching i liked my small single room you have everything you need in it and warm floor in bathroom you know it s just amazing when you come back from winter cold
