location is fabulous for running in hyde park shopping catching up with friends loved the personal touch and upgrades when the staff knew it was my birthday thank you so much i m an efficient female solo traveller so i like the nice comfortable feminine touches but i also don t want to be over whelmed with staff over attending me and the team here knew the fine balance of great efficient service to suit my needs within a day of my stay
