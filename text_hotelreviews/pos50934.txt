the staff at reception were friendly and helpful everyone we passed on our way to our room said hello the room was lovely and clean and had a free mini bar holding snacks and soft drinks which we really appreciated the hotel went out of its way with the little extras that make the difference such as a free paper and welcoming staff the location is great
