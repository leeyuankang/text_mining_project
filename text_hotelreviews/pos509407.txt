the room was so small that i had no room to unpack my case the bathroom was impossible they moved me to a bigger room as they moved many other guests as many of the other guests were complaining too they gave me a free coffee the lifts didnt work for a day so we all had to walk on the third day i took the lift and we all got stuck in it for minutes i tried to move to another hotel but they would not let me so i left a day early very bad rooms clean but impossibly small when i got stuck in the lift no one apologised and the manager was very grumpy and rude
