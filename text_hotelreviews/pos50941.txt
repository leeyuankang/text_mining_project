great location close to tower hill and aldgate stations amazing staff friendly polite and very helpful good size rooms with hardwood floors and superb shower tea and coffee facilities are great the minibar with complimentary chocolate bottled water and soft drinks is a treat it is the cleanest hotel i ve ever seen the windows isolate any noise from outside so the rooms are very quite and peaceful since it is mainly a business hotel there no screaming children or loud groups of friends in one word perfect
