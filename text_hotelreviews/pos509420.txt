the room was small but comfortable for our needs the hotel was lovely swimming was per day which we took full advantage of to relax after a full day in london not as described in booking com they said per visit which we thought was too much the staff were all very helpful and another added touch as the trip was for my birthday was a little cake and birthday card in our room much appreciated all in all we had a lovely few days would stay again
