the location is wonderful you are one block from the tube and the neighborhood is posh and lovely there are shops and restaurants very close by but at the same time there is a quiet relaxed atmosphere to this part of london if you are athletic beautiful hyde park is nice walk away in addition this hotel has quite a large staff someone is always there to quickly respond to your issue the concierge desk in particular was excellent
