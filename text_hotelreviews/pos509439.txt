the motel was very modern and the restaurant was exquisite the breakfast buffet was fabulous but the lunch and dinner menu had great choices and the food was full of flavor the bed was comfortable and the ensuite was really modern it was a beautiful place and i thought the world of them because they helped those impacted from the fire and gave accommodation to those that needed a place
