fantastic staff comfortable beds great breakfast buffet that had absolutely everything even vegetarian sausages for vegetarians a starbucks cafe in the building that was open no matter how early or late we got there plenty of power outlets everywhere in the room even separate usb outlets in the wall loved that detail also loved that we could open the window to get some fresh air not always the case in some hotels food in the restaurant was just perfect and at reasonable prices working space and a nice modern environment down at the starbucks corner on the first floor loved everything about this hotel mostly the staff that was always extremely polite and always smiling
