when we booked in they didn t have any twin rooms left so to my surprise they sent up the hotel staff to separate the king size bed and remake them into two singles for our comfort at absolutely no extra charge again we ordered room service after having had a long journey and it was delivered in less than a half hour hot and delicious the bed was ultra clean and comfortable and after our previous experience this was absolute heaven
