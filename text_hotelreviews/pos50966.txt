staff were great and very kind and considerate towards us the rooms were clean and tidy and very comfy not to mention beautifully decorated the location was excellent only a few minutes walk to aldgate station and tower hill nearby short walk to brick lane but plenty of bars and restaurants nearby we definitely recommend you try the thai restaurant next door it was delicious and so gorgeous inside we stayed here to enjoy harry potter studios and to visit camden for harry potter studios we went from aldate to euston via the victoria line i think and then from there via train to watford juxton where a bus took us to the warner brothers studio for a return fare of
