quiet ambience and boutique feel but central location and excellent amenities brilliant view from suite of the gherkin shard and other skyscrapers friendly staff delicious breakfast and a very comfortable stay overall very short walk from aldgate or tower hill tube station will definitely earmark for a return visit next time i am looking for a city break
