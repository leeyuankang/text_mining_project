i suppose as a chef myself and working in the hospitality industry for nearly years i am a bit more critical than most in some aspects my first disappointment was on arrival not being notified of the changeover in hotel names so arriving and finding holiday inn instead of kengsington close i first taught i was at the wrong hotel reception was caotic my reservation wasn t on the system and found staff unapologetic in such case my first impression was not great to say the least however as i do suffer from allergies and when requesting certain items from the hotel the staff was very diligent and accommodating i did feel the single room was extremely overpriced for the basic it contained but i will allow for the location which was fantastic would have loved to have been greated in some aspect of my stay by an english accent as i felt i at times was staying in an easten european city instead of the centre of london at times by the accents however most were very kind but when you hear staff speaking among themselves in there own languages can be very unnerving and intimidating to say the least overall as much a i had a lovely stay location being the most advantage to be honest i would doubt a return to this hotel again from working in this industry i am probably more critical than your adverage customer to me it was in many ways of star standard but as i m sure as it s a new venture for a new company best of luck in the future ann marie
