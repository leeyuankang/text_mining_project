arrived on a bad day i think as hotel was literally just changing over from kensington house hotel to holiday inn there were massive queues to check in and a few room mix ups and other problems as systems were changed however the staff were polite and as helpful as they could be under the circumstances plenty of room in the lobby and some nice seating areas
