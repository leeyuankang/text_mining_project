hotel was very modern very clean and staff very welcoming and efficient we had an upgraded room to a suite which was excellent we asked for a quiet room with views and got exactly that because we arrived late the curtains were all drawn and the bed cushions removed it is attention to detail like this that makes the difference value wise we booked last minute and got a great deal for hotel just mins walk from tower bridge
