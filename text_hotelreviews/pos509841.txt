perfect location and unbeatable price i have stayed here many years ago and also at the hotel next door copthorne tara both have ugly exteriors but you cannot beat this location lots of resturants shops whole foods tube station parks the room was perfect for our night stay small but that is the standard size in london i liked the bath shower although the bathroom was narrow the bath was still big plus there was an amazing smelling shower gel soap
