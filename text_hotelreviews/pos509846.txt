very clean lots of room friendly staff very quick room service me my partner stayed in the kensington close hotel for a midweek break to london we found it was good value for money quite posh without being pretentious the staff were always happy to help and always had a smile uber pick up right outside but cabs were always outside for fares i would recommend staying in this hotel
