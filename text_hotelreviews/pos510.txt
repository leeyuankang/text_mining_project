this hotel was a great value near the tube station in earl s court it was one of the few places in london that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter it was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything there was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring
