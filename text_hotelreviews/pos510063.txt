the room was small but very clean however the pillows were not star the room was a little dated but for the price we paid for room only it was excellent value in a great location for access to transport especially buses and underground direct into the city centre the location was peaceful and very safe for two female travellers to stay in with lots of cafes nearby and very close to kensington high street please look after the homeless man who lives down from the cafe nero
