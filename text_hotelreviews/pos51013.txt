the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was ready on arrival despite being a little early the room decor was great and the room itself was immaculately clean and well maintained the free wi fi was pretty good and the complimentary nespresso soft drinks and snacks were all restocked on a daily basis can t comment on the restaurant as i didn t eat in there during my stay fantastic location right around the corner from aldgate tube stop and some really good bars and restaurants within walking distance
