the location was fantastic perhaps a two minute walk to a good tube station on two lines there are a couple of other tube stations within walking distance in case of track maintenance etc we found it easy to get a taxi outside the hotel at most times of day also within walking distance are good restaurants takeaway shopping and facilities such as laundromat etc good facilities in the spa and gym staff were friendly and helpful and the room service was fast and reasonably priced for london
