nothing was too much trouble the travel cot was already set up in our room and there were plenty of staff at hand to help get the buggy up and down the stairs without waking our sleeping baby the whole hotel was lovely and clean decor was good and there were plenty of open areas to sit down entertain our daughter we thought the coffee bar was really good and they served great coffee there too
