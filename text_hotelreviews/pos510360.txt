great location only a few mins walk from high street kensington tube and on a quiet backstreet our superior double room was quiet very clean perfectly spacious for central london with a comfy large bed and small but nice bathroom with bath which filled very quickly nice and friendly staff didn t use the other facilities this time although the spa looked great very good value for its location and a nice place to stay would recommend
