i had stayed here a couple of years ago while it was going through refurbishment and had had to change rooms because the original one was terrible old and dirty but this time i got a wonderful room the first try i presume all of the rooms are now up to this standard the room was very clean the single bed was comfortable the staff and the hotel itself is completely good nothing over and above but absolutely no problems clean bedroom and bathroom good hot water and shower pressure the location is ideal very short walk up the road to the underground and to high street kensington shopping and minutes walk to hyde park no problems and a great comfortable stay still a little expensive but nothing compared to other hotels in the area and this is a proper hotel not a motel so the price was acceptable
