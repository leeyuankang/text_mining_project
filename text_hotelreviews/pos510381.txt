very good location close to underground transportation and busses very friendly staff spacious lobby where you can meet friends close to a hypermarket where you get a lot of fresh fruits veg and great food relatively close to hyde park close to shopping outlets including children wear which was very handy as we were travelling with a toddler who needed some extra wear
