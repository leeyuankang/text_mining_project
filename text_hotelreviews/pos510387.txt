on arrival we were upgraded to a room on the floor what a difference no comparison to previous rooms with a tiny bath and ridiculous awkward sink this was quiet spacious and proper sized sink in the bathroom and huge bed no bath but good efficient shower efficient professional and friendly checking staff good location for us
