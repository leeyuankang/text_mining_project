fabulous hotel in a great location staff couldn t do enough to help you apart from the spa staff who weren t as pleasant or helpful we had not realized that the spa facilities were extra and just wanted a quick dip in the pool before heading out again we went to the pool without any money and were told we had to pay there and then before we used the facilities it was an expensive dip in the pool at pound each we didn t return on our night
