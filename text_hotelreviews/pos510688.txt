the very helpful and obliging receptionists and the attention to my needs i asked to change my room as i don t like being on the first floor and they did immediately the room and the bathroom are super clean my only comment is that i think wifi should be for free at least in the common areas as already the room is a lot of money that would make it even more attractive
