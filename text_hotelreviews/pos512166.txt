the room was comfortable and the tv was good the bathroom was nice and the shower worked well and we felt safe it was nice to have access to a fridge we used it to cool our beers once we were used to where the car was parked it was easy to get things from the car the breakfast was too expensive to bother with but it did look nice close to the vienna tram system and the main road into old vienna
