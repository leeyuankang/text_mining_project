when we first pulled up outside the hotel my wife expressed a little disappointment there were a number of homeless in the area but in fact the hotel was ideal the receptionist spoke excellent english as did other reception staff and was very helpful our room was on the top floor and some way from the lift but the room itself was fine and looked out over a central courtyard above a shopping centre which was planted with trees we bought tea coffee from the hotel bar each morning but didn t use any of the other facilities the hotel is some way from the centre about but is only from a metro station so everywhere is easy to reach on the very efficient system
