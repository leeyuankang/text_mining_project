we stayed with two little kids and we were quite messy the personnel did a great job cleaning the room on a daily basis we had a nice breakfast there was a small fridge in the room and the teakettle was provided at request at the reception desk the hotel is relatively close to the city center if you like walking but the location of the hotel is not very touristic
