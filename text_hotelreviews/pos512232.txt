close to u bahn clean and comfortable room rich breakfast good selection of food the hotel was quiet good soundproofing the room was cleaned well nothing bad to say about the cleaners they were all friendly saying hello goodbye etc the bed was comfy and the bathroom spacious with excellent shower very convenient location next to a mall with a supermarket walkable distance to tram stops subway and to the busier parts of vienna we found no reason to get any public transport we didn t spend much time at the hotel because we were sightseeing all day but we didn t have any problems during our stay
