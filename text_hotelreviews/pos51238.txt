the staff was very helpful the room had a king bed and was perfectly fine size wise the room was not as big as a typical u s hotel room but everything is london is smaller we had two large suitcases and carry ons and there was enough room we walked to the westminster abbey a few times it was roughly a pleasant minute walk there are a slew of hotels out there for the same nightly rate that deliver a lot less this is an excellent choice in the booking com star category the victoria coach station is a short minute walk away additional minutes gets you to the victoria train station and the victoria underground station from these three options you can get anywhere within or outside of london we had an excellent stay
