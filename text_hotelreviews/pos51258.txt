close to both victoria rail and coach station about mins walk but not on a main road so it is quite quiet the rooms are spotlessly clean classical wood furniture and the beds are very comfortable the chef in the restaurant was not only a good cook but was very friendly i highly recommend his cooking breakfast was efficiently served by two waitresses both the cooked and the buffet continental food were delicious overall the staff were pleasant and helpful and we enjoyed our stay
