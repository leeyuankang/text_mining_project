fantastic quirky hotel within walking distance of most of the sights it is extremely comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly the breakfast choices were extensive and although expensive the room service menu was varied and well presented and served reasonably quickly any questions or requests made from the room were dealt with very promptly and professionally
