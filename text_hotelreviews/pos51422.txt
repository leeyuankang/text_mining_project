we love st gemain and the hotel is ideally located for the metro within easy walking distance to the louvre notre dame and jardins du tuileries the parisienne ambience is on the doorstep with pavement cafes and a huge choice of bars and restaurants the staff are all helpful and friendly and the rooms are a good size by european standards and spotlessly clean we travel from australia so a home from home is important fully recommended
