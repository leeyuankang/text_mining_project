the beds and decor were nice it was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night we chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request
