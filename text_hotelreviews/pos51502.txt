this hotel is located right next to paddington station paddington underground and london buses so easy to get around london and i love bus which will take you past oxford st regent st picadilly and down to st pauls cathedral the breakfast restaurant garfunkels is very good for both breakfast and dinner there are plenty of pubs and cafes nearby with tesco a short walk away the hotel also gives you a free phone which has an internet connection i used it every day to check maps directions and even made international calls all free very very useful and i was impressed the front reception was friendly and helpful there was security in the front lobby at all times as a solo traveller at the end of my visit i found this very reassuring
