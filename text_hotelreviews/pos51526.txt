helpful and friendly staff both in restaurant and reception although their system did not show the booking com reservation this was sorted out promptly and we were offered an upgrade from small to standard double and early check in standard room is still small typical for this part of london but well designed so easy to use and good standard of furnishing right next to paddington station but well insulated from noise
