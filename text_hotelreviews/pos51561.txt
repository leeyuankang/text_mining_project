the room had a blackout blind marvellous why can t all city hotels do this to stop light coming in when you re trying to sleep i was also impressed to see ear plugs provided though to my happy surprise the room wasn t noisy at all despite the location the only noise i got was a loud woman in the room next door hint please don t shout in hotel rooms
