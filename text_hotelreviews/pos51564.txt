i like the staff rupindra was very kind she gave us an upgrade to a comfort room as opposed to the one i ordered the handi included in the room was the exceptional quality it was a third party handy you could use for maps phone calls reservations questions an amazing little device and was big piece of why i regard this place as a true tourist hotel
