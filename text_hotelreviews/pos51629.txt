the most convenient location in london heathrow express minutes walk away run in hyde park in the morning great tube and bus links fast and cheap cab to oxford street and west end quiet rooms despite city location five minute walk behind the station and you can stroll along the grand canal to little venice the rooms are smallish but clean and comfortable and in line with the price much better than paris and who goes to london to sit in their room anyway
