the staff were delightful the location to paddington trains couldn t be better the rooms nice but super super hot how we suffered the air conditioning said but it was at least in that room and we were quite uncomfortable as a result we tried opening the window but the noise was unbearable with the window open apart from that it was a great stay with warm helpful staff so i hope they can fix the room temperature as the staff deserve a star plus award
