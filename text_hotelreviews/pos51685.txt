a minutes walk from paddington station so ideal for an early morning train to heathrow the trains to the airport are frequent and fast to depending on terminal so staying in that hotel is a good alternative to the airport hotels especially as it is just minutes away from central london s restaurants and attractions the room was very quiet at the back of the hotel and the bed comfortable with a choice of pillows including down checking in and out was quick and fuss free plenty of places to eat on the hotel s doorstep
