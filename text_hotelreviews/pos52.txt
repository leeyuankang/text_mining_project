the location in a quiet park with a great terrace the space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste the gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable it s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in amsterdam staff was very friendly and accommodating the restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
