this is a lovely hotel i would say it has a retro look and perhaps some would call it dated but overall it is a very attractive hotel that has been decorated to a high standard the rooms are lovely we were lucky to get the room at a special price and as a result i was expecting the rooms to be a bit shabby not so they are in excellent condition and very tastefully done location is great it is just above the paddington trains station
