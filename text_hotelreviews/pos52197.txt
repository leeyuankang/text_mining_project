the reason i stayed at this hotel was that i had to go to exeter early the next morning by train and it s a minute walk from the bedroom to the platform i have stayed locally before but the hotel i usually use is more expensive and not so comfortable i used the gym on arrival and the facilities although a little cramped were excellent
