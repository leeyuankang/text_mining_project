the hotel overall was great the breakfast in particular was fantastic so much choice and you can eat as much or as little as you like the hotel room was very clean very quiet and homely after a busy day on the streets of london it s nice to get into your room and feel at home it was incredibly handy having a tube station right next door as the missus decided to bring half the house with her and of course i had to carry it all
