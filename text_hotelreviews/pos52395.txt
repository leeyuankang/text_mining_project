fantastic staff we returned to this hotel as last time they treated us so well we were again hugely impressed the room is very comfortable and the amenities are super the location is perfect when arriving at heathrow on an intercontinental flight as there is a seamless connection on the heathrow express upon arrival at paddington station there is a lift directly to the hotel
