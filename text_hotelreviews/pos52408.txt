beautiful hotel location was amazing right at paddington train station just zip in on heathrow express and you don t even need to go outside i literally could leave my room and be on a train in less than minutes plenty of good eating options right at train station plus a little grocery store tube stop right there also felt very safe coming home by myself at night would swing by the station grocery store to get sodas for next morning snack has minibar but it has a little portion of shelf that can fit a few sodas i asked for quiet room and it was super quiet housekeeping was amazing i didn t leave my room until pm one day giving feet a little break and they still serviced my room it was always spotless i loved my little walker s shortcakes that they left every day liked the radio stations on the tv was the best absolutely would love to stay here anytime i m in london need to watch for the prices to drop
