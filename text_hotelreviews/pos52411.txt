lovely hotel adjacent to starbucks paddington station without going outside concierge desk very helpful maid service was outstanding daily we were ladies sharing one room for nights i took the cot which surprisingly turned out to be very comfy nice sheets towels changed daily plenty of drawer closet space felt very safe secure in the hotel and the neighborhood obviously great transportation links just outside the hotel
