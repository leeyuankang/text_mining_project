best location in paddington you have a direct access to the hotel through the rail station tube station is right in front the main entrance of the hotel and you also have an access through the rail station restaurants fast food restaurants money exchange office etc are all close by or in the rail station and a starbucks coffee is practically attached to the hotel staff very nice helpful and welcoming family room was bigger than we thought the extra bed was free of charge beds were very comfy we had enough space for three adults in the room room was very clean i would definitely book again a room in that hotel
