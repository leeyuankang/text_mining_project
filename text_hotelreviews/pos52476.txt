the hotel is very central and close to many attractions just few steps from paddington train station as well the underground station just down the street you can find everything you want such as grocery shops restaurants etc the reception staff were welcoming and helpful i was initially booked for a standard room and upon check in got upgraded free of charge to a bigger room as we had a baby and needed sufficient space for the baby cot the housekeeping staff were more than happy to clean our room even at around while we were away wifi connection was convenient and fast
