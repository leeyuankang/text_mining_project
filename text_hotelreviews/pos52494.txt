a decent hotel very well placed for people travelling through london placed right inside paddington station very convenient as i arrived in london after a long night flight with a lot of luggage and had a day to spend before travelling on by train the paddington hilton is very much the generic city center business hotel but provided everything i needed the staff where friendly and made a big effort to get me checked into my room even though i arrived really early
