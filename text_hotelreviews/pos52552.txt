we were delighted to have a free upgrade when we checked in and were very pleased with the reception staff the idea of a free upgrade is also helpful as it gives an insight into other rooms available to book i would give this hotel a very pleased the hotel is very central paddington station is just a few yards across from the hotel so you can start travelling around london almost immediately after you step outside the hotel we only stayed one night so we didn t get to experience all aspects of the hotel but from what we did it met high standards we would definately stay here again and highly recommend for anyone to stay here
