i travelled back from hong kong on business and arrived back at heathrow mid afternoon i decided to soend a night at this hotel to recover from the flight and chose it because i got a good deal on booking com and because it was right next to paddington and heathrow express the hotel has art deco features the room had a double bed and was very comfortable and quiet with excellent bathroom facilities i managed to sleep hours to recover from the long daytime flight breakfast the next day was included in the package and was excellent great service from hotel staff efficient and courteous
