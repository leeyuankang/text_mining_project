location perfect staff we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the park plaza building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel it wasn t the staff at the park plaza westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the park plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back they were all smiley and happy to assist us on the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright the lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready it was a quick wait which was fine no greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the spectrum bar it was and the bar was definitely not busy the difference between our experience between the staff from both park plaza hotels was just really evident that i had to put it here room superior room we stayed for our anniversary we got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels we were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night the tv monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc the bedroom and bath were just the right size it was not small but not too big as well we didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right mini bar was stocked with the basics we liked that there were extra pillows for us to use bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean breakfast good old continental and english breakfast
