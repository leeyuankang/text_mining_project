breakfast was awesome staff were very friendly and extremely helpful the bar restaurant was very convenient and provided great service loved the food and drinks they had to offer the bedroom and shower was nice i enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at park plaza county hall next time i m in town in terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily
