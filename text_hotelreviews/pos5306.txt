little extras made a big difference it was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable there were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved we were a towel short evening phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within minutes the location is superb minutes walk from waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the london eye the south bank a bridge walk to either westminster or soho we were on the floor we could have been in the country it was quiet no road or plane noise at all
