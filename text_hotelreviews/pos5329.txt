we had a corner room on the floor with two large windows spectacular views of big ben palace of westminster the london eye and the city skyline over the waterloo train station this location is awesome to go to all the southbank attractions restaurants waterloo train underground station westminster bridge and longer walks along the thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of pimm s at the southbank centre almost every night the room was spacious especially for a hotel in london and the bed was large and comfy this is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat the staff were super friendly and very helpful we didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel
