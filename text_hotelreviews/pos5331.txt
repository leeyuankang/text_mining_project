this is the first time i d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last from the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the italian restaurant i could find no faults everyone was very welcoming and friendly by london standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable
