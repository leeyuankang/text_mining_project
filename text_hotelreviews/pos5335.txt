we didnt like our first room it was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light we had continual problems with the tv volume everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume that was annoying the buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible they refunded our meal though
