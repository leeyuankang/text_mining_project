the location is great staffs r friendly and helpful we booked the family room and very luckily got the room on seventh floor and the beds r very comfy housekeeping cleaned our room well and sent us some spring water free of charge and i like the hot chocolate served in our room btw my family love our room a lot especially for its large space with a good value
