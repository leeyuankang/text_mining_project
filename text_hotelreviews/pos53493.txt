the staff were very friendly and helpful mike made us feel very welcome on check in we had booked for breakfast included yet we were offered continental this was a very good standard but felt a little disappointed so i spoke with the manager and he was very helpful and looked into it and agreed that we could have a full breakfast so the following morning i did and it was lovely the hotel was on a quiet road so a great nights sleep the location was ideal for hyde park and the nearest tub about min walk
