superb location starting with london eye and westminster abbey big ben and some more within short walking distance public transportation and train stops also very close ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation i guess staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting magda on reception our cleaning lady nadia and one member i think sarah at the breakfast
