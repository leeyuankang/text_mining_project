the hotel is very well placed for the albert hall kensington palace the design museum and other attractions in the area you can spend at least a day in the area without having to catch a tube or bus and when you have seen everything in the area it is not far to the west end by tube it is on a street sufficiently away from the main road so that it is quiet the complimentary welcome drink was a nice touch the room was spotless
