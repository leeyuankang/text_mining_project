the staff were friendly and welcoming the extra touch of the welcoming letter and the complimentary drink in the hotel bar were lovely our room was on the top floor it was small but cosy and clean and the view was quite nice its a short walk from major attractions such as the royal albert hall and kensington gardens there are also some great places to eat on kensington high street which is only a short minute or so walk from the hotel i would definitely come back
