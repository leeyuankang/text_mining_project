perfect location near westminster bridge waterloo mainline and tube stations and minutes to south bank promenade and the london eye close to all sights and facilities we stayed for nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the shard also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave clean comfortable and great for an extended stay great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers on site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants
