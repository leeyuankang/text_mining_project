we booked this hotel to stay over night in london after a concert at the royal albert hall and we re very pleased the hotel was very smart the staff were very polite and our room was very clean and had everything we needed for a good night our continental breakfast was more than adequate and included in the price we paid and the complimentary beers from the hotel bar were an excellent start to our stay we think we had very good value
