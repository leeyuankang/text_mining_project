had a great time in london we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the thames or an open bus trip the underground and train station are close too we did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces the weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day after each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening hopefully will visit again soon
