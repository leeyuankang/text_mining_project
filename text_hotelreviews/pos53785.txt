this is the first time i have stayed in such an expensive hotel you certainly get more for your money but then you are spending a lot o money so all the usual boxes are ticked it s clean water was hot beds were comfy but it was certainly luxurious lavendar pillow mist and bespoke chocolates it felt like a very personal service the room had an upstairs which was nice to give my friend and i some space the breakfast was fantastic watching tv in the bath was a novelty i imagine if you want exclusivity and to be treated like a vip it would hit the mark
