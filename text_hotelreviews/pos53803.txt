i was staying in london with my year old son who suffers with a rare genetic disease he requires tube feeding and does not eat anything by mouth i brought my own special pur es for his tube feeds and the hotel staff were so accepting and accommodating of my sons special needs it made my life so much easier to have this type of experience i loved everything about our stay here and feel very lucky to have had this experience in london we are a long way from our home in australia
