fabulous friendly staff we felt like we had stayed a hundred times though it was only our second visit my daughter and her friend arrived to meet us while we were out and were made to feel welcome and comfortable the bedroom was beautiful and very comfortable and we were both able to take some work calls in the gorgeous sitting room we were able to easily get to everything we needed in london it s a very quick walk to the palace gardens and shops we will certainly stay again
