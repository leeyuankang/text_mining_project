superb location staff were great from the reception to the bar i was there on business but always use the opportunity to have a look at a number of non chain hotels to see if its somewhere i may whisk my wife off to for a romantic weekend rooms were small but nicely laid out i wasn t happy with my first room as it overlooked some bins but after a call down to reception the welsh chap there ned i think was super helpful and moved me to a top floor room which was much more pleasant and a little more spacious if you want a great gastro pub head five minutes down the road to the thomas cubitt great suggestion from ned was a fantastic place to eat drink and people watch
