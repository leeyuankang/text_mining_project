the room was beautiful including bathroom facilities spotlessly clean staff could not have been more helpful or friendly we had everything we could possibly need it was a shame it was not for longer breakfast offered a huge variety appealing to adults and children all to such a high standard thrilled with such a lovely service ambience facilities and location we would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay again in the future
