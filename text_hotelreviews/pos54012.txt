location metro porte d orl ans mins away from there about mins to city centre room clean basic equipment no fancy extras towels smelled nicely not that typical washed out hotel smell comfortable bed ironing board had stains we had no noise from adjacent rooms but not sure they were occupied breakfast no tomatoes no cucumbers no bell peppers which is unusual if not a letdown pears apples kiwis available next to muesli bar croissants and baguettes okay but below expectation for france children eat free with adults still pricey we used this only at the last day before we left staff i wouldn t overrate this but people seemed to do what needs to be done but not try to really think of their job service wise things get done when you remind the staff but like i said don t overrate this it s still okay and this is not a grand hotel finally it s a clean hotel with its own car park located in a safe neighborhood and within reasonable distance to both metro station and city we d book this again have seen worse for more money
