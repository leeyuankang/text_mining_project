stunning interior designed rooms with lovely bathrooms and beautiful bedlinen located opposite south kensington tube so a very central location surrounded by cafes and restaurants great staff who were very friendly and helpful plus the hotel held our luggage for the day after checking out which was a huge help as we were not heading to heathrow until the evening
