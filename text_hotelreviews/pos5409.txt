the bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious we arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early the hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to waterloo or westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time we have stayed here before and would definitely stay again
