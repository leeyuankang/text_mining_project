everything this hotel is superb the staff are just so helpful there is even a mini gym i have unusual hours so unfortunately i didn t get to enjoy the absolutely beautiful breakfast including in the stay as often as i d liked to have the hotel is open which means assistance is always in hand the staff even took time to find out about why i was travelling etc therefore offering more of a personal service south kensington is perfect for that person who doesn t want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the city but be close to london it is a pretty town and nice and quiet the hotel is within a few steps away of the south kensington tube thank you to the pelham for a wonderful stay
