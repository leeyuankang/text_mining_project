even though i had indicated on the booking that i was going to stay for one night this hotel charged me for two nights they assured me that this error was going to be sprted out the following morning when i was checking out the gentleman at reception refused to sign me out and charge my card because according to him he was supposed to charge me for two nights i realised when i got home that i was charged double for one night to this day no one called me to rectify this or explain this to me i felt so violated and yes i will not recommend this hotel to anyone i know for them it s money before customer service would not come back here again
