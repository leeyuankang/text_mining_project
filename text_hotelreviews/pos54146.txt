we were so well looked after by staff nothing was to much trouble beautiful hotel was up graded to suite if only we had more time to enjoy it as we were only there for one night so spoiled during our stay this is the hotel for us for all future london visits to everyone at the pelham hotel thank you so much for making our stay that extra special
