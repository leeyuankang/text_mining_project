just loved absolutely everything about this hotel the architecture the beautiful interiors the comfortable beds the cleanliness the cozy atmosphere and above all the staff they were so accommodating and helpful they made us feel like we were home we had an issue with the air conditioning and asked to be moved to a different room we were moved to the most gorgeous room in the hotel spacious and beautifully decorated the hotel is ideally located near the south kensington station which gives you easy access to the tube you ll also always find a cab since they are stationed near the hotel the neighborhood is wonderful and filled with many restaurants and bars to choose from you re also only a walking distance from hyde park not only would i recommend this hotel wholeheartedly but i wouldn t stay anywhere else if and when i go back to london a marvelous experience
