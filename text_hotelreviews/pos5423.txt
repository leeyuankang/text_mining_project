the hotel is in a great location with close proximity to waterloo station it was very easy to get to the hotel from heathrow airport via the heathrow express and bakerloo line from paddington station the staff was very friendly and helpful for a hotel room in europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four we also had a great view of the london eye from the floor the children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their park plaza euros at the bar i would highly recommend this hotel
