this is one of most charming hotels where i ve stayed the customer service was outstanding my room was small but with all the niceties the food was excellent and i so enjoyed the leopard cocktail the location is ideal in central london for sightseeing and easy getting around by foot and via the underground i will definitely visit montague on the gardens on my next trip to london
