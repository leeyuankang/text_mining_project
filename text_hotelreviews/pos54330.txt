we loved the selection choices for breakfast especially the juice bar were you can juice your own selection of raw vegetables this hotel had a number of gorgeous areas to eat drink and or enjoy the live piano bar without leaving the hotel all the staff were very friendly and accomodating will definitely be coming back
