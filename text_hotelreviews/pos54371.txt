the plants were abundant and well cared for plantwalls and potplants e g palms and zamioculcas plants attractive dried flower decorations were to be seen in the foyer and public areas this is important for me as i originally picked the red carnation hotels because they won the award for the best flower decorated hotels years ago they then had beautiful big bouquets everywhere the present situation with potplants everywhere is very pleasant also the cook makes attractive food plates and tasty and good value the looks interior and food in short have improved vastly since i stayed here the last time may
