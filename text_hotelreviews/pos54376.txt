the staff is fantastic so friendly and helping rooms are comfortable and very clean on first look from the outside i thought it was just another typical london hotel but it is a true gem a great combination of new and old the location is also great next to the british museum and it is a five minute walk to russel square where the piccadilly line stops direct connection to heathrow
