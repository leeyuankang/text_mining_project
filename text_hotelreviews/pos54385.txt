breakfast and food in general are delicious staff at the restaurant are very very professional and friendly at the same time kudos to staff the lobby are garden and winter garden are cute i really enjoyed the atmosphere close to russell square station to which you reach with a short walk through a park by walking around minutes and stops away from oxford and piccadilly circus
