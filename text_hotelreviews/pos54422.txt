we loved the atmosphere we felt as if we were in a family home the lounge was so inviting the staff was the best we were in london to be with our granddaughter who was in school nearby so we had a lot of visits from her and her friends and we were treated so well our son daughter in law granddaughter s parents were also in london at that time so we really enjoyed the hospitality of the staff and lounge coffee and croissants delicious the room was small but had the most delightful window seat that overlooked the rear courtyard i liked the black and white decor it made the room seem much larger each afternoon when we returned the housekeeping staff knocked on the door to ask if anything was needed we would return
