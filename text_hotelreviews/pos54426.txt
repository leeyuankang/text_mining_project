from the moment we walked through the door we were impressed the staff made us feel so very welcome the room was beautiful and they have thought of everything it was actually a shame to go out the bed was so comfortable with high quality linen we opted for continental breakfast in the room at no extra charge which was very well presented and arrived promptly i couldn t fault the staff they made us feel like we were very important we would definately stay here again room was wonderful
