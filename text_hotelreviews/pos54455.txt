fantastic hotel the staff treated me royally from start to finish the room was beautiful well equipped and quiet which is so important to me as i don t generally sleep well in hotels the hand written card from the manager and home made biscuits are a lovely touch i wasn t expecting i was so relaxed that sleep was easy
