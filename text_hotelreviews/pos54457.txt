we were there for a birthday and found a happy birthday sign and a card in our upgraded room signed by all of the management the room itself overlooking the gardens was quiet and well kept the hotel ideally located the staff was continually forthcoming and friendly we also enjoyed the heated terrace next to the bar ideal for a nightcap and evening smoke all in all we are very happy to recommend the montague on the gardens
