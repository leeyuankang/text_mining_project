impossible not to like this hotel great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in we also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices the staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail we were initially booked into room which faces onto the westminster plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them to be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms we decided on a junior suite room which looked out on big ben county hall and the eye it did cost more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive
