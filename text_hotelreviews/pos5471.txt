we stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful great stay overall i would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as waterloo station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go
