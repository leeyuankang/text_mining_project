the initial rooms allocated to us were a bit small even to fit our luggage the front desk suggested we take a full suite with bedrooms and a large sitting room but at a hefty additional cost we decided since we were on family holidays and that we can all be at the same suite cost ceases to become a part of the equation checked out with an oversized bill but well worth the family fun times beauty and food of paris plus the nice spring weather
