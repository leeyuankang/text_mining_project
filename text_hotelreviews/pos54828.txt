the street is so safe with guards either side we were upgraded to a collection suite on arrival which we were delighted with mary on reception who checked us in and showed us around the hotel was lovely the hotel was stunning and the room was absolutely beautiful the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in the hotel is so central within walking distance of most sights and galleries i would definitely recommend friends and family to stay at the sofitel paris le faubourg if visiting paris you won t be disappointed
