the hotel location is excellent there is even a little bakery next door where you can have nice crepes bed was hard so great for my liking but the pillows too cushiony lumpy so my head was too bent resorted to sleep with no pillow have to say the cleaning was fantastic i felt i was in a new room every time i came to my room reception was always very helpful breakfast was nice
