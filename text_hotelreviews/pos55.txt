the hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing they even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when i emailed them about this when i first booked online this was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town it is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too i would highly recommend
