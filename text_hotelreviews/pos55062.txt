the front desk staff is very friendly and helpful when we arrived early our rooms were already available to us rooms we received maps upon our arrival which is always welcomed the location of the hotel was very good for us as we took the public transportation quite a bit to get out of the city centre the breakfast was nice the setting of the hotel the atmosphere was probably my favourite part it felt good the balcony rooms were also very lovely the rooms quiet and cute
