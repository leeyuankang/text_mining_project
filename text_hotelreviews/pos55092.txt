very nice interior design contemporary and cozy nice and efficient staff nice common areas bar lounge breakfast room library business room affordable suttle to from airport my room was a bit small a foot or two between the bed and the wall but it was clean pretty functional in spite of the small size and very well equipped including a real and powerful hair drier with a balcony and a nice view on paris roof top and completely sound proof from street noise that s clearly the best hotel i stayed in paris in that category i will definitively go back there next time and i already recommended this hotel to friends and colleagues
