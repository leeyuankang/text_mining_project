usually i prefer to stay at leading hotels of the world however this time i was with friend of mine and we were short of money we had to stay just for night close to laffayette area surprisingly the photos in the internet di d match with reality it s a great and cosy hotel stylish and very clean the location is ideal for shopping upon arrival we ve received upgrade on the room and we were so happy all my preferences that i ve stated in advance were taking into account we really enjoyed the state liked the friendly atmosphere of the hotel will come back again in terms of price vs quality its above expectations i do recommend
