i would not normally mark somewhere out of but as soon as we got there the staff were friendly and helpful the room was excellent there was a nice seating area outside where the wife could have a smoke while we had a drink when we went out in the evening there was a good selection of bars and restaurants within a short walking distance in the morning there was a good selection for breakfast we both had a full english breakfast which was cooked to perfection
