the service and staff were excellent and really stand out in this boutique hotel they were very helpful and attentive and would always greet us with a smile moreover not only did they speak perfect english but also other languages such as german the breakfast was very good and on the second day our order was already remembered they also serve breakfast on the room which is convenient if you are lazy or under time pressure the location is ideal being situated in the heart of montparnasse and very close to public transport even though we preferred to walk instead which is also no problem the rooms were very clean and there was a lot of attention to detail the bed was very comfortable especially the pillows were probably the most comfortable i have every slept on in a hotel would definitely recommend staying here and would visit again
