an exceptional little hotel all the staff very so friendly helpful and as it is such a small hotel the service was so personal my room was small but who comes to paris to stay in their room it had a modern chic bathroom immaculately clean and the most important aspect the bed was very comfortable there were even different types if pillows to choose from i loved that pillow so much i took the cover off to check the brand it was a tempur memory pillow but not the hard one will have to buy and the common area had the charm and atmosphere of a very elegant private sitting room lots of art art books cushy sofas and free hot drinks all day long
