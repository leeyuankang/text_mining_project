the hotel is five minutes from the louvre and the sienne so we could spend our time sight seeing not travelling the staff are friendly and helpful the reception is open hours so we could get back late without a hassle they also allowed us to store our luggage before check in and after check out for a few hours so we din t have to lug our case around on our first and last days the breakfast was lovely and plentiful so we only needed a light lunch saving a fortune in expensive paris the room was clean and very comfortable and quite big by paris standards it overlooked the rue des pyramides but was not noisy
