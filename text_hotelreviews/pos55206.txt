one of the only hotels i found that have breakfast included which was quite the price is also very good considering the perfect location and what you get you also have a mobile phone in the room which you can use to make calls and take with you since it has pretty useful to use the maps and internet while on the move also there are many recommendations of restaurants and places to go will definitely stay there again next time
