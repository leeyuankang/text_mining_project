this was a very nice hotel they made us feel very welcome here i had asked for the room with a view of the eiffel tower since we were going to be there on my birthday and they gave it to me i had already known it was not going to be a full view from the other reviews i read but i didn t care this was our first time in paris and i wanted it to be nice we were gone all day the day of my birthday and when we returned there was a bottle of champagne waiting in the room for me and a card signed by the staff i did not expect that the walk was not far from the eiffel tower and it was nice to get to see it light up every night from our room lots of nice eateries in the area and a wonderful pastry shop next door
