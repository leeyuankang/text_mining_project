we love this neighborhood in paris and hotel marquis is somewhere we definitely will come back for and recommend our friends even though i checked in days after my birthday they gave me a nice bottle of champagne and a nice note they actually wrote my name in chinese characters what a pleasant surprise the tower is just steps away lots of restaurants nearby and there is local market on sunday really nice area to explore real parisian life
