the rooms were nicely decorated and of a good size for paris mattress pillows and sheets were of excellent quality the hotel generally made a successful effort on decoration the toiletries by hermes were a real pleasure and a good choice the staff is very professional friendly and always prompt to help i did not like everything however from what i could tell by the way this hotel is managed i am pretty sure they will look at my complaint and fix the problem so i recommend this hotel
