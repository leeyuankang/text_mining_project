travelling to london was stressful as i had never driven into london before however it was not as difficult as i had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport the hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience i would recommend the last floor the views were fantastic from the balcony the staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive i can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good the sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip the london eye parliarment big ben london dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone
