excellent welcome we were a bit early and the staff made us feel at home with a coffee and a fresh juice the location is also excellent close to the place d italie and a range of public transportation options the room is a decent size it s paris after all and is well appointed including a nespresso machine for coffee in the morning the lobby restaurant area is great with a nice sunroom for reading or just hanging around
