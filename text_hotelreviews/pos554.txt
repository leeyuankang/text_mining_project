refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds we had the classic twin which like most london hotels was small but adequate we suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet location is great as only a block away from the tube with the picadilly line leading direct to covent garden and the theatres
