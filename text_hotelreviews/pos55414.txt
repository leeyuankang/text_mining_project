the hotel is a two minute walk away from an stop so convenient the toiletries from rituals were a pleasant surprise you ve probably guessed it from the pictures they did a great job with the d cor and the object branding and this is a case where the photos actually do the reality no justice my room and the common areas definitely did not disappoint in person the included wifi is strong fast enough very pleasant check in staff two very nice touches the separate wc and a complimentary bathrobe slippers set
