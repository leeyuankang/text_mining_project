the hotel is located in a quiet side street very close to place italie with its metro station and also close to gare de lyon restaurants are in abundance min in walking distance i came by car for business and there were parkings directly at the hotel in the street free from to perfect for me the hotel is fairly new and it excellent condition standard rooms are small but well equipped with nespresso machines which i loved bed is large and very comfortable lighting is excellent there are led reading lights at the bed and one can dim the room lights flexible many electric sockets available fairly large tv screens with international programs and good quality the noise protection of the room was excellent i barely heard anything when i was located on first floor towards the street due to a problem with the ac i was moved to the upper floor towards a large courtyard and here it was dead silent despite the hotel was pretty occupied being a frequent traveler i have to say it is very rare but absolutely great to have such a hotel where you can enjoy an undisturbed night especially in a metropole the breakfast was yummy espresso cafe machine fresh orange juice baguette butter croissant and good selection and quality the staff was friendly and helpful and solved the issue with the ac that had broken down over night by offering immediately a different room the location was perfect for me as my business was min away but if one is there for tourism most places of interest are within a metro ride
