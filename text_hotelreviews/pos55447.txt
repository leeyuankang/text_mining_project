staff was very friendly and helpful especially the gentleman at night sorry i didn t get his name enjoyed the decor of the room close enough to the city center yet far enough from the loud touristy areas of paris comfy beds had a problem with the plumbing the tub leaked and lots of water was all over the bathroom floor but it didn t taint our favorable opinion of this hotel good price for paris
