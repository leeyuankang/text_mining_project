we have enjoyed our stay at this small gorgeous hotel very chilled fashionable atmosphere clean rooms beautiful cozy lounge area helpful staff nice quite location with many cafes and shops within a short walking distance if you are driving hotel also provides you with a discount almost half price for secure parking across the road which is a great bonus since parking in paris is expensive
