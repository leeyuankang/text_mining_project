cosy boutique hotel with an excellent price quality ratio thanks to the attention to detail the tasteful decoration and very clean and comfortable bathroom eg rain shower choice at breakfast was limited but quality absolutely ok on top there is even a vinyl record player in the cosy seating area at ground floor ask no more
