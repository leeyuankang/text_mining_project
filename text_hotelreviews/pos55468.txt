absolutely stylish place new clean beautiful perfect quality of everything from bed lining to the toilet paper every single detail and element in common areas and in guest rooms were thought about by designer and staff pure deep colours on the walls old oil painting pictures which decorate every room and lounge geometric design of bathrooms toilets and accessories shabby old mirrors in the lift and all of that in a beautiful old building with high ceilings and big windows made me feel absolutely ecstatic and comfortable i did t want to leave the hotel so i highly recommend coq hotel to everybody specially for couples and friends and i definitely will come back
