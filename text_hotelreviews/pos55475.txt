staff was very forthcoming and helpful hotel is located very close to place d italie and metro station you re even in walking distance hour from notre dame de paris taking you via the rue de mouffetard and past the pantheon if you re up for a stroll hotel decoration is a pleasant mix of styles and periods breakfast buffet is nice and the coffee machine delivers very nice and tasty coffee s cappuccinos or whatever your heart may desire the only point we thought that might further improve the breakfast experience would be to have a slightly wider selection of available bread all in all we re definitely going to come back
