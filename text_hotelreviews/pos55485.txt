very nice living room boutique style hotel extremely cosy and nicely decorated and everything is still brand new as the hotel opened just a few months ago our double room was very comfortable with big and nice shower very quiet at night breakfast buffet with a small but very good quality selection of ham cheese eggs croissants etc at decent price around eur personnel was very friendly too actually everything was perfect for restaurants one would need to go towards rue moufftard area or to other areas in paris there is not much around but with metro just around the corner one gets around easily
