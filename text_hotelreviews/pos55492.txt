modern decor very clean friendly staff and access to cheap eats in the area we went to comme du vietnam probably times during our days stay were the major plus for us room is a standard size for paris compact but there is a really quaint sitting area in the lobby if u needed more space we saw ppl using the large table there to do work location easily accessible to the metro min walk however u will need to transfer to most tourist sites we found that on avg we spent mins one way getting to most places the underground path ways can be long in the stations hotel is on a quiet street felt very residential and safe even late at night overall the price vs value was amazing
