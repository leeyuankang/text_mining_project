the hotel was terrific it is well located in the arrondissement near the wonderful rue de seine and rue de buci the neighborhood is busy and lively but the hotel is on a quiet street the staff were all polite friendly and helpful the many extras like a welcome bottle of wine a gift upon departure heated towel bar in the bathroom and bedtime chocolates on the pillow were much appreciated it is an expensive hotel but worth it
