our stay in the hotel millesime was great centrally located in the nice street rue jacob of saint germain des pres where there are lots of bars boutiques and galleries the hotel is opened some years ago with recently renovation done last year so it looks very new and cozy from its elegant lobby the garden and courtyard to room decorations all make us feel much comfort and especially its basement breakfast dinning room was superb my favorite part of which the lighting and interior design make the room very warm and comfy staff are very friendly as well with careful sense of hospitality i would definitely recommend you to live in this property
