for me the is the most convenient location as i can walk to most of the sites i want to visit it s a direct line from gare du nord a carrefour is nearby if you want to pick up some fruit or yoghurt as well if you want a change from the petit dejeuner lots of beautiful places to eat at at all levels of price points the staff were elegantly polite and spoke perfect english which was a help for me very comfortable bed contemporary bathroom with rain shower and detached head over a bath and lots of power points around the room it s quiet apart from the occasional church chimes on rue bonaparte contemporary original artworks dotted around the room and staircase there is an option to take breakfast in the room or in the arched room but i didn t take up the option as i preferred to work up an appetite by walking before breakfast
