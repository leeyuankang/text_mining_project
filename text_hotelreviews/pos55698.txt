the location is superb close enough to walk to the seine or st germain but not so close you re on top of everyone the louvre is approx minutes walk across the bridge all other attractions in timed proximity to that the hotel is charming in the typical small euro elevator the wide winding staircases and the modern rooms dripping with comfort the staff were happy to recommend places to eat arrange airport shuttle for us persons luggages we were at the end of our trip with luggage that gained weight mysteriously otherwise the metro is close by and lots of buses that run to the airport
