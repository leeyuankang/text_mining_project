we previously visited this hotel years ago and since then the bedrooms have been refurbished and very nice bar reception area built we found improvements to be very tasteful modern but without losing its charm and breakfast in basement is still a wonderful experience with french continental breakfast hotel is in great location easy walking distance to louvre notre dame and many other sights museums we will certainly return again next time we are in paris
