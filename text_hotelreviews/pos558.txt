unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized the location is great which is only munites walk from earl s court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around the room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in london it only takes about munites going from heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in london not very early i will definitely prefer this hotel next time
