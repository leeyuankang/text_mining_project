the location of the hotel was very excellent as it takes less than min to reach the hyde park oxford street and the big bus station the reception was very friendly and flexible with me especially saleem who can speak arabic and explain to me the hotel history and how can i enjoy my first visit to london also i loved the classic style of the hotel
