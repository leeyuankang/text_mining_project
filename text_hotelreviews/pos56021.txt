the hotel was very close to the main shopping area in london staff were very helpful in all aspects even after checkout where they saved our luggage in the reception we had a late train back to sheffield so we kept our luggage in the hotel the suite was spacious and the room was made to accommodate the three of us by converting the sofa bed into a nice comfortable bed
