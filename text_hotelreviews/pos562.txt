this is an excellent hotel location is amazing just minutes from earl s court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the city we could easily walk to kensington high street hyde park natural history museum etc excellent shower phenomenal water pressure room was clean bed was very comfortable staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants breakfast was very good the hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out we will be back
