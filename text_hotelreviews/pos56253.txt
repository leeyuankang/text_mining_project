excellent place to stay with excellent transport links via the tube with bayswater station and queensway station within walking distance giving you three different subway lines you can easily get to any part of london easy and safe to come back to after a late musical at west end the road queensway is a nice area with a few really good chinese restaurants gold mine and four seasons walk in the opposite direction from doubletree and you can walk to portobello market in about mins what a wonderful bustling market beds were comfy cookie given was delicious loved it morning breakfast was ok sufficient but gets a bit boring after a few days as the same food is served all the time stayed for nights standard hot english breakfast also with cereals muffins breads and pastries overall highly recommended i ll certainly stay there again
