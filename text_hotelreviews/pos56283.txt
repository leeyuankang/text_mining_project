the hotel is modern clean and easily accessible staff were efficient and friendly i reported a plumbing problem which was fixed very promptly hyde park is very close as is portobello road market we walked into the west end through the park without difficulty south kensington is similarly accessible and has shops museums and of course the albert hall the bayswater road is a main route and is well served by bus tube and taxis euston is about minutes by taxi i liked the fact that each bedroom has a nespresso machine i was only sad to find a small number of coffee capsules possibly more would have been available for the asking it certainly led me to the nespresso boutique in regent street so the product placement was effective in my case
