the location of the hotel near kensington garden was great we could easily walk to different tube stations notting hill gate bayswater and queensgate this offered a lot of opportunity to get around london via the tube the staff was extremely friendly and helpful i was able to get ice from the restaurant which also offered great dining options the breakfast buffet was also amazing
