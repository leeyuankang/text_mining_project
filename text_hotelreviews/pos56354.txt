as a muslim traveller i was very concerned about the hotel breakfast but found that in its own way the hotel breakfast was very much compliant to my needs in its own unique way walking distance to queensway commercial area and to the tube queensway and bayswater this hotel is really fantastic in terms of location lots of food especially halal food nearby here take your pick the hotel itself is very much what you expect to find from a reputable international brand i originally wanted to stay at other hotels around there but im glad i didnt as this hotel gave me everything i needed and more no regrets whatsoever and i will go back and stay there for my next visit to london thats for sure staff all warm and friendly they even helped me with my late checkout as i had a late evening flight back to kuala lumpur for a small extra late check out charge i didnt mind actually bcoz i check out at pm actually for additional their f b staff all warm and friendly and after a day or two treat you like they know you forever
