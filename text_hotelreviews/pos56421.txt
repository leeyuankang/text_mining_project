although the rooms were alittle small they were comfortable the tv had so many international channels that we really enjoyed the bathroom is nice and clean overall clean modern and great hotel but what really stood out was the staff everyone we had to deal with was friendly and helpful ee really enjoyed the stay and yes a great blueberry pancake which we ordered everyday the best part is when they gave us the best chocolate cookie when we checked in
