the location of the hotel was excellent the immediate neighborhood is not busy or loud at night the building faces bayswater road and kensington palace gardens are across the street the property is seven stories tall and runs back quite a way from the street it is close enough to both notting hill and bayswater to have a selection of shops and restaurants nearby i would heartily recommend the champion a pub just down the street they have a good beer selection on tap and offer high quality food options the hotel is also conveniently located to two tube stops notting hill gate and queensway and is a five minute taxi ride from paddington station the terminus of express trains from heathrow the hotel itself is clean and well appointed the lobby is a bit small so not somewhere you d want to wait around for people but that s not a big deal the two lifts run quickly and i never had to wait more than a moment for one to arrive the nespresso machine in each queen or higher room was a nice touch my room was clean and well tended by the housekeeping staff front desk staff were friendly and happy to oblige my requests printing tickets sending up extra free bottled water handing out additional cookies
