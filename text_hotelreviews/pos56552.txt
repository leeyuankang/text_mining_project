this hotel is great for a short stay in london if you re after a great hotel in a fab location choose this we chose king size room which although not an overly large room was perfect for what we needed the room was very comfy and clean the heating air conditioning was very useful and free wifi was a bonus and strong the staff are very helpful and always have a smile on arrival they present you with their own warm cookies i declined mine due to nuts but gave my partner two anyway the location of the hotel was perfect for us as was situated a short walk in both directions to local tube stations and if you crossed the road you were immediately in hyde park which was great we even walked from the hotel to marble arch and oxford street although if you re not one for walking i would not suggest this min walk the bus stops were right outside the hotel which also made getting around really easy we would recommend the champion pub which serves lovely cooked food and atmosphere which is a couple of minutes walk towards notting hill gate station the hotel does have an on site gym and restaurant cafe however we did not use these so cannot comment overall fantastic stay and will possibly be returning in a couple of months
