as always a wonderful stay at the doubletree location is ideal for exploring hyde park and surrounding areas and the beds are still mind blowingly comfortable we opted for a balcony this stay and i would say the views aren t great as this is on the mezzanine floor floor essentially so may not book that again but i would still give this hotel that free cookie on check in never gets old either
