we visited to celebrate my mother s birthday i emailed the hotel beforehand about this and was delighted to find my mother had been upgraded to a suite with great views over waterloo and the shard there was also a card a bottle of red wine and some chocolates in her room to mark the occasion the reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and there were plenty of staff around in the dining room at breakfast to clear tables etc the location of the hotel is excellent we caught the river boat from westminster pier just across the river to greenwich which was a really relaxing way to travel also visited the view from the shard which is tube stops away there are plenty of restaurants nearby thank you very much to the hotel staff for a great stay
