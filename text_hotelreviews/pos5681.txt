location location location you can not beat this location if you are traveling with kids we were steps away from the london eye and enough children activities to consume a full day when tired we easily walked back to the hotel the next day we were within walking distance to the waterloo train station all of the hop on hop buses stopped near by and the city buses ran through the night with stops very close to the hotel at the end of a long day it was great to lay in bed with big ben and the london eye as my view no need for an alarm clock just look up and big ben was close enough to tell you the time can t wait to stay here again
