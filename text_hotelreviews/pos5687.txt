the staff were very friendly and room service was very good even though we couldn t eat everything overall a very nice hotel with excellent views and the price is justified and having been ill for a long time this was a welcome relief and fantastic time was had by all we stopped in a exc suite with a city view we woke up to views of the shard very well worth the money i m glad i paid a bit more but as three of us were travelling splitting this down meant we each paid for one night
