the room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room we had a fantastic view of the the london eye but not much of the city from the floor the staff were very friendly and helpful a great hotel that treated children warmly as guests it was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could the mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror
