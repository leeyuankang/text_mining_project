everything about the ritz was marvellous i have been travelling on holiday with my dad and this stay at the ritz for the last night of our trip was a much looked forward to treat the staff are wonderful the room was enormous and so comfortable the bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower with plenty of towels and bathrobes the dinner in the restaurant was one of the nicest i have ever had while the ritz is very expensive it is so worth it this was the perfect way to end a dream holiday
