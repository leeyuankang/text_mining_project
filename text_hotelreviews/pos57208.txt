we stayed for nights and loved everything about this hotel the history atmosphere rooms furnishing everything made us feel like we were years away from the present time the room the room was very spacious especially considering how central the hotel is it is definitely a luxury to stay in a room that big in central london the bathroom was nice and marbled they even put a lovely fresh stem of flower by the sink for you they also had a heated rack for the towels so it was really nice and warm after a long nice shower i loved the pressure of the shower as well it was quite strong considering the vintage style hot water water temperature was consistent throughout the shower and the shampoo and conditioner they provide was really great i thought it made my hair look and feel better the location i cannot think of a better location than where the ritz was it was very close to the main shopping street so you can be shopping till you dropped on regent street but far enough so that the flow of people around the hotel wasn t all too overwhelming there are several restaurants near the hotel and the lovely green park is literally beside it talk about convenience and easy access to the underground they even have the ritz marked on the underground exit staff the staff were friendly and very professional reception was very efficient checked in without problems and check out was even smoother the doormen were all lovely the attire smiles hat and that special charm when they greet you oh they were most consistent in greeting us and we always felt like being transported to another time service they were very helpful and responsive when inquiries are made we have requested to leave our luggage for a week with the hotel upon checkout since we were headed to scotland and they gladly assisted us we were really impressed and appreciated their service considering we left quite a few things
