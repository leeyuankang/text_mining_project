we arrived at and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in london great although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however not sure they should have charged us extra given the view i think if you are going to charge an extra pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view but we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from us
