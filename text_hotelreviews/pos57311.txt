great location for parks shopping and galleries excellent room a good size and very quiet breakfast was wonderful the choice was just right it was not an overwhelming buffet but just enough and the quality of the food was very good while the dining room is just a joy to sit in the bar was pleasant and the staff attentive and polite we even got to taste two or three wines before making our choice a highlight of our visit was the bag of frozen peas which we needed in order to cook a pea velout for a christmas lunch this was greeted with a well i ve never had a request like that before but a sous chef arrived within two minutes and handed over a bag of peas with a smile we are eternally grateful the pea velout was ritz standard and the christmas decorations were so fantastic that we just had to take some photos
