i had read other peoples reviews some great some not i have got to say although this cost me an absolute fortune it was worth every penny to see my mums face light up i had booked this as a early xmas present for my mum me and a friend the staff where amazing i have never known such attention to detail friendly attentive and brilliant food was great and they where able to accommodate my allergies easily with plenty of choice the staff where very easy going and ready for a chat and a laugh not stuffy or miserable as lead to believe by some of the reviews the room was lovely and clean and the beds where so comfy i slept the best i had slept in ages the only downside is the drinks are very expensive but the memories we are left with are priceless i would recommend this to anyone wanting to create a lasting memory for a family member or friend go treat yourself
