amazing modern rooms and very friendly staff great breakfast with lots of choice hotel was really close to the tube station so very easy to get around london having a coffee machine in the room was really nice and the dressing gowns are so fluffy we were also given a voucher to spend in the bar which was a really nice touch and i would defiantly stay again
