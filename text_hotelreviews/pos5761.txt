hotel management promptly reached out to me after reaching out to them to voice my concerns with my park plaza experience they were apologetic and quickly spoke to the departments that i had experienced sub par hotel service to try and address any issues hotel management also was very generous in their offer for compensation to compensate for my poor experience even though i declined any compensation i was very pleased with their desire to correct my issues to be consistent with standard park plaza experiences after speaking with hotel management i feel more comfortable with the possibility of returning to park plaza
