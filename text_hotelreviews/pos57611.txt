stayed here previously as the location is close to where my son lives and therefore very convenient hotel is very modern and staff very friendly check in seemed to be a little slow but we were offered a glass of prosecco as we waited we booked a club double and the room was spacious clean with the usual mod cons wouldn t hesitate to stay again
