totally disappointed had been recommended this hotel booked the restaurant for the evening meal daughters birthday actually only to be told on arrival it was closed an noone could locate our booking had to find a taxi and go elsewhere not towels available in the swimming area and upon our arrival of a pre booked booking reception insisted they need to see out card we booked with which was at home had to ask our son to send a picture of it do fail to see the relevance of this
