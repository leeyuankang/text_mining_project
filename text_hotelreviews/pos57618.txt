we liked just about everything at this fantastic modern hotel our room was generously sized and very clean with lovely comfy beds tasteful decor and all mod cons bathroom was also much more generously proportioned than most other london hotels i have stayed at staff were very helpful and friendly we took a dip in the swimming pool which was small but very nice and clean shoreditch isn t tbe most scenic location but i would definitely stay at this hotel again
