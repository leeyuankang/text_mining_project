i think its difficult to find such balanced hotels in terms of work leisure i stayed nights at this property and everything was exceptionally good during my entire stay not a single instance i felt any lack of service standards or any hassles like calling reception for iron board or something not working which is very common while staying at hotels the staff was very co operative and the rooms were modern and equipped with all the facilities
