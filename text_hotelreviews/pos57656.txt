we stayed here for my wife s birthday weekend i told the hotel in advance of the celebration and charlene did a great job with decorating the bed with balloons and flowers and giving us some absolutely delicious pie and fruits it was a lovely added touch and surprise for my wife the room was on the floor with a nice view it s all pretty high tech with touchpads to control the lighting and electric curtains although sometimes it can be a tad temperamental the room and bathroom was clean spacious and comfortable the hotel is in a good location just a short walk from old street station
