immaculate hotel great location staff approachable helpful friendly in room gadgets which impressed the fella a beautiful spa which we both relaxed in for most of the morning we didn t eat at the hotel so not able to comment on food beds amazingly comfortable would recommend this hotel whether it be as a base to explore london or a chilled out overnight weekend break
