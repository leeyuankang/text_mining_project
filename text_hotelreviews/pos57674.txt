wasn t able to rate the hotel restaurant as well as restaurants near by as we had a reservation in mayfair however our stay was amazing a massive thank you to charlene whom i spoke with prior to coming she arranged an amazing set up in the room for my partners birthday which is thoroughly adored another thank you to victoria who welcomed us then took us to our suite great service only thing was the jacuzzi wasn t working which i really wanted to use however i swam instead the pool area was exceptionally clean although there was a lot of people at the hotel the spa area wasn t to busy or noisy which was perfect for me to relax definitely going back sometime i
