this hotel s customer service exceeded my expectations the housekeepers were always friendly and helpful and said hi when i passed them in the hallway from time to time they even asked me if i needed anything when my coffee maker was having issues the housekeeper promptly called for a maintenance specialist who was just so courteous and helpful and when i left an item in the room and came back a couple of days later to retrieve it they had kept it neatly tucked away for me really outstanding keep up the great work
