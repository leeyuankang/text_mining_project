the hotel is located extremely close the old street station tube in the northern line of the london underground its location is amazing if you want to live and breath the east london vibe since it is at the heart of shoreditch with restaurants food and coffee chains and local pubs and cafes all within a very very close distance the hotel offers an indoor pool although not so big sized and a jacuzzi and full equiped gym which is very convinient since it opperates from very early in the morning the room is all modern inside and all features from the curtain drapes to the bed table lights operates through touch screens right next to the hotel there is a pret a manger chain and a sainsbury s local which is also very convinient for a quick breakfast or some grocery shopping within a minute walking distance there is a bus stop that takes you straight to oxford street no upon arrival they upgraded us to a better room as the receptionist informed us from the room we have booked and our new room is located on the floor offering us an almost panoramic view of london all the way to st paul s cathedral highly recommended
