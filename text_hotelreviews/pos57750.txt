amazing fantastic hotel by far the best hotel i have ever stayed at it is so hi tech everything about the hotel is new and fresh the entire room is controlled by touch screen the bathroom has underfloor heating the television is big and you can even change the colour of the lights in the room with the touch of a button very very impressive the spa and pool area is designed by versace and like the rest of the hotel just oozes class and elegance we were celebrating our wedding and my recent qualification we were given a free upgrade with a nice surprise of flowers and desserts waiting in our room
