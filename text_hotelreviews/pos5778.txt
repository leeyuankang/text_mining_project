room extremely small so upgraded then upgraded again because we were so disappointed so the money we did end up spending could have been spent on a much nicer hotel room was freezing cold and took a very long time to heat up room felt commercial and not what expected bed was small always looked forward to the big bed in lovely hotels but not this one sorry but i wouldn t recommend on the plus side the view was good
