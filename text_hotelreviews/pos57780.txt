the bed was amazing room was a very good size could not fault the staff at all they gave me a complimentary breakfast because i was having a bad day which was a lovely little perk room service room was erm well the menu left a lot to be desired i understand certain staple items on menus so that all the guest have something to choose from but the menu was just so boring nothing on the menu that was beyond the norm or sparked up a appetite in any shape or form and as a lone guest i wasn t keen on dining in the restaurant by myself and i like to dine in the room but the room service menu could do with a fresher take but the gentleman that served me was lovely most of the tv channels didn t work in the room and i couldn t get a phone signal but the hotel provides a mobile you can use during the stay which is a very unique touch from the montcalm hotel chain and amazing value for money all in all
