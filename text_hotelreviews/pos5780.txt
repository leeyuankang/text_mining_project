nice hotel very clean and staff friendly plenty of choice for breakfast attractions are within walking distance and if you did need to get a taxi the park plaza opposite has a taxi rank with plenty of taxis waiting our hotel room had a kitchenette with microwave which was great as we have a toddler so was easy to warm her food and milk for the evening overall our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend
