fabulous hotel nothing was too much trouble the staff were so helpful the room was modern everything was controlled remotely even the curtains it was clean and very spacious for london fresh coffee available in the rooms quality bath robes and toiletries everything you needed and more having arrived too early to check in we left our bags with the concierge before going off for the day to see a show old street tube station is literally a one minute walk from the front door on return we were greeted by name and advised everything was ready for us and that our luggage was in the room waiting we enjoyed great cocktails during happy hour before going out for the evening there are great local restaurants all within walking distance from the hotel we ate at hoxton breakfast the following morning was good quality with plenty of choice we looked out from the floor over the sights of london and st pauls cathedral it was a relaxed affair there was no rush for us to eat and get out i would say this hotel is great value for money and would highly recommend if you want somewhere special to stay in london i really look forward to staying again
