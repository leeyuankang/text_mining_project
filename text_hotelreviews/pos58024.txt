gorgeous hotel modern great facilities convenient for bus and tube walk to shoreditch centre there was a bit of confusion about the booking and we were kept waiting for ages to book in while he sorted it out given that we d just flown in from australia and carried our bags from the tube it was the last thing we needed shame because everything else was perfect
