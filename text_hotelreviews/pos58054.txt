my partner and i had another lovely stay in m by montcalm while we celebrated his birthday i let the hotel know in advance that it was a special occasion and when we arrived we found our room had been upgraded and lots of special touches added adorable as normal our room was not only clean and comfy but huge too we re a big fan of the way everything can be controlled by the tablets and love how everything you could need is available in the room already we also made sure to take advantage of the pool and spa which is a really brilliant addition on top of that the hotel is in such a handy location meaning we were never far away from where we wanted to be we couldn t have been happier with our stay and will be back sooner than later
