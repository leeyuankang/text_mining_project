we have stayed at quite a few hotels in london which were all very nice however m by montcalm was by far the best i like to treat my partner to a london break every now and then but some hotels just feel wrong no matter how glorious they are for us it s all about how you feel m by montcalm made us feel great like meeting an old friend again we will definitely go back the staff were superb all round and upgraded our room simply because the room was available the room was great with fantastic views across london however i am really intreaged to see the views from the point at the front of the hotel next time we visit we would like to stay two nights and eat in the hotels floor restaurant as well as we did in hoxton again the location is perfect for a young couple as its in the heart of trendy shorditch with lively bars restaurants coffee shops and night clubs at your feet with luxury when you return back to the hotel literally can not fault this hotel m by montcalm is perfect
