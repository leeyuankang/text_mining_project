the food in the restaurant was very nice the sea bass was crispy and moist and full of flavour the burger which i did originally order with turkey bacon was great the bed was so comfortable and the shower was very clean tech city did not fail to please us as a young couple with controlled curtains lighting and other features within the room that made the stay enjoyable would definitely recommend this to a friend and i have done so
