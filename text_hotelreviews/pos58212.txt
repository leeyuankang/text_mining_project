beautiful clean modern hotel with polite staff beautiful place to to stay we booked a double room and a triple room double room was upgraded to a king suite which was beautiful both rooms had hermes bathing products and robes upon check in i had a call to the suite to ask if all was ok and was brought up cupcakes and a bottle of alcohol maybe because i mentioned it was my birthday also we were given a pound voucher per person per room to use in the casual lounge upstairs as there were of us we spent nothing that night as we had fish and chips or burgers in the lounge fish and chips recommended when i looked at this hotel online i was not too sure about the location or facilities but you have to see it to believe it it is lovely views are of the local city and mostly traffic but rooms and facilities were really good so views did not matter to me and i pay a premium for good views usually i went for the spa and it was lovely a small pool and jacuzzi but ample space for the people who visited behind the pool is a dry steam room and wet steam room with showers i think there s also a gym which i didn t get the time to use there is a relaxation room in the spa area with a few lounge chairs i feel it was very cosey and fresh cold water was available i would however say that me sister and i accidentally went into the mens changing room as there is a faint image of a man and a woman our bad i suppose montcalm is really good overall and i loved it and i will return i originally found out about this hotel on a friends social media and instantly enquired about it website doesn t do the hotel justice it s amazing as explained with the vouchers and upgraded breakfast we spent very little for our stay
