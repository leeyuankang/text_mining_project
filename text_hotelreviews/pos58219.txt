the location was perfect so close to old street underground station which was only a few stops from euston and really close to shoreditch for the bars and restaurants the staff were all super friendly helpful loved all of the mod cons in the room the bed was so comfy i just wished i d known about the spa so i could have brought my swimming costume hopefully i ll stay here next time i visit london so i can check it out
