i m so happy to have booked this hotel had a fantastic stay the staff were really pleasant and helpful while checking me in the room was lovely extremely clean and well presented everything is controlled on ipads which was really fun you could customize quite a bit with the lighting curtains and room temperature underfloor heating etc the bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept really well the bathroom was spotless and the shower was great the elemis products were a nice extra the location was great too the underground is right outside and it s also cheap enough to get a cab after hours overall you could really see the quality in the room from the full size hairdryer to the high quality selection of teas will definitely stay again
