stay in months and i absolutely love this hotel the decor the friendly and professional manner of staff everyone is so helpful i am so relaxed during and following my stay the spa facilities are peaceful and very calming the chill out room is a special touch comparable to any spa i ve ever been to the technology in the rooms are a treat the turn down service and the special touch of leaving fruit in the room i just feel special when i stay at m by montcalm shoreditch
