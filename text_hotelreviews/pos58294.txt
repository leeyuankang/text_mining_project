we loved everything about this hotel and our experience whilst we were there points that stood out to us were the attentive professional but friendly staff the technology in the rooms which worked perfectly every time personal touches such as beds being turned down and slippers being left by the side of the bed and the best breakfast i have ever tasted can highly recommend
