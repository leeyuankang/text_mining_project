throughout our stay the staff were really friendly and made sure we were happy with every little detail i had contacted them beforehand to ask for a few little touches to be added to the room to make it all the more special and they fulfilled this in the loveliest of ways rose petals on the bed cupcakes and a card we loved the way the room functioned through tablets and couldn t get enough of the lighting in the bedroom and the underfloor heating in the bathroom it came with everything we could need and more not only was it stunning on the eye but also especially comfortable and clean too we had a hard time leaving this spot of luxury behind so will be sure to stay here again
