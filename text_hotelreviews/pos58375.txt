we loved everything from the staff on the front desk the concierge the room was exceptional the modern touches were great i m my girlfriend is we are from dc and we both thought the hotel great our initial reaction was that the online info did not do the hotel justice all for a great price too there s no doubt we would stay there on our next trip
