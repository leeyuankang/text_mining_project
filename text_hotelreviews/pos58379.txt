the hotel was very inviting and immaculately clean the staff were very professional friendly and helpful i stayed in a deluxe double room and it was amazing great size and the bed was very comfortable also the decor was sleek and didn t feel like i was staying in a basic hotel the spa facilities and pool were very relaxing i will definitely be staying here again in the future
