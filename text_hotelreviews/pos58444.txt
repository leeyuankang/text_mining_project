the facilities were excellent especially the spa we stayed in the deluxe double and it made you wonder why you would pay any more to stay anywhere else the touch screen remotes were fantastic and the modern decor was very tasteful the bed was comfy and the bathroom facilities were also excellent as well as clean the staff were very attentive and friendly
