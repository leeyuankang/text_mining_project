the location was fantastic and we upgraded so had an amazing view of big be and the london eye the seperated space for the sofa bed was great so that my husband and i didn t have to go to sleep when our year needed too the housekeeping staff left a little note and a fun size mars bar for each of my little boys toys cause they looked hungry i love little personal touches like that
