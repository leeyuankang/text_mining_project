this is in a great location for exploring the sites right by the london eye and cheaper than the park plaza opposite don t be put off by the outside the rooms are modern and staff are really friendly and helpful there s a handy italian restaurant on site if you want a night in with good food at a reasonable price you might even get an upgrade we were given a suite on arrival which had a small lounge area kitchenette and big comfy bed the room was really quiet and super clean would definitely recommend
