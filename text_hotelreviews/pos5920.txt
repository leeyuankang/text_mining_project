attentive service and a well managed check in we ended up being upgraded which was amazing city skyline and london eye views were stunning very well appointed room helpful concierges meant never waiting for a cab breakfast was little pricy but a very pragmatic approach to feeding the kids easy walk from waterloo which connected directly with euston station so straight to the heart of the landmark district
