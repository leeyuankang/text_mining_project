on arrival we were upgraded from a superior room to a studio apartment which was excellent the bathroom was very nice with a lovely bath and fantastic shower the staff were very pleasant and the doorman was happy to stand out in the rain until he could hail us down a taxi the cocktails in the bar were very good particularly the pina colada we didn t manage to sample the breakfast but overall i was very happy with my choice of hotel
