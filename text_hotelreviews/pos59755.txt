super comfy bed super clean small but very well appointed space unique and creative loved it everything in the room was uniquely designed but with a useful purpose the staff is friendly and welcoming the lobby is small and cozy a great place to sit and have a cup of coffee or wine there is also a small outside patio we loved the place and the location
