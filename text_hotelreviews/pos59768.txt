a little gem of find in paris the staff were very friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble the best bed i ve ever slept in and it s spotlessly clean i stayed in the deluxe room and it was quite spacious for paris the next time i m lucky enough to be in paris this is where we ll be staying right on the number metro line great base for touring paris
