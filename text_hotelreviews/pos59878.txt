loved the style of the hotel part of it is old with a new bit added on but how it s been done makes it look continental in the reception area good location for what we were doing elo gig at wembley about a minute walk from the tube willesden green to the hotel tube from there to wembley is about minutes room was spacious and comfortable it wasn t obvious where to go for breakfast upstairs the sign for this was pointing away from where we came into reception from our ground floor room no big deal though breakfast was a help yourself cereal pastries toast hot drinks were brought to you and cooked breakfast done to order however the waitress that seated us did not explain any of this i had poached eggs and my husband had fried eggs on our breakfast both were hard we didnt complain though the overall portion of the breakfast was generous and this was an irish breakfast as opposed to english as part of it included black pudding overall we felt this hotel was a little gem and somewhere we will definitely use again when we travel to london
