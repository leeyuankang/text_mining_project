the staff were incredible once my boyfriend mentioned that it was my birthday they went above and beyond to make it a very special day our room was upgraded and we received a complimentary breakfast and dinner the bed was comfy and the room was airy thanks to air conditioning the only slightly off putting thing about the room was that it had two massive mirrors facing the bed i understand this was done to make the room look bigger but it was slightly disconcerting to wake up and look straight in the mirror the hotel is a bit difficult to navigate but the staff are very helpful and made sure we found our way to the pool which is lovely the location is very near public transport and busses go regularly back to the tube station
