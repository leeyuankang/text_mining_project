we have stayed at this hotel a number of times before and it s always comfortable and pleasant and the rooms are amazingly quiet for such a buzzy place in a busy area the staff are helpful and almost always really charming and friendly the breakfasts are good and excellent value it s not in a posh area which might bother some people but very cosmopolitan there is a fabulous indian restaurant just a few minutes walk down the road on the same side as the hotel i think it s called khan or similar very well worth visiting and insanely cheap
