we stayed here for three nights whilst down in london for the marathon a little bit of a walk from the station either kilburn or willisden green but definitely worth it the hotel is ideally situated very nice decor and very clean and very helpful staff would recommend and use again very handy for wembley park too the pool looked lovely but never got the chance to use it despite being situated on a main road the rooms were very quiet
