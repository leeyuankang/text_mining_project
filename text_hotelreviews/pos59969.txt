my wife and i loved our stay here its clean the room is spacious comfortable mattress and we enjoyed a quick morning swim in the pool before starting off to sightsee in london everything thats listed and shown in photos is exactly what we found helpful staff clean areas and it has easy access to both buses and trains bus stop in front of the main door and a stroll to the underground station we also enjoyed tea and a wide selction of cakes from the cafe opposite the cakes are baked on the premises and its open so it was enjoyable to sit there at after a day s hard work seeing the sights to relax over a hot choclate or latte and a wicked slice of cake before bedtime we also used the restaurant s pub for dinner and have nothing but praise for bar staf atmosphere and the food delicious we had a very pleasant break here one drawback is that beds are a little too comfy we found it hard to leave
