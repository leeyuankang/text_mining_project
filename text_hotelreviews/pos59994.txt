i love the juxtaposition of a lovely hotel on a typical london high road i was impressed from the moment i stepped into the reception area which was clean and tidy and attractively presented this hotel is perfectly located for getting around london a stones throw away from the hotel there are bus stops which transport you to brent cross victoria kilburn including a hour service to oxford circus invest in an oyster card if you don t have one already the hotel breakfast is very good you get a comprehensive choice of continental and not or a hot traditional english breakfast which sets you up for the day ahead we shall definitely stay here again
