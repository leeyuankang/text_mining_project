the hotel is quite fine due it s exterior and interior location is ok i guess you get what you pay for since we used to be staying at star hotels in the future this one came a slight dissapointed however i have noticed it is only star so all understandable the rooms are nice clean and good size nice amenity having indoor swimming pool too
