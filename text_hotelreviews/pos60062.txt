the hotel once inside was absolutely fantastic for the price you pay i m used to premier inn s which whilst very good for the price in london cost about the same as the clayton and the clayton adds in that extra star rating giving you a slightly more luxurious stay the rooms were very spacious by any standards and incredibly spacious for london standards the bathroom was clean and modern and the room was very nice my girlfriend used the bath and seemed to enjoy it i had a few showers during the stay and found the shower was very powerful some may like this i found it fine do note though if you turn down the power you are almost pressed against the wall trying to stand under the water the bed too was comfortable and warm the room also had air conditioning although we didn t feel the need to use it during our stay the location was very good for our needs as we needed easy access to london in order to get to a workshop in the center it was easiest to walk miles to cricklewood station to get to st pancras and from there get the underground to our final destination it would ve been cheaper and easier had the hotel been slightly closer to an underground station but wasn t much of an issue for us
