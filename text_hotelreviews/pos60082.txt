very spacious room and bathroom with large thick towels we were arriving from st pancras and visiting family nearby so the location was ideal but even for those wanting to tourist about the cricklewood train station is just up the street and while not as frequently serviced as the tube a quick check on google maps or citymapper will confirm the train schedules there are several tasty inexpensive restaurants and cafes in the area as well as a couple of costa coffee shops although we also enjoyed drinks and an evening snack at the hotel s bar the wifi worked well even in the lower level rooms facing the pool finally the staff was very helpful managing to sort out an early check in for us which was quite appreciated finally the noise insulation was quite good we didn t hear a thing from the weddings and birthday parties that took place over the weekend
