the staff were very pleasant and helpful parking convenient and good value for london the large family room had a single and double bed and was very clean slept like a log as the beds were so comfortable minute walk to kilburn tube station which was easy to find walking through this multicultural area took us about minutes to get to oxford street ideal as only staying overnight didn t use the hotel facilities but would definitely use this hotel again
