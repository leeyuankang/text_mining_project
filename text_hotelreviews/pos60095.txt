staff were extremely helpful let us check in early which was great as we were tired after an early morning flight they gave us advice on the best ways to travel etc rooms were really spacious and bed was very comfortable the hotel was quiet and relaxing and the pool was open until pm which was great as we didn t have time earlier in the evening
