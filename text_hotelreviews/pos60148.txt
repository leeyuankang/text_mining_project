i chose this hotel mainly because it is on a bus route convenient for my purposes it also has good transport links into central london and other areas several useful buses stop right outside there is a frequent and quite fast service into st pancras from the station nearby and kilburn tube and brondesbury overground are a short bus ride away all of these services are covered by the oyster card the room and the general decor are very pleasant clean and comfortable wifi is free and works fine the bathroom is well equipped and everything works well although it takes a while to work out how to operate the taps the pan asia restaurant on the premises has excellent food which is good value the menu is quite limited but the quality is high the service though friendly and polite isn t always very efficient
