first impressions always matter and the hotel made a good one as i walked into the ornate airy lobby and was greeted by gracious and professional staff check in was smooth and quick as for my room its size was much larger than i expected for a london hotel i was pleasantly surprised however i would say that the best feature about my room was the bed after a busy day in the city it was a relaxing treat to sink into the lush and fluffy duvet covers and drift off to dreamland it was as if clouds wrapped themselves around me and lulled me to sleep
