the room was a great size and the bedroom was clean the bar is great the quieter side inside the hotel rather than the section leading onto the front reception staff were friendly and helpful the food and service in the pan asian restaurant are fantastic breakfast was tasty and reasonable as hotel breakfasts go easy access to wembley stadium in spite of some criticisms this is a hotel where i feel comfy not like some soulless places i have stayed
