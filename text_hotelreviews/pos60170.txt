very nice staff and very clean hotel a really pleasant atmosphere the days were there i like the variety of food around the hotel the bagel bakery cake place across the road was nice we didn t have breakfast as we were busy out and about london but plan to include that on our next vista as it looked awesome indoor swimming pool was great for my little daughter she loved it and its a nice wake up call in the morning the water was warm as well
