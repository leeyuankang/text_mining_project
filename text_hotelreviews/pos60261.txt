this has not been the first time i stayed at this hotel i was only too glad to establish that despite the change in the name and eventually the administration the nice welcoming feel was there excellent state of cleanliness thanks to the very committed floor staff maids and all they have to be expressly praised for their effort immaculate linen what to say of the proximity to transport a bus stop right in the front of the hotel with buses getting you straight to victoria and other central london destinations tube station reasonably close supermarket and conveniece stores next door or accross the street burger king mcdonnalds kfcs costa caf within sight i could go on for ever
