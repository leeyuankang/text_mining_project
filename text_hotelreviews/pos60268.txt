the price of the hotel for the new year s was more than reasonable very close to the tube walking distance minutes or you can catch the bus right in front of the hotel the staff was awesome breakfast was worth pounds swimming pool and gym free wi fi in the room restaurant and bar with welcoming staff as well i will definitely visit this hotel again
