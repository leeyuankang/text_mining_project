great location very close to central london tube station a few blocks away interesting neighborhood convenient and reasonable price a night stay was around usd compared to other hotels for almost usd a night there is also a pool and fitness center that we did not go to but they do have it there s a mcdonald s right across the street which is good because uk food is mostly terrible any problems were mainly quickly addressed
