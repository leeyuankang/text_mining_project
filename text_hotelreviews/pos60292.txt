we were very happy with kind hotel stuff very good connection to public transportation hotel is nice clean and stylish even you need to pay extra for breakfast it is worth money it costs wide breakfast offer should satisfy everyone even i wrote some negatives in general we can recommend this hotel and we will probably consider this hotel again for our next stay in london
