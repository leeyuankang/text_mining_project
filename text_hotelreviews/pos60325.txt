it s always tricky finding somewhere to stay in london which has easy transport links but also ticks all the other boxes the hotel was just a taxi ride away from willesden green tube station there were plenty of shops around and really good bus links to nearby brent cross shopping centre we really enjoyed how easy it was to get around the hotel itself was lovely and we opted for the breakfast which was yummy our room was also really quiet from outside noise which was a plus
