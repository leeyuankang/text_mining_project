management and staff were extremely kind and polite any time spent in paris makes you brush up on your manners our room was spacious and quiet even though overlooking the main street across from cafe flores great as a base to explore the great st germain neighbourhood a charming french hotel the cafes nearby are great for breakfast and historic brasserie lipp is right next door having dinner there was an experience the room just gets buzzier as the night progresses waiters who are so professional they love their work and the restaurant st germain is a wonderful area
