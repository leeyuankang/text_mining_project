this hotel is absolutely lovely it is in a great location and was very clean and comfortable the room was very well designed tasteful decor and plenty of room for our things it felt very spacious we had everything we needed the windows opened onto a lovely quiet courtyard the hotel itself is quite small and we liked the cosy boutique feel the staff were lovely really friendly we simply adored it we didn t get around to having breakfast in the hotel but probably should have as we felt a bit ripped off by the cafe directly across the road highly recommend this lovely hotel and would go back in a heartbeat thank you for a wonderful and memorable stay for all the right reasons
