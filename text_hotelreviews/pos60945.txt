this place is so so charming aziz along with the entire staff were so helpful kind and professional as an american on her first trip to paris with my mother and daughter this was magical the hotel is quaint beautifully decorated and in a prime location in the st germain de pres district we especially loved cafe louise just next to the hotel for drinks lunch dinner and sidewalk cafe people watching the room was smaller than american rooms that was a bit of a shock but being that we just needed a clean comfy bed nice towels nice bathroom with products hotel au manoir really served highly recommend
