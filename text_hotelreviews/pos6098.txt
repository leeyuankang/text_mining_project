i loved our room it was very spacious nice decor we had a beautiful view of the london eye which looked great at night the staff were polite and friendly they made us feel welcome with little touches such as a birthday card for me and complimentary wine they also gave us a free upgrade on our room which was great the breakfast was good on both days we had it a good variety of different foods
