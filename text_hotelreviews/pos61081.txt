i requested a quiet room as i was exhausted from travel and it was truly a quiet room it was a loft room on the third floor which is only accessible via a flight of stairs from the second floor with no other rooms next to me and no traffic in the hallway in front of the room restaurant was very nice as well and late night room service was available for light snacks and sandwiches perfect after my flight delays they also offer a nice high tea staff was always helpful and courteous no matter the hour the hotel is about a minute walk from the underground which took me to central london in about minutes neighborhood is quiet mostly residential with some shops nearby
