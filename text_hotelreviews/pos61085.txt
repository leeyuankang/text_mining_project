perfect stay i chose this hotel for its world war ll history and because it is so unusual and beautiful our my adult daughter and i room was lovely a super comfortable bed free water in the mini fridge and delicious biscuits cookies in the room vintage fireplace beautiful garden view breakfast was a ma zing it was delicious with wonderful selection as if the hotel were not perfect enough the staff is remarkable if we had a question about directions they would look them up and print them off if we got lost while out sightseeing we would just call and they would cheerfully get us back i had wanted to see the historical marker but could not find it the clerk not only located it for us while we out sightseeing but he emailed me to tell me exactly where it was and sent a photo lastly despite there being a bit of a walk to the nearest tube stations the city bus has a stop right in front of the hotel
