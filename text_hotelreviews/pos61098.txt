overall a pleasant stay the exterior of the building and the ground are beautiful and the interior feels a bit historic but is well kempt i stayed in this area specifically because it would be easy get into central london and to get a train to heathrow in the morning which it was but i would not pay so much next time to stay in hammersmith
