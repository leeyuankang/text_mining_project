the hotel was immaculate the staff very helpful and polite the room was amazing and the bed was very comfy the night porter was excellent too didn t get chance to use restaurant slept past breakfast but it looked very good and the menu had very fair prices all round fantastic hotel and would highly recommend and it s very close to the piccadilly line about a min walk barons court so the london attractions are only a few stops away
