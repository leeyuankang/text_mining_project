superb stylish perfectly appointed boutique style hotel nothing too much trouble super clean room friendly staff that actually smile and seem to enjoy their job lovely restaurant really tasty juicy fillet steak served in the evening fantastic buffet continental breakfast included thank you did not miss the full english option or variants of this nice quiet room room tucked away at the top of hotel not huge but just right for the two of us and all amenities included compact but perfectly appointed bathroom with shower toilet and wash hand basin with good sized soft towels and windows that actually open in addition to the air conditioning a novelty in this day and age and most welcome too the property is quite a way out of central london and we did rack up a few taxi fares to be fair but if you are not in a hurry then no worries we felt this was a small price for the peace and quiet of the hotel even considering it is on the main hammersmith road the road works around the junction of brompton road harrods and kensington high street were a pain so our hindsight advice would be get a taxi to this point then walk a bit and get in another taxi you will probably save quite a bit of money that way the road works had been there for some weeks and looked like a marathon job certainly not the hotels fault just advice that s all average taxi to st pancras from the property through the road works and mins in time this was in january we would stay there again
