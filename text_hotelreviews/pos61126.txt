we loved everything about this hotel when we arrived we were upgraded by a lovely lady that i had spoken to the night before we had a knock at the door just after arriving and was greeted by members of staff with slippers and robes when night fell the xmas lights came on right outside our bedroom window and made our stay feel magical the room was warm and cosy and everything about our stay was fantastic great breakfast too when i got home the thing i did was to look for booking next year at the same time thank you st paul s see you in x
