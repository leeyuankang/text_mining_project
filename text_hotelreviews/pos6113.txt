my boyfriend and i had a great stay i arranged the trip to celebrate his birthday when we arrived the staff on reception were very welcoming and we were told we had been upgraded for free the room was immaculately cleaned and all the facilities bathroom kitchenette television lighting were great we spent most of our time out of the room and exploring london but if we had wanted to spend more time relaxing in the room then it would have been extremely comfortable to do so the location was great a very short walk from the london eye and other attractions it took us about minutes to get there from the hotel and close to waterloo station which was ideal for our arrival to and departure from london i would highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again on return trips to london
