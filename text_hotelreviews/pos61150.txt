the rooms are well appointed not especially large but very comfortable the bathrooms are good sized with both shower and tub rooms at the back of the hotel overlook the garden so are very quiet very good continental breakfast staff was pleasant hammersmith is not too near tourist areas but bus and tube lines are very close for convenience to my office it is great
