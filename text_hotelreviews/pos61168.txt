i loved the squishy pillows the heated tiled floor in the en suite the way the dim lights came on as you entered the bathroom at night the crunchy biscuits the little tray of tea coffee the walk in shower wet room with a ginormous shower head like a sunflower i was very unwell whilst exhibiting at the london bridal show in olympia and the hotel was my comfort when i got back each night i truly madly deeply wanted to live in my room for ever
