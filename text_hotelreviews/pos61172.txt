the location for the hammersmith apollo is great and with both hammersmith and baron s court tube stations are within walking distance so it s easy to get into more central areas like soho the building itself is very nice with a park to the back which some of the rooms and the restaurant where breakfast is served look onto continental breakfast included with room is fine anything hot must be paid for
