location was ideal with hammersmith olympia and baron s court stations within a few minutes walk the building and interior were very impressive and to a high quality room was surprisingly well lit with a beautiful fully tiled bathroom with underfloor heating staff couldn t be more helpful and the overall quality was close to that of a hotel this is the best hotel i have stayed in for under a night anywhere in the uk
