a wonderful boutique hotel in a conserved historical building the staff were gracious polite and very helpful the room was large and beautifully appointed and there was a very large bathtub in addition to a walkin shower a mini fridge was always supplied with free water and the coffee corner always had cookies as well the hotel is outside of central london but extremely well connected by tube and bus services it s only minutes by tube to heathrow airport the breakfast was a very adequate continenntal one a bit pricey but well worth it if you don t absolutely have to be in central london
