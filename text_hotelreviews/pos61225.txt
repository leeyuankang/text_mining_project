i spent one night here on a long layover between turkey and my home in the states this was the perfect place as i could take the tube followed by a short cab ride it is walking distance from the underground but with luggage its a hassle the room was cozy and well appointed the bathroom sumptuous wifi free i had a good scotch whiskey in the bar what else and dinner in the dining room the food was fine although i don t think i would eat here if i wasn t staying here in the morning i had the generous continental breakfast staff was friendly and helpful they extended my stay by a bit until i needed to leave for the airport i would have cheerfully stayed longer as for value its not cheap but what habitable hotel in london is since the basil street closed some years ago i haven t found a reasonably priced hotel in london to which i would return until now
