a beautiful building i had a standard double room for one night which wasn t large but had plenty of amenities and furniture i pretty much was straight into bed anyway lovely room overlooking the park would not have known the hotel is on a busy main road it was so quiet very comfortable room bed and pillows nice linen too which was soft and pleasant good modern bathroom which was spacious with walk in shower very helpful and polite staff didn t use the restaurant so unable to comment on dinner breakfast would not hesitate to recommend the hotel
