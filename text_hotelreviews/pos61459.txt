hotel is a reasonable small star hotel standard rooms do have a japanese size but are clean and ok second pillow is available breakfast is fully ok incl bacon and eggs not far from metro station japanese restaurant next to the hotel was brilliant with great food and a nice price the bar le in opposit to the hotel offers a cheap beer for only where you have to pay to in the hot spots not to much to see around however we started our walks directly from the hotel
