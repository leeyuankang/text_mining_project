very close to montparnasse train station few steps away from many restaurants especially many with asian food rooms are quite spacious for paris standards and continental breakfast is of very good quality we liked the bathtub and the speaker on the bathroom that allowed you to listen the tv we were lucky to have a view to les invalides and a glimpse of the eiffel tower
