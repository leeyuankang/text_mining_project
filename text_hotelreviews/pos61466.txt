the hotel is clean and well equiped the rooms are small like probably in many hotels in paris but when we moved a bed to a wall it was much more space for people living there the personel was very nice and helpful tasty breakfast with a decent choice of products meals hotel in a close distance to montparnasse station and even closer to another metro station close to a few restaurants and shops
