the location was excellent as we had to take the tgv from gare montparnasse the next day there are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area the room was fairly newly and attractively renovated was comfortable and had good wifi the hot water jug and mugs were great an easy and pleasant walk to jardin du luxembourg and the montparnasse cemetery both well worth a visit
