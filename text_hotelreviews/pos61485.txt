the reception guys are the happiest people i ve seen in the hotel they re very helpful as well the hotel is mins walking distance to the montparnasse train station which is nice if you worry about traffic in paris one thing i love is their bathroom and bathtub its clean and its brown earth color of the walls give a comfort feel
