the location is very good mainly because you are near to different metro stations for different routes through the city so everything is very accessible second i would like to mention the kyobashi japanese restaurant next to the hotel here one can serve lunch at resonable prices about with alot of appetizers and salat included plus home made ice tea the food is very tasty and there is a quiet and calm atmosphere all this after being disappointed by the over priced euros for a breakfast of croissants a marmalade bread and coffees and mostly over priced french brasserie type of paris restaurants
