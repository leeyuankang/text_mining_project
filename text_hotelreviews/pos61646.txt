although i thought over priced breakfast was excellent as it was cooked to order guest relations camille tried to solve our every concern with patience and resolve porters were always at your service and friendly some renovations of the hotel were in progress so there was a disruption in getting to the rooms expect it will be done by the end of the summer nice atmosphere beautiful flowers in the reception area
