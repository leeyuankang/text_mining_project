it was located in a really nice area and the underground station was really close by the room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable they did have a nespresso machine in the room which was a huge plus for me as i m a coffee lover the staff were all really kind and helpful they even offer hot towels during check in and also offered us small bottled waters when we checked out
