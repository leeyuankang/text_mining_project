location location location right next to oxford st and tottenham court road underground station superior double room was spacious comfy and luxurious staff was friendly catered to our every need instantly room service was a delight and not that expensive highly recommended if you book a superior double room make sure you ask for the king size bed room size is then bigger when our flight got hours delayed booking com and the bloomsbury were kind enough to be flexible and not charge us for the change
