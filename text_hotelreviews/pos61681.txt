my sister and i took a trip together and hadn t been away for fun in so long the staff was amazing in every respect and we opted for the morning breakfast which was amazing the hotel was so very charming someone mentioned windows in the room but while we loved our room our goal was to see london so that didn t bother us at all the location is perfect very central but the block is quite so you don t feel overwhelmed right when you step out of the hotel i would stay there again in a heartbeat
