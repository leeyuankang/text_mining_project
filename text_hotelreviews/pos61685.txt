the hotel was just lovely felt luxurious loved the candles in the lanterns in the hallways the seating area in reception was cosy and i found the staff especially the doorman to be very nice helpful and made us feel special the bar in the evening had a great atmosphere and staff was again very nice brought us over water as well as our ordered drinks it was a very pleasant stay would definitely book the hotel again
