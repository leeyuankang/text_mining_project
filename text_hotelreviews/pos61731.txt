me and my daughter enjoyed our stay at the bloomsbury staff were very friendly and always greeted you with a smile when leaving we were both given bottle s of water for our journey home because of the heat we left our luggage at the hotel while we looked around london on our last day and picked it up early evening on collection the young concierge carried our bags out and asked if we had enjoyed our stay and to have a safe journey home very polite young man great location and room was fantastic we will return to this fantastic hotel
