i was traveling alone for business i loved the building and it s history every single staff member was helpful and the service was excellent everyone i encountered went way beyond what was expected to provide first class service and an enjoyable experience the two nights i dined alone in the restaurant the manager and waiters were friendly and conversive and i never felt like i was on my own the rooms are beautiful and comfortable and were always spotless after cleaning the outside bar was a great place to have a drink i could not be happier with my stay and i look forward to my next visit
