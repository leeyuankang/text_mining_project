the hotel is absolutely great when we arrived we were given a warm welcome from eloise the girl in the afternoon shift we were given a upgrade to the executive studio so we had a view on big ben and the parliament all the time the room was perfectly taken cared of when we were departuring we check out with tiffany who welcomed us again at the park plaza and again we shall stay here whenever we visit london
