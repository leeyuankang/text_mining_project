all staff were friendly and helpful in all parts of the hotel we had to change our plans to eat out and switch to the hotel restaurant this was sorted with ease the hotel restaurant wasn t the most atmospheric but the food was lovely as was the service room very well eqipped and comfortable scrambled eggs at breakfast were actually the texture of creamy scrambled eggs almost unheard of for hotel breakfasts great location for south and central london
