absolutely brilliant location mins from tottenham court rd station minutes from british museum and the shopping theatre strips although so close to the action it was quiet and peaceful staff were helpful and courteous bed was so comfortable that it was a tough choice to leave the room i appreciated the personal note from management and the treats left in my room on a number of occasions i did not use restaurant as there were many cosy cafes in the neighbourhood and yes i would definitely stay again
