breakfast was exceptionally good on arrival we got a room that was quite noisy due to some plumbing or whatever but staff member adriana gave us a new and better in fact upgraded for free room within minutes of our telling of the problem the hotel is superbly situated and staff is very helpful and attentive i shall certainly consider thje blooomsbury for my next stay in london
