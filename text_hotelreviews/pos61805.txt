the staff were all extremely helpful charming and very prompt to fix any problems i was very pleased to get a truly excellent upgrade plus a free meal in the restaurant in compensation for some issues i encountered e g feeling cold in the restaurant due to draughty air restaurant food is excellent and the hotel location is very practical so overall i would rate the hotel highly despite a few issues as the staff i was in contact with went to great lengths to see that i was more than adequately compensated for some of the issues i experienced
