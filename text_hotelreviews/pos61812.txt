we were in london to see the war of the worlds at the dominion theatre to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were given a happy anniversary card and strawberries dipped in chocolate it was a lovely personal touch the bloomsbury is just a few steps away from the theatre close to the underground and we were even within walking distance of oxford street
