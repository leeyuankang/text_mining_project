the attention to detail through out the whole hotel was incredible from the facility to staff to the food the staff were so accommodating and friendly they organised a private driver to take us to the champagne region along with booking fabulous dinner locations the hotel was within walking distance to everywhere on the city you need to go or there was a metro stop at the front door
