the nolinski paris is a new and small hotel near the louvre and the opera the location is convenient if u like to be close to those sightseeing spots all hotel rooms in paris are rather small compared to berlin munich london dubai etc so the nolinski is no exception you have to take it or leave it i d like to point out that the concierge service was exceptional the concierge pierre organized all tours for the louvre the opera tickets and made all restaurant reservations very good also the spa experience was extraordinary the deep tissue massage by massage therapist julian was one of the best i ever had i can highly recommend
