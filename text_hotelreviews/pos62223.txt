i absolutely love everything about the nolinski this was my second time here and being in town for a longer time gave me the chance to enjoy the swimmingpool in the evening after a long walk it was magnificent and our suite ernest was absolutely fabulous room service was perfect and delicious and breakfast in the brasserie rejane was lovely as well this is one of my favorite hotels in the world and definitely the most wonderfully designed the attention to detail and the level of service is amazing and the absolute bonus point of the nolinski the staff remembers your name and they are genuinely happy to see you again try and find any other hotel or establishment where this happens i don t think you can the staff here is truly charming and smart
