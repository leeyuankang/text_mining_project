great location near the london eye waterloo underground station is a minute walk from hotel the hotel was perfect for our group of three sharing a room the room was very spacious and clean the bathroom had both a shower and bathtub which was a bonus the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful i am an american so was very happy to find an ice machine
