best place to stay in paris minutes walking to eiffel tower have travelled around the world but have not seen such customer service ever each and every individual is amazing especially stephani and maurizio who treated us like a family they give mobile to guests with internet and calling facility which you can use outside the hotel and i found it really useful they have hours complimentary coffee soft drinks and water in the lobby conclusion dont look further and book this place only
