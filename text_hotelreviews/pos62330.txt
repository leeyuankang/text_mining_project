i would like to especially praise agatha for all of her hard work as i had some issues with the rooms when i arrived i decided the room i had booked was too small so i asked to upgrade to the executive room which was much better unfortunately something kept tripping the electricity the wifi also wasn t working in the room agatha made further arrangements for my being upgraded to another executive room which was much better agatha is a star because since i was new to paris i came with a list of questions and she patiently answered them all for me as well as helping me with the changing of rooms
