the hotel is in a wonderful location it s a beautiful place with lots of very very friendly and helpful staff the breakfast is tasty the beds comfortable and the bar good the only reason i didn t give it a better rating is because the tv channels kept cutting out the lights went out randomly but were very very quickly fixed and perhaps the worst the walls and floor are paper thin so when you have upstairs neighbours who come in late and staff who start early it s quite noisy
