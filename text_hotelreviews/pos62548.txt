staff are extremely professional courteous and accommodating the cleaning staff kept our shower stall and toilet immaculate emphasis the maids didn t provide us with clean drinking glasses every night but in fairness we could see how the oversight could have been made after the first night they forgot to provide us with a second bedsheet but we didn t care even considering those things the maids were extremely good and did a very good job all of the staff paid attention to detail the hotel is always clean and staff are extremely courteous and accommodating our room provided a free smart phone to call back home unlimited as well as local unlimited including data that phone was amazingly helpful when we had a problem with charging our phone the hotel staff solved the problem immediately the hotel gave us a live person wake up call which is so much more amazing than just a discourteous computer ring that touch was an amazing way to end our stay at this hotel extremely courteous and professional staff
