the room amenities are excellent despite the room being not quite sq ft they managed to pack in everything one could want espresso lots of teas kettle hair dryer ironing board and more and the staff were always helpful and friendly the location is particularly good if you like being close to paddington to take the heathrow express and to visit kensington gardens among many other superb places of interest
