the first room allocated to me when i check in at midnight was a real disaster too small and above the kitchen hood too small it just fitted the bed and there was not even one cm to place your bags i could not stay there i asked for a better room i have to pay extra to get a descent room found it too too expensive and to my surprice the breakfast was not included and i have to pay like pound extra for a breakfast of a star hotel i recommend they go and see the cumberland hotel breakfast at a comparable price also i checked in after midnight and i have to check out at am my flight was at midnight sorry no late check out i think twice if i will stay there again
