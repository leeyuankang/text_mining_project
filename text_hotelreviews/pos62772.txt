beautiful hotel minutes walk from the moulin rouge the staff couldn t be more helpful and spoke very good english the room was spacious and spotlessly clean the only thing missing was a kettle for a cup of tea although there was an espresso machine in the room and a more comprehensive machine in reception for coffee and hot chocolate the restaurant out of the hotel to the right and minute walk on the opposite side of the road is well worth a visit enjoy
