everything was perfect close to the europe metro station which made travelling around the city very easy the room was gorgeous a large comfy bed and the shower in the room was lovely especially with the large shower head it was very relaxing after a long day free tea and coffee in the lounge and the speakers on the walls were brilliant we will definitely be returning to this amazing hotel
