the staff were friendly and efficient we arrived early and our room was not yet available but they offered to bring our luggage to the room while we started our sightseeing almost immediately the location was perfect since the train and some convenience stores are nearby the room is quite small which anyway is typical in paris but they more than made up for the space we had a very comfy bed in a lovely decorated room all in all stars for me
