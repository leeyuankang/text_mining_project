the hotel was lovely it was quirky super clean and had all mod cons the shower was amazing very chilled out and relaxing the staff were amazing they were very friendly and helpful i don t think i ve ever been in as relaxed a hotel the room was gregory s and very quiet because it s a small boutique hotel it felt very personal and a friendly place to stay i ll definitely go back next time i m in paris
