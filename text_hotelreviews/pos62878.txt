this was the first we d stayed in paris to close to the main attractions and we loved being able to walk to many of the sites we wanted to see we had breakfast on the champs lys es each morning walked to the grand palace for the rodin exhibition walked to the tuileries and the louvre etc you see so many little extra slices of parisian life this way we asked for a quiet room and were rewarded by one the back of the building looking out onto greenery the room was compact though very comfortable
