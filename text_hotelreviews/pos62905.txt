i decided to take my wife to paris as a surprise trip and chose to stay at hotel california this was the best decision i made the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and comfy the hotel were aware of our anniversary and surprised us with a free room upgrade which made our experience that extra bit special then we went up to our room to find fresh rose petals scattered all over our room with a teddy holding a card on the bed which read happy anniversary never have we felt so welcomed by a hotel before let alone in another country the hotel california team has given us memories to cherish for the rest of our lives thank you
