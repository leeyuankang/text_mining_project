the reception team were always helpful and multi lingual whilst a small hotel the staff to visitor ratio was high so everything was always tidy clean and a pleasant experience we took the executive room as rooms in paris are always small and it was a good size new facilities and modern even a lift straight to our door the bathroom had a tv to watch in the bath as well as a massive shower area breakfast was excellent self service from freshly prepared produce through a modern nibbles style but there was plenty of choice and eat as much as you want cake and coffee provide free on an afternoon the location was near to the main shopping area minute walk and very quiet from any road noise i would recommend this hotel with stars
