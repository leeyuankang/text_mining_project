i enjoyed my two night stay in hotel de seze tremendously the spacious junior suite has an old parisian charm yet it got a modern bathroom with clarins toiletries which i liked a lot the breakfast room is small but cozy the lady who served the breakfast every morning is elegant and diligent in checking everything is filled and in place the gentleman who helped us check in out speaks good english and is very hospitable
