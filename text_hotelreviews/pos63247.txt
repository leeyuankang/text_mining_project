the position of the hotel is extremely convenient only a few minutes walk to south kensington tube station yet in a quiet setting the staff could not have been more helpful we loved the quirky d cor and high degree of comfort the small restaurant has a good wine list and delicious well presented meals are offered i m almost inclined to keep this my lovely hotel a best kept secret but they deserve the recognition we are quite discerning read particular guests and we could not find fault with anything here the mini bar is stocked with quality product heaps of interesting pieces of artwork adorn the common areas for guests to enjoy the overall vibe of the hotel is trendy but really inviting very highly recommended
