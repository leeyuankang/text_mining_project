the room smelled of paint and the staff don t really care the doors are horrendous we were constantly awakened by banging doors in the morning it s a nightmare we had to open our windows to air the room in window due to the bad smell despite repeated talk to the front desk there was no communication between the staff when we spoke to the manager she offered us two complimentary breakfast the manager is not equipped to deal with customer complaints it s a great disappointment for us to have such service standard under the the soho house group i will not recommend this hotel for the prices charged and the service standard
