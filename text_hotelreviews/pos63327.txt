the rooms were just amazing slightly small but it s london so you re hardly expecting a huge room for the great price we got ours for the little additions of letters addressed to myself and a phone call minutes after we d got into our rooms to ask if we d settled made it all lovely cocktail bar and restaurant are amazing but there are so many cheap and delicious restaurants nearby we couldn t bring ourselves to not have a wander outside the hotel
