nearly across the street from gare du nord but with soundproof windows and super comfortable beds the room was generous for paris with a very large and modern bathroom the whole place is modern and very well designed staff was extra gracious to us speaking english and the whole experience which was really only a stop over became a highlight of our whole european trip
