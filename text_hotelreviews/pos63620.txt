the location is excellent for access to the gare du nord for the metro and eurostar the staff were all very nice and i especially appreciate their being so understanding when my tour changed its schedule unexpectedly and i had to change the dates i was planning to stay here my room was quite comfortable bless you for having a kettle in the room after staying at two other french hotels that didn t have this amenity i was delighted to be able to make a cup of tea again
