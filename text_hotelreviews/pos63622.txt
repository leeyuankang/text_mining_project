on arrival we asked for an ice bucket so that we could chill a bottle of champagne the friendly young receptionist suggested that he put it in a fridge and serve in the courtyard garden when our friends arrived this he did and there was no corkage charge he also recommended an excellent restaurant nearby and secured us a discount we loved our bird s eye view of seven parisian streets from our tiny balcony
