it s a great hotel that looks new we had two connecting rooms and though the rooms are small paris they are nicely furnished and convenient the stuff went out of their way to help in every matter the breakfast was good and in the lobby you have free hot drinks all day long and also some games the hotel is located across the street from a line metro station and meters from gare du nord which on one hand is very convenient but not very nice area at night
