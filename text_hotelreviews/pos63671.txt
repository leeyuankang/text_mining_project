excellent location for gare du nord minutes walk quiet room double glazing made room very quiet especially overlooking the courtyard ac could be switched off so room was almost silent a bonus for light sleepers our room was right by the lift but we heard no noise from it during the night curtains kept out light at night good choice of food at breakfast friendly and helpful staff tea making facilities in the room very clean
