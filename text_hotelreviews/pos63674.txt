the front office staff is very very friendly and accomodating he makes the welcome atmosphere feel so homey and warm the hotel located just m from gare du nord exit not too far for traveller with big luggages the room is somehow bigger than average room size in paris but not too spacious the room is clean and the wifi works just fine
