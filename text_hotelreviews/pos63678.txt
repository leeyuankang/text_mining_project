the bed was really comfortable and the room was well appointed with everything one might need the staff were so helpful and pleasant directing us to an excellent restaurant with a discount and most solicitous of our needs as we were travelling the next day the location close to the gard du nord was convenient but even though the streets are lively all night the sound proofing was so effective i wasn t disturbed at all a thoroughly pleasant experience and this is on my short list for staying in paris in future
