the staff were excellent welcoming helpful and seemed to have a real pride in their establishment and their work the hotel was very clean and comfortable and secure it is perfectly situated for the gare du nord though the district around a major station is never going to be the most scenic no evening restaurant but there are plenty locally and some good ones the hotel hor has a good ambience a bit of style and is excellent value recommended
