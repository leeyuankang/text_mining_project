friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was brilliant there are leaflets telling guests how to get to all the main attractions by metro walk rer and importantly bus which is impossible to find out about beforehand at least this way you get to see the city enroute there is a permanent free coffee available breakfast comes in two packages of croissants juice and coffee and the other an american style the location almost opposite the gare du nord is so convenient meaning no awkward transport transfer with luggage the hotel is new and ultra clean and with two lifts we never had to wait to access the upper floor
