the bedroom was warm and comfortable the bathroom very clean and modern lots and lots of very hot water although the hotel is situated on a busy street the room was so well insulated and sound proofed that i was able to sleep very peacefully i was travelling alone but felt very safe the lifts are inaccessible without a room key and there were staff on duty in the lobby at all times
