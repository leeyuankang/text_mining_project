we absolutely loved our room we had a sixth floor room with a balcony everything was perfect very close to nord train station neighborhood yes was abit sketchy would not want to go out late at night but we were so tired out by early evening so we enjoyed our room paying abit extra for the room with the balcony we had no complaints about the size it was very roomy and clean the staff were excellent and spoke very good english to us we found them very friendly although we checked out at noon the staff kept our suitcase and allowed us to sit in the outdoor lounge and in the front lobby until it was time to go get the train the night clerk even gave me extra milk at night for our tea and coffee that was in the room after doing alot of research on paris hotels near nord i am so glad we picked the hotel hor no complaints about anything i would not hesitate to book again with them
