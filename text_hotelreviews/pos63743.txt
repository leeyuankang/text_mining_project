the staff were really kind and courteous and they were quick to help us when we had a question the young man on reception was also very friendly and spoke very good english the rooms are very clean and very modern ideal for couples the beds were really comfy and i fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow when we were there the staff informed us of a small water leak so they had to temporarily switch off the water however this was resolved the same day the hotel is situated just two minutes away from gare du nord which makes it ideal for access to the metro and the rer the surrounding areas are quite busy but you can t hear any traffic from your room
