the staff was very welcoming and helpful the hotel is newish and very clean we loved the bathroom our room overlooked the busy street but noise wasn t a problem hotel very well located for restaurants and the gare du nord there is a supermarket almost nextdoor to the hotel but it is really scungy and we walked in and out it seems to attract a very undesirable clientele unfortunately there were a lot of undesirables hanging around the train station but that did not impact on the hotel if we have to catch a train to or from gare du nord again we would stay at the hor
