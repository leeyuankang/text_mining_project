the location was close to all public transportation it s far away enough from paris proper so you don t feel completely congested yet there are enough amenities in the neighborhood that make it feel very cozy and convenient the staff at the hotel was unsurpassed they were helpful and knowledgeable about all areas of the city helping get to touristy locations with ease i will recommend this hotel to all of my friends that visit paris
