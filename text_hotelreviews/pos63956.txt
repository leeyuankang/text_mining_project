the room was perfectly fine nothing specifically that stood out we had the luck of finding a very good deal via booking com location is very convenient it is a minute walk to canary wharf station where you can take either underground or dls better even is the water bus which does not get so crowded and the air not so stifling if you are not in a rush and enjoy seeing the sights from the thames this is one of the best ways to travel into the city
