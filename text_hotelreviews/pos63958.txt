we liked everything about this hotel and was so so pleased you still have smoking rooms so good as my partner didn t have to leave me to go outside for a smoke and in the morning we were able to enjoy leisurely having our first coffee relaxing as he was able to have his cigarette this was our second trip to this hotel and will definitely be back
