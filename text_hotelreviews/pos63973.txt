the room was very spacious the window across the room made it light and airy and it was very welcoming the bathroom was very modern and there were mirrors everywhere making it even more spacious the bed was comfy the armchairs also the room was clean and well maintained the location of the hotel was fabulous and great value for money considering it is in the area of canary wharf the room was also cosy and old fashioned which considering the exterior made it feel homely inside the receptionist due to a fault with my booking upgraded me to a bigger room which i thought was very nice of her and she was very friendly even though i wasn t in the best of moods the room also had a great dressing room table with loads of space and a great mirror to make myself look half decent which was fab
