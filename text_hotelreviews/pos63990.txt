the room was very spacious and the buffet breakfast was good with plenty of choices to choose from a light breakfast to the full english it s also a good location as you are only about into the city of london and about from greenwich where i was visiting i didn t have much interaction with the staff but when i checked in the girl was very nice and helpful it was good value for money
