the location was great just across the road from the monorail station which brought us to the city centre within to minutes absolutely tremendous there was a really nice view from my room we were quite high up so we could see the entire city from our angle just across the road and down the street a little there was a small tesco supermarket which was great to purchase some late night snacks and fruit juices the bathroom was quite a good size there was room to move and shower the room temperature was good you just needed a little patience for it to get going after setting the desired temperature a great aspect of this hotel is the breakfast and dinner areas the breakfast was really great had everything you can want for a western breakfast buffet all of the food was cooked very well and the serving area was always kept clean and tidy dinner was superb very nice tasting cuisine and lovely staff to help if required it was a real pleasure to eat at this hotel it s one thing they ve done exceptionally well at a reasonable price for london
