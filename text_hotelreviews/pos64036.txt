i had booked a single room which comes without window but receptionist informed me he had upgraded me to a bigger room with window as the room type i had booked was unbearably hot highly appreciated as the city was under heatwave though the room was bit on the scruffy side tapestry and furniture worn out it was clean and had all basic amenities coffee tea making stuff hairdryer iron ironing board etc safety boxes are not available in the rooms but at reception
