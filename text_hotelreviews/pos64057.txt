we booked a room without a window but we were put in a lovely room with a window so we were delighted about that the fact the view showed over some construction didn t deter us as we were not expecting any view at all the room we were given was also larger than we were supposed to have gotten so that was an extra perk and especially because the price made it extra value the staff were lovely and welcoming on check in and it was just a pity that the staff in the bar were not as welcoming the view sitting the bar was really lovely as it sat right out onto the waterside which was really nice in either the morning or evening time to sit and relax
