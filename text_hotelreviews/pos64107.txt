we found the room very spacious with sofa tea and coffee maker facilities very comfortable beds we booked a special offer for nights in a room without window when we entered we found low temperature but reception offered us a small heating so ok we liked the room and bathroom clean every day position is really good easy access to canary wharf underground station and dlr only minutes walk it is a safe and quiet area beautiful view to the docklands friendly reception hotel offers leisure services and gym a restaurant and breakfast room but we didn t not use it good price quality in london internet service log in mins access per day useful we would definitely return here
