as already mentioned elsewhere this hotel is very dated and in urgent need of a facelift walking towards it you immediately see the difference in class between the novetel across the road and the very dated britainnia staff member on reception was efficient but with no friendliness what so ever no smile no enjoy your stay cleaner on the hand was helpful when we couldnt find our room and was friendly got a cheap room and only wanted somewhere cheap to crash served its purpose but if you have a little extra cash try elsewhere
