i ve stayed in this hotel or nights a week for the last weeks whilst working in london and will stay again in future i agree with others that the rooms are a little dated but they are clean comfortable and a good size for central london it is within walking distance of dlr stations i haven t eaten in the main restaurant but the pizzeria is reasonably good room service is good but there is a delivery charge there is a well equipped gym with swimming pool on site for a small charge
