we booked a double bed and it was two single beds screwed together and two single mattresses on top i had no sleep on the single bed at all as they were singles and not doubles as booked and with it being marathon weekend they were fully booked and we had to run the marathon the next day with no sleep and there was an awful noise from the lift going up and down all night so not happy at all and will be taking this further
