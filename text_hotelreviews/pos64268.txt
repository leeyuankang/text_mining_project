the staff were fantastic even tho the room was a little dated the view was incredible i have never opened the door to my hotel room to see a spiral staircase i was just like a child on christmas morning even after a long journey with heavy bags i shot up that staircase to be met with wall to wall windows looking out to canary wharf stunning
