the hotel was in a great location in canary wharf as it is a very short walk from the tube station when we got to the hotel they let us check in minutes early so that was great when we got to the room it was huge i really could not believe the size of the room for the price we paid we went for a no window room which was fine as again the space compensated for that the bed was comfy the bathroom was clean and the lounge area in the room was fantastic would definitely recommend to others
