this is a star hotel and i had a high expectation however pillows were very uncomfortable and a toilet bowl was very difficult to flush the room was a bit old but to be fair it was a good size and good view some of members of staff did not khow how to smile to customers also it was noisy during daytime because there was a building construction nearby
