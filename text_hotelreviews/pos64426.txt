reception staff were very helpful and explained everything well there was no heating on in the room when we arrived and it was very cold day and we requested for the heating to be switched on the housekeeping staff mentioned it was on a timer and did not come on until the evening they did bring us small electric heater which was not really adequate for the room the housekeeping staff could have been more friendly as they seemed not really happy to be working and when asked question they seemed not helpfull
