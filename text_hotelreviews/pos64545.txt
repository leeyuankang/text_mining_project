typical britannia decor and fittings circa but if you like a bit of retro really quite nice fantastic location if you are working in canary wharf or holidaying in millwall nice feel to the hotel as you walk in warm and friendly reception staff who give you a little upgrade when it s quiet and a large and comfy bedroom if you can get one of their cheaper deals what more could you ask for
