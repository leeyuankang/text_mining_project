we really enjoyed staying so much we booked an extra night friendly staff comfortable the size of room really spacious views only thing we didn t like which was our own fault was sunday our day ticket ran out and we were stranded taxi fare spoilt the end of our trip but we will definitely be interested in any special offers monthly from january onwards happy brtitania hotels are great
