first of all the hotel refused to amend my booking to either the following week or add a night on i had to make a completely separate booking then they wouldn t guarantee i wouldn t have to change rooms there were mice in the bar the heating wouldn t turn off in my room was told categorically that they do not do refunds the time delay in waiting for a response took over hrs although the manager when i did see him did swap my room the following night didn t help that night overall i didn t think paying nearly for nights was worth it
