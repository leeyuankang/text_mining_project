the hotel room had a lovely view and we found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful very pleasant stay and would certainty recommend a little out of town but not too far away quieter and very close to canary wharf tube station and both south quay and herons quay dlr stations too very conveniently minutes away from the hustle and bustle after a short ride quirky hotel too thank you
