we only stayed one night would recommend it for a short stay was really okay and the staff is very nice the only thing that bothered me was the location it was really far from where i had to be but if you dont care about such things its a really nice hotel pricey wifi but in the lobby it is free nice to have a drink and look at the water there are also rooms for smokers but i would recommend to smoke outside since you cant open the window
