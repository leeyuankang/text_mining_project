excellent friendly staff nothing too much trouble very clean rooms and overall throughout the hotel good choice of food in the hotel italian restaurant was excellent and good value too breakfast was very good too only complaint was my room was close to the stairs and there was a lot of loud voices on and off through the night maybe a polite notice for guests coming in late to respect that most other guests may be sleeping
