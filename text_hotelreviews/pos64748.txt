we only stayed one night but the hotel was very nice for a double room with ensuite bathroom with two single beds locked together comfortable enough the room was clean and so was the bathroom it was a good area for us and close to the gig we were going to we bought some fries to take to our room from the restaurant which were a good size and tasted nice overall a good experience and the staff were pleasant
