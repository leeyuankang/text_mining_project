i upgraded from a no window room only to be presented with a no smokinh room stinking of cigarettes the management did change the room but nothing else was offered to please me as a form of apology the decor is old and there was a lot of deep cuts on the walls overall not bad but i expected a bit more class and the wow factor wasn t really present would probably think twice before booking again unless desperate
