just stayed on business in canary wharf and i d be back in a heartbeat the staff are without exception friendly and go out of their way to help you there s a lovely pool and spa that only costs for a one off visit and the view from the river side is beautiful there s the odd frayed carpet but it s old and it s beautiful if a well loved hotel is going to put you off then go somewhere that s if you value a hotel with a heart this is a total bargain
