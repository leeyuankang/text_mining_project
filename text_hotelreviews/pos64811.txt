the location was good not so far from the canary warf underground some road work nearby made the access to the hotel a little longer the hotel was okay however the swimming pool was closed the entire weekend they said a flood had occurred the day we arrived and the staff kept saying the pool was going to open later on but that never happened we had a very upset little one who wanted to go swimming
