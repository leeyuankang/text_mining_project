probably the best hotel we have stayed in we had an excellent room on the first floor overlooking the water and canary wharf buildings amazing how many different birds there were to see the indian restaurant was nice and the breakfast very good the whole ambience of the reception and service was top quality especially for the price the car park was ideal when we drove up outside the entrance my wife said this can t be the right hotel but it was we shall go back again
