the hotel is like an old rich lady that s seen better days think of blanche dubois from the movie street car named desire yes its a bit tatty and frail but you can see vestiges of it s former glory around you huge bath tub that isnt environmentally friend but very comfortable high ceilings and lots of space in the public areas big windows letting in lots of light staff making up for it with bigger smiles but with a hint of yes we know i d stay here again
