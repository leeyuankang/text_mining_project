everything was amazing but the only negative comment i could possibly have was that the food was not what i guess i expected wasn t what i expected when told it was a carvery but many other choices to pick from other than that it s the best hotel i ve ever stayed at and my sons birthday treat was amazing and he simply thought the hotel was a palace xx
