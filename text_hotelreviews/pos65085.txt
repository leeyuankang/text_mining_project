food in the italian restaurant was really good staff were really helpful as i had recently broken my ankle and changed my room to be more accessible for me ie wet room bathroom even though i have seen the review of this hotel have been less that favourable i have stayed in this hotel now times over the last months and will continue to as it is so close to canary wharf and as a female business traveller find it comfortable rooms are very well facilitated and staff very friendly helpful and welcoming
