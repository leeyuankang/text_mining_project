liked the idea of how the hotel is laid out the staff are very friendly and helpful i cannot fault them in anyway they are a credit to their profession the location of the hotel is good even though its surrounded by building sites the surrounding building work makes access from canary wharf awkward and frustrating i loved the restaurants and swimming pool and i also think friday s bar is a great addition to the hotel even though the hotel is run down it s very clean and tidy and it does have some nice quirky features like the japanese statutes dotted around the place i loved them i think the sofas in the lobby are a nice and relaxing touch too while waiting for a cab or as a rendezvous point all in all its a nice enough hotel all be it a little disappointing when you consider what you are paying for it but it has the potential of being much better if a bit of money is spent on it considering its in the heart of london s financial district i was expecting a bit more refinement the hot tub in my room was clean but but very worn out also the carpet in the room is old worn out i had a good sizeroom but could definitely benefit with a bigger tv with the options of sky channels however the nice big bed and the linen were fresh and comfy theres a fantastic view from balcony of the docklands shame about all the building worksites at present it does spoil the view the room service menu is good and unexpectedly good value a mini bar and safe would be a great addition to the room wifi should be free considering the price you pay for the room i loved the iron spiral staircase in the room another great quirky feature all in all a nice hotel that could be so much more if the owners are willing to invest a little cash and attention to it it is rather run down and in a desperate need of freshening up for this reason alone i think it was over priced
