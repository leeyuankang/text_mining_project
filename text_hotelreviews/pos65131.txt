this hotel is getting much better i paid a little extra for a better room and it was really nice i stay in the wharf often and the price is good but in the past the hotel has been tacky and unattractive many of my colleagues won t stay here but i was impressed i don t ask for much from a hotel i m asleep most of the time a clean bed quiet a good shower and light switches i know how to use so was really pleased except
