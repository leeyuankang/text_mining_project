amazing value for centre of canary wharf and have stayed there on a few occasions for that reason it s outdated but location just great we ve stopped staying there now due to the lack of air conditioning in the rooms it was okay in the winter but in the warmer weather it s been unbearable at night as you can t open the windows the staff are generally helpful but there can be a long queue at check in i also left an item in the room and it was never returned they said it wasn t there even though i made a special trip to collect it luckily it was valuable to me but not irreplaceable
