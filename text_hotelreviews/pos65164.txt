didn t have breakfast thought it was a little pricey visited tesco s adjacent to the dlr bought some good espresso coffee camomile tea for me hot food and pain au vanille all for this was the price per person for breakfast on the morning would have bought at the hotel if a bit cheaper good ambience staff very attentive and professional drinks were cheap at the bar relaxing atmosphere great location in the heart of canary wharf where its all happening would recommend for business and leisure
