staff were indifferent and sullen i was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience i left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping i got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and i never heard from them about my items ever they also gave me a year old folding cot bed with a mattress to sleep on for nights i would have thought plus for nights would have afforded me a bed yes i complained and they relented eventually although the location is fantasticly placed i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away
