very good value for money a very clean and spacious building that boasts an aging grace whilst retaining elegance amidst plethora of surrounding and newer hotel chains my room was comfortable well facilitated and complimented the hotel style which i appreciated the hotel is well situated near canary wharf and other dlr stations
