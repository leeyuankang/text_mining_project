i was very lucky to have been upgraded to an executive lounge as it was my birthday i absolutely love the interior very suave the bed was indeed comfortable and all room facilities of good use i think the bathroom was my favourite with the huge mirrors and marble surfacing staff were always willing to help and answer any queries thank you
