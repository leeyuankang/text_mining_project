after managing to lose our car keys after a few too many cocktails the staff were so helpful and understanding the bar downstairs is beautifully situated on the river thames and prices were incredible along with the views after originally booking the hotel for one night and ending up staying for two the rooms were perfect well equipped with a decent sized tv and comfortable bed which was perfect for cheese and biscuits after a little too much wine the room sizes are lovely and big so there s plenty of space for getting ready and spreading different outfits all over the place the hotel itself was beautiful and clean this hotel is now our first choice for everytime we come back to london situated minutes from the tube and minutes away from a couple of quirky bars and a huge shopping mall highly recommend
