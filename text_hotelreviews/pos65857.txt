i like the privacy the convenient restaurants and the room service it could be a great place but the atmosphere is so unpleasant every time i arrive the cleaners and other staff are really good but in the front end you really need to make some changes to attitude of staff in a luxury hotel you expect politeness and a smile and welcome and some service not just a grmble and hand over your card and there s your key it really is discouraging
