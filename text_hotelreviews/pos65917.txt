i was nervous about staying here due to the reviews and experience in other britannia properties but with a change in number of people going at the last minute the original hotel booked wasn t available don t be nervous it s absolutely fine yes it s a bit run down eg some broken tiles in one of the bedrooms but as we didn t spend the majority our time in the bathroom the bedroom or the hotel we didn t mind it didn t affect us the rooms were clean the staff were polite and friendly when we came into contact with them the beds were comfortable the area is not central but you know that when you look at the map it depends what you want to do the price for a london hotel was fairly miraculous
