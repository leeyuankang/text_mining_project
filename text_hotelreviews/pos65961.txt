food in the pizzeria and spice restaurant was excellent and the service was great too rooms were comfortable and had all the facilities that we needed and the location was excellent being right in the heart of canary wharf and close to tube and dr links staff were friendly and helpful giving a lovely relaxed atmosphere to the hotel which was very welcome after a hard day we would definitely stay again
