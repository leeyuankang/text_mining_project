there was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel our room was very comfortable and a good size for a london hotel it was clean tidy and well equipped the staff were first class they were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot the breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality we will certainly pay a return visit
