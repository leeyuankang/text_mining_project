the staff were very helpful when we wanted to enquire about going out on trips they organised everything for us from ringing to ask how we get to the places where we want to go then calling us to let us know the prices and then calling back to book it for us they ordered taxis for when we needs to leave they went above and beyond to make our stay a relaxing one
