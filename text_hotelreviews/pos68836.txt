we were given an upgrade with a view of the eiffel tower which was a lovely surprise the staff are excellent and can t do enough to help even printing our return boarding passes for free size of the room was excellent considering that space is at a premium at a lot of paris hotels breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice and the hotel is in a good position and very close to the metro and bus stops
