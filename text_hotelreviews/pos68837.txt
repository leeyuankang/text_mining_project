if you want to escape the typical hotel chains and prefer personal cute parisian hotels this is for you you are in a beautiful historic building with little balconies i had a superior room and nice view over paris small rooms but incredible good room layout i love the location because you are next to a bus metro station you can walk to arc de triomphe or the eiffel tower and you have one of the best argentinian restaurants around the corner la recoleta romantic little neighborhood the breakfast is not the typical huge buffet from the hotel chains but perfect for us and really nice and fresh fresh fruit real scrambled eggs some ham and cheese and of course good bread and croissants as you would expect in france i find eur per person a bit overpriced but ok if you are a coffee junkie like me don t expect the best coffee but hey this is not italy
