location was a minutes walk from a metro station so great for getting about rooms were nice and clean it was a mini moon break for us and they left a note for a glass of champage each at the bar we didn t have time for this in the end but it was a nice gesture from the hotel i found the bed really comfortable and regardless of the intermitent water temp the shower had good pressure
