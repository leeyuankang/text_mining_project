the staff were brilliant especially the night porter who had to arrange an ambulance for me as i developed a suspected pulmonary embolism and needed urgent medical attention he was calm and attentive ensuring that i was safe and as comfortable as i could be he made a very stressful situation much less so and assisted with all the medical staff translating as required i wouldn t recommend you try out the above during your stay but rest assured that should the need arise you can be assured of a unparalleled professionalism and receive the best care
