the staff was exceptional super nice friendly and very helpful they made me feel at home they even gave me a free complimentary breakfast which was very yummy and delicious especially the chocolate croissant which were extra flaky and super fresh i honestly felt that the people in this hotel really cared and that s all that ever matters this is the best hotel i have ever been to hands down
