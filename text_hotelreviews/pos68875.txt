first while i travel frequently for both business and pleasure i never write reviews this is in fact the first time i ve ever written a review for any travel site and i m writing it because this hotel deserves it i loved the responsiveness of the staff in particular rudy prior to our arrival and their helpfulness and friendliness i also loved the room itself it was spacious clean and beautifully decorated the small balcony with a view of the arc de triumph and eiffel tower was wonderful
