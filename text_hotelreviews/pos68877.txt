we had a wonderful stay and loved our time at hotel de banville we thoroughly recommend staying here as it was close to the metro and in a quiet and clean neighbourhood the staff were magnificent particularly the beautiful young lady on the front desk who was so helpful polite and accomodating we stayed in marie a top floor suite with glorious views of the eiffel tower even from the bath breakfasts are very tasty with lots on offer tuesday evenings are a pleasant surprise with the owner entertaining guests staying here with her own singing unfortunately she was away in the time we stayed but i m told she puts on food and drinks for the guests while she performs very kindly we were given a copy of her cd to keep as we missed the performance im enjoying remembering our stay while i listen to it and look forward to staying here again
