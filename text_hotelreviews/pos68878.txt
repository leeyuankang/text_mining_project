beautiful hotel in a fantastic location we stayed for our weekend honeymoon and loved everything the room was spotlessly clean and very quiet we were close to a metro station and were able to come and go as we pleased the room was quite spacious and everything we could have wanted was provided from toiletries robes right down to free wifi and a minibar i would highly recommend this hotel the staff were friendly and attentive helped us with directions ordered taxis and stored our luggage after check out from us
