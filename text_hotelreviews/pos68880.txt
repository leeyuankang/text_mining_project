the hotel was so nice to come back to after a busy day of exploring paris i liked how close it was to the tube station porte de champerret i think that s spelt correctly would have been useful to know beforehand which stop it was comfy bed nice clean bathroom with complimentary shampoo soap etc a very chic boutique it feels very parisian and the staff were very helpful
