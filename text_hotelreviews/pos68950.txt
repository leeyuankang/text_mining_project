the staff was helpful especially aida when we checked in loved the decor actually my grandson i was a little hesitate about staying away from main tourist attractions but as it was our last day so we really enjoyed getting to know the locals the quaint shops in the area more besides it was closer to the airport they had a shuttle that got us there in plenty of time
