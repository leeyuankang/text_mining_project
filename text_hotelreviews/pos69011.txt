i was impressed by how well sound proofed the windows were we were on the ground floor near the road and i was expecting to hear the traffic noise but it was nice and peaceful with the exception of an occasional police siren which you would hear on any floor great location was great being able to get the train to euston on a friday night and just walk across the road to the hotel very handy for the tube and only a few stops to most of the main sights staff friendly and polite also held our luggage for us after check out which was a big help
