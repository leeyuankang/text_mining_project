we really enjoyed the breakfast best thing about the stay the service was excellent and all the staff very helpful and pleasant efficient and professional loved the way they offered us extra pancakes and served delicious waffles at the table too the bacon was a little overcooked though a reasonable price for central london the area is very historic and interesting
