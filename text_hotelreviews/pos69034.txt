this was a last minute stay as we had to change from a flight from southampton to a train from st pancras for a new year s break the hotel was picked for its location as a very easy walk to the international station it was clean comfortable and after a stressful day caused by fog cancellations and travel plans going horribly wrong we were very happy with our accommodation for the night
