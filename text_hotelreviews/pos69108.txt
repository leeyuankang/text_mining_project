the lobby staff were uncomfortably unhelpful and slightly rude this tarnished the experience for me as i ve stayed in many hilton establishments prior and have never experienced this treatment the waiter and waitresses at breakfast were a different story however so helpful polite and made us feel extra special and as though nothing was too much to ask for could do with passing some of this on to the desk lobby staff
