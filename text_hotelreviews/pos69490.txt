the egerton house was a wonderful respite in london after traveling through the country in contrast to some negative comments about the staff we found all of the staff to be very engaged and very helpful they were extremely helpful in finding a physician for both of us because we both had developed sinus infections while traveling but their service and help went well beyond that everyone was always courteous and very responsive to all of our requests the location of egerton house is excellent but yet it is located in a quiet beautiful neighborhood it was like having our own pied de terre in london we will definitely return there on our next london visit
