reception staff friendly helpful actual stay had initial booking then added earlier dates but overall stay moved twice during stay but only after complaints original room type booked could not accommodate person comfortably despite room description being applicable for people eventually moved to a suite at reasonable additional cost that i paid as my granddaughter visited us for a few nights and only with the suite was it comfortable enough
