the staff were very helpful and extremely welcoming beth in particular made it special i mentioned it was a birthday treat and on returning to our room i found a small cake and happy birthday iced on the plate they also happily held onto our luggage safely after checking out this allowed us to have a full day in london before heading home definitely will use hotel again due to the friendliness of the staff alone
