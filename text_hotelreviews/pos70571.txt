amazing boutique hotel so close to all the sights the hotel has an air and charm reminiscent of times gone by and at the same time is modern and relevant the rooms are so amazing and chique best of all if you want a room with a view well there is nowhere else in paris where you can get such a birds eye view of the eiffel tower and the sacr c ur together we spent a wonderful weekend there and would definitely return oh and did i mentiion the roof terrace where they serve the most amazing cocktails and champagne whilst you admire paris at it s best
