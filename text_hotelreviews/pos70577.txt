it s a five star so it s hard to knock it for much except cost an amazing hotel in an amazing location in paris just min walk from the arc du triomph the staff is suburb and very friendly and food was very good make sure you book a reservation for the roof top bar well in advance or you won t get a seat the food within the hotel is very expensive but there are plenty of food options within walking distance the rooms are very well maintained and the wifi was perfect if it s good enough for audrey hepburn and george clooney it s good enough for you treat yourself an unforgettable experience in paris
