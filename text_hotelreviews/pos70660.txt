we stayed here as my daughter is living in paris this year and it is near her apartment in the i know paris well and from here it is easy to walk to lots of famous monuments and galleries the rooms are comfortable especially the beds and there are rooms with walk in showers the most important thing though was that the staff were so friendly and chatty which dare i say is not always the case in paris hotels they could not have been more helpful tip i set up an uber account on my phone as i had my elderly mother with me and this proved invaluable
