the hotel is very close to an underground station giving great access and with an array of different types of restaurants within a few minutes walk made it ideal also being on a quite road means you get a good nights sleep in the comfortable bed and being able to sit downstairs and relax with a drink is an added bonus but above all the staff were great pleasant and knowledgeable
