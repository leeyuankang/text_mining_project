the location cannot be beat the staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person i made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk all i asked was whether i should dial o before the number in paris in addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve all in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere the cleanliness can t be beat and i would certainly book there again
