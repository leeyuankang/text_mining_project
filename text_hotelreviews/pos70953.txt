the hotel is clean and lovely as an american i was thrilled with options for breakfast such as eggs mueslis yogurt the staff was friendly and very helpful the one restaurant they recommended ended up being our favorite out of a week stay and it was reasonably priced it is a very convenient location so we walked everywhere we will go back
