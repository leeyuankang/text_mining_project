this is a fantastic hotel in a great location so pleased we found it the only hotel we have stayed in where you couldn t hear the air con in fact it was so quiet we didn t think it was working we only stayed for two nights but would be happy to return very clean and comfortable and good sized rooms short walk to underground and shops
