this was a very kid friendly hotel with a welcome gift for both kids on arrival as well as children s entertainment during breakfasts the room was fairly spacious and i really appreciated the shower and tub as well as separate toilet facilities i really felt we got value for money and the cherry on top was a late checkout at at no extra cost when our flight was departing at that night
