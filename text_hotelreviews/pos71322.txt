we stayed with our four children in two adjoining rooms and it was very pleasant the rooms were just as pictured very neat and tidy they had the extra beds already made for us which was very nice they spoke english and had their own car garage just underneath the hotel also we accidentally left our passports in our safe and the staff found them and took them to the front desk to hold for us so that was very appreciated
