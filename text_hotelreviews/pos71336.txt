after spending more than finding the hotel after leaving the metro we was just happy to finally find it when we walked in the door first impressions were good we then went to reception to book our bags in and was told we could have our room more than hrs early reception staff spoke very good english and were very polite and could not do enough for us the rooms were very clean with free toiletries and a free mini bar re stocked every day the beds were very comfortable as was the whole room and hotel breakfast was very nice and plentiful both times we had breakfast there were free activities for the children our two teenage children especially liked the body painting and didn t want to wash the artwork off their arms and legs this hotel made our stay in paris and we would give it the best rating possible
