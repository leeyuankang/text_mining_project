we had two rooms for our family the beds were comfortable and had plenty of pillows we have been traveling in a few different countries and this has been one of the best hotels thus far my kids enjoyed playing foosball babyfoot in the lobby to pass the time between activities they liked the breakfast offerings and i was happy they had a kettle on the room with tea and coffee
