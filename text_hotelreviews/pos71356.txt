this hotel is really well located for a tourist to view the sights of paris the amazing eiffel tower view just metres from the hotel door is a bonus we found it much nicer and cheaper to eat in the nearby montparnasse restaurants definitely not the overpriced paris that you are warned about hotel was of usual novotel excellent standard with the comfiest bed in the world just what you want after a day trekking around the city with small children
