so happy i picked this hotel would have loved to stay longer but we were only in paris for one night it was a short walk to montparnasse so the kids got to see the fabulous night skyline with the eiffel tower the beds were so comfortable we didn t want to get up the breakfast was great selection of tasty foods to choose from the staff were very helpful gave the kids a small gift on our arrival will definitely choose this hotel again for our next trip to paris close to the metro for visiting all the sites
