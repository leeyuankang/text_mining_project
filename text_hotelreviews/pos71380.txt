what i did like was the morning breakfast chef at the buffet at least he smiled and said good morning when he brought out the hot food even though he cooked the same every morning the buffet breakfast was like first in best served chaos at the best people scrambling pushing food exactly the same every morning pile of fatty bacon tasteless scrambled eggs and small sausages no change and if that is not enough at times the waitresses didn t even want to let you in only if you piled up what you wanted to eat at one time only and then sit down never ever again would i stay or even recommend this hotel i have had better at mining camps in the middle of the west australian desert thanks peter woroniuk
