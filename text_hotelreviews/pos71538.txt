liked the location as it was within a nice residential area plenty of bars restaurants plus bakery supermarkets metro only a short walk away we were on the floor room nice and quiet staff very friendly large clean room hot room but there is a c large comfy bed huge bathroom with bath and great shower it would have been nice to have had a plug for the bath we did ask and it wasn t delivered toilet was separate with no sink good to have a coffee machine and safe interesting lighting and decor would recommend
