the reception staff were incredibly helpful talked us through navigating paris and made the whole hotel experience a lot better room was clean incredibly well decorated and funky superb use of led lighting plus the hotel is in a perfect location quiet at night close to a great boulangerie and minutes from the metro you could pay double and stay in a far worse hotel than this
