the staff were amazing we arrived just before midnight and the guy behind the desk was so nice as were all the women the next few days even though we were clearly backpackers staying nights for a birthday staying in a nice hotel we still felt extremely welcome by all the staff when i booked the room i asked for a specific style room i had seen when i looked at photos and i got it no problem it was probably the coolest hotel room i d ever been in the location was great really close to a metro stop and there was free coffee and tea and little croissants in the lobby
