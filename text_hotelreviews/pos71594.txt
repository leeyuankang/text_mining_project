the location in the city was very fun we had stayed in the seventh a week before so it was nice to have a different experience it is very close to almost everything easy access to the metro and walking distance to all of the restaurants i had chosen breakfast was perfect for us in the lobby very cute and just what we like to eat coffee croissants yogurt juice im sure if you wanted something more it would have been maybe feet away anyway it was a fun stay in a cute boutique hotel
