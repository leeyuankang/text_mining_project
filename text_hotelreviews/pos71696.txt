i found the hotel to be very good for what i paid the hotel facilities as well as the room were clean and in order and i found the room to be very comfortable in addition the staff were courteous and friendly as for location there are good transport links with the station just next door and plenty to see and do in the cutty sark area a short walk from the hotel
