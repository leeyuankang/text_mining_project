the location is excellent just a short walk from all the attractions of greenwich and the hotel is clean modern with good facilities the staff really helpful and friendly the beds just right had a superior room on the railway side we could hear the trains when i asked about this they moved us with no fuss to a quieter room over the lobby on the floor we were disturbed by vehicles all night
