great location and was very quiet despite being near bars the hotel was clean and the room was very comfortable close to bus stops that go further into greenwich and up into blackheath but also an easy walk to anywhere in greenwich my room had a lovely view and the room was never too cold the bed was comfortable and i liked the couch in the room overall i really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be looking to novotel the next time i am in greenwich
