a brilliant stay i booked this hotel literally the night before and i got a fantastic rate less than for a sunday night in london the staff were very helpful the bathroom spotless a very quiet room considering it is in zone not far from baker street i slept a lot better than expected the hotel is a min walk from both baker street and marylebone so you are never far from good connection
