good location easy to find from baker st underground station staff were friendly helpful the room was clean and very comfortable it was a basement room so it was a little bit dark but we were only staying for one night so it wasn t a problem if we had been staying longer i would have preferred to have a room on a higher floor with windows that can open facilities in the room were great lovely clean bathroom with a good shower breakfast was very nice there was a good range of traditional continental options
