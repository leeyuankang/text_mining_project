this is a pretty standard joint no frills but solid and a short walk to baker street and all the yummy cafes there there is no elevator but the porter is very willing to help and i appreciated that in fact all the staff were really great it was pretty clean although there were some stains in the carpet and on the bedspread but anyway don t you generally remove the bedspread at hotels
