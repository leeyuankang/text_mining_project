very helpful staff when we arrived earlier than check in they allowed us to store luggage and fill out our registration form etc so we could go and explore london without having to take our case with us when we did arrive back to check into our room our luggage was brought up to our room for us very helpful polite staff the room was small but more than adequate for what we needed free wifi tea and coffee facilities within the room and a microwave to use also no fridge although it stated the rooms were equipped with one but it wasn t a problem at all this is my second stay here
