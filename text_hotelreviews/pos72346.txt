very welcome and helpful staff during our short stay room was very neat and tidy with all facilities required on hand bathroom clean and modem with good quality towels a must for me would use the hotel again as it is very convenient for baker street station and local eating places one particulate bonus in staying a smaller hotel is the quietness due to the lack of traffic noise which can be an issue when i have stayed in a more centrally located hotel
