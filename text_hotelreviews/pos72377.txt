the reception and bell staff were not only polite but extremely helpful they kept our baggage safe for us whilst we explored london and helped us to move our baggage up to our room once we d finished polite professional and despite the room being on the smaller the amenities were more than sufficient for people who were looking for comfortable and clean accommodation in london with good links to both regents park and the tube national rail services
