very friendly welcome upon arrival as i was very ill that day and therefore exhausted from my travels i really appreciated that i was able to get an early check in between am so i could get some rest before meeting my friends in the city later that day check in was done quickly payment upon arrival and the staff offered me a mobile phone for the duration of my stay which i did not need they also gave me the wifi password and then a porter kindly carried my suitcase up the narrow staircase to my room on the first floor the single room was very small but i ve never known them to be any different in london it was lovely and clean which is what matters most inside the wardrobe there was a small safe a microwave which i didn t use and a kettle together with an assortment of instant coffee tea sugar and some rather good cookies it also offered a large bottle of still water which was lovely the tee coffee and cookies were replaced every day there was also a flatscreen tv installed at the wall at the foot end of the bed which i never turned on the bathroom was nice with a good shower adequate water pressure is a matter of luck in british hotels but this one was just fine the room was cleaned and towels replaced every day the bed was surprisingly comfortable and also much to my surprise i found the hotel room to be pleasantly quiet i didn t hear much of the other guests at all and since my room didn t face the street i certainly didn t hear any traffic either i know the sound of the streets was a point of complaint for some reviewers but since it s not an overly busy street and there was barely any traffic at night i genuinely can t imagine that having a room with a window facing the street would have been much worse baker street station is about a minute walk away from the hotel as a huge sherlock fan i got a kick out of being able to walk past baker street every day
