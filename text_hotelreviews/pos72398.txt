good location and the staff were pleasant welcoming and helpful i had a problem with the heating in the room far too warm for me a not unusual problem in hotels when i asked if it was possible to do something about it a member of staff was knocking on my door in five minutes and the issue sorted i will certainly stay here again when next in london
