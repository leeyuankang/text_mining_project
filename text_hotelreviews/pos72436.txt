had a double room room was clean bathroom relatively modern rain shower and it was just enough space for a solo traveller pro of the hotel was handy a smartphone with restrictions and internet connection you could lend with no extra fee to pay the phone itself was a bit old so it was slow oh huge con is that i couldn t use the handy phone for wifi hotspot with that it would ve been better but al least i could use it for navigation and web browsing during my trip also the nearest underground station baker street has a great connection to travel to most places since many lines stop there also i was lucky to have a ground floor room since there was no lift for my heavy luggage d
