room was very clean and well equipped microwave coffee and tea fridge wifi worked perfectly and we even had this free thing that looks like a mobile phone that you can use to surf the internet or explore the city and more the bed was really comofrtable and the location is just perfect close to oxford street and regent park and for those who fly from luton it is super close to the bus stop
