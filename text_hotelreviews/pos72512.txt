i booked a deluxe single room though small it was perfectly adequate for night it was comfortable and clean with modern decor i asked for a high floor due to poor reviews of the basement rooms the room was airy and bright but the lack of a lift made it quite a climb floor that said the concierge carried my bag upstairs for me which was appreciated
