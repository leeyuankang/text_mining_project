nice boutique hotel in a quiet street nearby marylebone tube abt mins walk room is clean neat with all amenities plus point with microwave the only downside is hotel no lift so if stay at floor need to drag the luggage up n down which is a bit of hassle otherwise nice stay checkin and checkout smooth
