the room was comfortable updated not too noisy although we were on the street location ideal for both marylebone and bakerloo lines staff appeared willing to help and were friendly we felt safe it is nice to have a kettle with facilities to make tea or coffee in the room and to have a small fridge and microwave i went down to the desk three times to request extra water and clean glasses and the young men on duty were very kind while i did not like having to go down it was not their fault that there were small problems they were most professional
