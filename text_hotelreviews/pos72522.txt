a nice small hotel in a good location minutes walk to the nearest baker street tube rooms are small but are very modern well equipped and have comfortable beds staff was very helpful wifi worked well this is great value for money for a single business or leisure traveller who is just looking for a modern room in a new hotel to sleep but for two people this is not likely to work due to very small space
