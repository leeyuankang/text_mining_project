the location of the hotel is marvellous within short walking distance of baker street tube station personnel friendly our room was ok and clean beds good and with nice tasteful decoration bathroom ok nice toiletries available wifi worked great though no password required safe there were coffee and tea facilities and cookies on the house new every day for a hotel in this part of london with this service level the pricing is ok
