great location being only a minute walk from george v metro station which is in view of the arc di triomphe and then another minutes or less to be standing in front of it lots of restaurants around and the main street by the metro is very lively and good atmosphere the staff were also friendly and helpful good selection for the breakfast buffet and the gentleman that worked there was very friendly
