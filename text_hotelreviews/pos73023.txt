my room was street facing but no noise from the busy traffic at all the walk in shower yes no bathtub here is working great but be advised that the entire floor gets wet as the divider is to short i guess housekeeping is okay with this the room has enough storage and a window you can fully open good internet and the option to connect the pc with hdmi to stream netflix there is a nice little bar restaurant next door with a small terrace very busy so do come early you can eat and drink for a very affordable price and good quality the decoration of reception and breakfast room is not to my taste seems a bit chaotic with bling bling everywhere but it s not a bother for me staff is very friendly and speak very good english i would book again
