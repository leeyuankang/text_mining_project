chain run establishment old parisian building done up nicely and in a modern style on the inside very sweet staff coffee they do serve breakfast but we chose to buy fresh croissants and coffee at the local bakery which were great so cannot comment on the breakfast but people were certainly eating there location is sort of mixed at a macro level its in a good area at a specific level it is a brisk walk from the metro but there are local buses that stop outside and taxis are plentiful as is uber and to get to the opera area etc its a bit of a hike on foot rooms beds showers all great we got there at noon but couldn t get the room till official check in time so had to mark time but that s not unusual the view from our room looked like the first bourne movie when matt damon goes to paris wide streets with massive trees and classical buildings cars and bikes parked on both sides we would stay there again
