the hotel is very good as it is in a great location literally min from champs elysees the staff was very friendly and helpful they offer a mobile wifi to use outside of the hotel for euros a day and it can have multiple phones in use i have never seen that before and i always spend lots of money buying internet the hotel was clean and the value was great i recommend this hotel
