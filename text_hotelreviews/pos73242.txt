we were greeted by one the most friendliest staff and quickly found out all the staff were amazingly friendly but this one young lady in particular made me fall in love with paris she was attentive to our needs helped us in and around the city and was just a breath of fresh air to walk down to each morning the location of this boutique hotel is central to everything metro is mtrs away the best restaurants around are just around the corner the bedroom is a little small but the bathroom made up for that i mean for its location it is understandable i cannot recommend highly enough this accommodation and the staff fantastic it made our time in paris truly memorable thank you
