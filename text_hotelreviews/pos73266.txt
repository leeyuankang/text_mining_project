the bed was the best good size and very comfortable the reception bar and restaurant staff were very polite and extremely helpful when coming to london again i would consider a return visit to malmaisson the tube station was easily accessed only mins from hotel the food in restaurant was excellent but we only visited once as were busy other nights
