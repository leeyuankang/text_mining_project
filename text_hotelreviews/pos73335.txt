we really liked the location it was not in a touristy section so we weren t overwhelmed by crowds traffic and noise it was close to the metro which made it easy to get around but it was also walking distance to some good tourist sites if we preferred to walk there were several good pubs and restaurants steps away from our front door and the room was a good size by the way the hotel s lady in red was awesome she quickly resolved any issue we had during our stay my guess is she was the concierge but we never asked
