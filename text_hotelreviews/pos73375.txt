we enjoyed our time here so much very clean and modern room beautifully decorated comfortable huge bed luxury hotel and when we booked months earlier it was pretty cheap too with darkening curtains you could get the room very dark so it was very pleasant to sleep no noise air conditioning worked really well which was a blessing cause it was degrees outside staff was very friendly and helpful they held our packbags the whole day when we checked out location is good only minute walk to the metro station min walk to most of the turist attractions if you prefer walking like we did warmly recommend this hotel for everyone nothing bad to say
