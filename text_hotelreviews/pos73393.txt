i love this location in real london its not far away from touristic zones yet is delightfully authentic with smithfield market on the doorstep and the city and islington within walking distance there are local bars and restaurants to choose from and taking breakfast at one of the cafes used by the meat market workers is so much more enjoyable and half the price than eating in the hotel the hotel is stylish and accommodation is very comfortable with good space in both the bedroom and bathroom it also resists the temptation of some malmaison s to over furnish the room and cover all surfaces with food and drink like a market stall a very good quality of stay
