the room was very well decorated and very comfortable small enough to be cosy but large enough to have space for all items we brought with us the staff were very helpful and friendly asked for a message in the room as it was my girlfriends birthday and they had left a cake and a birthday card on arrival nice touch really good location only a five minute walk to barbican or farringdon station which both happened to have engineering works when i stayed still only a ten minute walk from chancery lane station though
