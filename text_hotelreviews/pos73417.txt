the location was great easy access to tubes and walking distance to many attractions room was comfortable although too hot but most hotel rooms are too warm room had everything we needed mini bar tea making facilities plenty of wardrobe space etc shower was good with plenty of hot water and good pressure i think what makes this hotel great is the very friendly helpful staff obi in the bar was fantastic makes a mean martini espresso and has a great sense of humour the breakfast team were also very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in how our day was and what we had planned the reception manager was a great help and swapped our room with no problem or fuss she was also very friendly and helpful all the staff we came into contact with were great and a credit to the hotel
