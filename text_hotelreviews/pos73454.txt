we stayed here just one night en route very nice modern hotel the staff very helpful very friendly and always offered extras we might have needed also reminded us that they would always try to reserve our room next time we visit if we liked it took care of our luggage for us as needed the room itself was very cosy large by london standards well equipped huge flatscreen marvellous shower fast wifi the works really charterhouse square itself is very historic and just a short walk to both barbican and farringdon tube stations overall smart hotel with slick staff who smile watch out for the ghosts
