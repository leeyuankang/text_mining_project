everything the room the service the staff the food the quiet but central location it s all brilliant if your looking for a bit of luxury at a decent price this is the place to stay i stayed in room which is classed as a standard room and to say it exceed all of my expectations is an understatement from the waterfall shower that s gigger than my bath to double bed that is blatantly bigger than a double to the breakfast being brought straight to your door it s all brilliant they knew we were there for our anniversary so on arrival had a cake and card waiting for us the food is amazing and the staff are so so lovely we are already booking to go back in august i would recommend to anybody
