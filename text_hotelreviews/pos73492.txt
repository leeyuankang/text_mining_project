absolutely loved staying here from start to finish much nicer than we originally expected mainly due to me not doing my research and just booking the cheapest hotel i could find on here turns out we had an amazing deal if you have time and have a chance please try their brasserie downstairs the food is absolutely to die for we were lucky enough to be able to have a sunday brunch in the run up to christmas so the value for money was second to none starting with soup then a salad tapas buffet followed by a choice of mains we went for the prime rib of black angus beef expected a small portion received a big plate with a great portion of top quality food and followed by a choice of desserts all that for you simply cannot do better than that
