my husband and i got married on the october this year we chose the malmaison barbican hotel because it was a minute drive to our wedding venue even though the malmaison is a chain the staff made us feel like part of their family from the moment we stepped foot into the hotel we were greeted with a glass of champagne and our bags taken straight to our room we found the staff to be very consensus at all times they went beyond their duty to make sure we had a good nights sleep before our special day can t thank everyone enough x
