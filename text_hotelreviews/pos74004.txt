the hotel had this fantastic mobile device that gave you free data and phone calls whilst in and around london i saved the battery on my phone and used theirs for google maps and checking out information whilst away from the hotel will go back to the hotel again just for this made my life much easier as my mobile battery is always flat when i use too much data
