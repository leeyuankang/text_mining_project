the location was perfect in a safe quiet beautiful neighborhood but also close to the tube and lots of action our room was spacious and immaculate with a large walk in closet and huge well equipped bathroom staff was friendly and always ready to help the lounge was a perfect place for a nightcap after a busy day out on the town great for couples we d stay here again in a heartbeat
