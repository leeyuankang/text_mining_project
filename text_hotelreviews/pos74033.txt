i was only there for night but the staff were great room great nice big room hard to get in london at this price i was upgraded i had to get to heathrow was happy it was on the blue tube line so easy cheap to get to the airport approx mins walk with luggage didn t have breakfast or get chance to try most of the facilities as i was out about so can t comment on them compared to other hotels in similar areas it was good value for money
