hotel in city centre i was expecitng little bit noisy place but you couldnt hear anything people in other rooms or cars outside for minute i thought we are only customers there well done when we arrived we were told that our room was upgrated which was nice room nice clean and enough room for couple we stayed in room breakfast from self service buffet plenty options another good thing hotel is less than mins walking from tube stations so if you visiting london to see many things during short time its really handy so my next time in london i ll be staying here again once again thank you stan
