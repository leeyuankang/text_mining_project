the room was clean and i enjoyed the toiletries overall my stay was reasonably up to standard the staff were friendly and the maids did their job well i loved the sound system in the room i thought that was very convenient as i do enjoy to listen to music when i get ready the safe was spacious which i also thought was very nice the bedding was nice and crisp easy on the touch and the tv was large and conveniently placed with lots of channels to enjoy i also really liked the fact that you had to take a little staircase to the bathroom i found that very sweet and rustic
