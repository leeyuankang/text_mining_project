we liked the friendly welcome when we checked in compared to other places we have stayed in london this place was very quiet and the bed was comfortable we had a tastefully furnished spacious room and there was everything we could have wished for supplied in the room plentiful good quality toiletries and even complimentary bottled water in the fridge we will certainly make this our regular place to stay whilst we are in london
