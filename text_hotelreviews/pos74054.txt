this hotel was in a great location for walking to earls court station to enjoy all the sites you are only minutes away from harrods and kensington palace you don t need to use the tubes all the time you could walk there within minutes we stayed in a triple room which had plenty of room for all of us without feeling like we were on top of each other the room was very clean and tidy the staff were very helpful when you needed them the hotel also let us leave our bags until our flight later on and even booked us a taxi to be there for us collecting our bags i would maybe stay here again if i couldn t get anywhere else in london
