i was given a room in their new floor and it was amazing the room feels very cozy and modern with comfortable bed they have a smart tv with some pay to play new movies installed which is a big plus for me as a movie enthusiast that barely have enough time to go to a cinema the breakfast was delicious and totally worth the price their dinner service at the chino latino restaurant within the hotel has a limited food choice and very limited wine options but the food is great room service food was very tasty too the hotel is located next to the river thames with some taxis available on the hotel entrance it s about minutes walk from the city center
