yes the eggs were extra fluffy and the bed was fine we paid extra for a room with a view which made the stay extra wonderful the grandchildren however had an inside view with no view whatsoever easy riverside walks to three bridges going into the city of westminster the breakfasts though expensive were worth not having to go out and search the best part of the hotel was the concierge staff bradley and tony and the others helped us immensely for tours taxis and airport runs the staff at the desk were so calm and helpful and professional being on the south side of the river after maybe trips staying in the west end was a new experience the rose pub just down the street had top rate pub food
