the hotel room was much more than i expected with little gimmicks like the control pad next to the bed to open or close the electronic curtains which made the whole experience that bit more luxurious and extravagant the bed was lovely and comfortable and the bathroom was great the room was spotless and a fantastic size given the fact you re in london we stayed in the standard room but still had a view of the river london which was beautiful it was just a really great place to stay
