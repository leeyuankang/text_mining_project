concierge staff were excellent polite knowledgeable and friendly checking in and out process was fairly efficient but there often seemed to be a queue we used the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner the a la cartel menu at breakfast was value for money as we had only booked for a room we enjoyed the shared dessert platter at dinner
