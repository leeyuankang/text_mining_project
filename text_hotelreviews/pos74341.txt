very near and on the same side of the river as the eye and lambeth palace history buffs also caught the water taxi from the eye to greenwich good buses near by some good pubs and restaurants vauxhall tube station is about blocks all in all a good choice this is more a business class hotel food and drink were a bit pricey so we relied on other locations nearby there was a very cool pub directly across the street a converted small deck boat that was very popular and from which you have great views of the eye westminster and traffic on the river and it was very reasonable
