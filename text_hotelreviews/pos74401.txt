the hotel is very prestigious rooms clean and very spacious although we did get a free upgrade to a junior suite bathroom clean and toiletries supplied excellent towels fluffy beds little hard but i dont mind that pillows lovely and bouncy room service excellent cheap and extremely high quality location good just a short walk to london eye and all attractions
