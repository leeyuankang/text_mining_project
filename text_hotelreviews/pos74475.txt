the rooms were beautiful very clean and loads of space the location was excellent only min walk to westminster our room didn t have a great view but we didn t pay to upgrade to a room with a view so we weren t expecting one the staff were very helpful and very friendly couldn t do enough for you we were only there one night we wished we had stayed longer
