the service was excellent and the rooms with the river views were absolutely amazing everybody was very polite and the whole hotel was very tidy and modern the location of the hotel is great because it s just so close to everything and it was easy to get a cab from right outside the hotel entrance we would definitely book this hotel again thank you for a memorable stay
