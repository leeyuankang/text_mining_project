i loved the location the staff were very friendly i didn t like how i was told on arrival i had to pay another pounds security and would get it back when leaving i had not been told about this when booking and had not budgeted for it as a result i had to hold back on my london experience with my yr old son who s time it was away from home that pounds was no use to me on the day we were going home i ve never been asked for that security deposit before in a uk hotel
