the restaurant serving asian style food was excellent and would recommend it a couple of snags i ordered coconut and date cheesecake which certainly looked good and was tasty but sadly tasted very much like strawberries and hazelnuts the staff were adamant it was what i ordered mmmm the other snag was the printing on the menu with red lighting predominant the red printing disappeared from sigh on the menu
