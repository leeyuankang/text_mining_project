this hotel is lush and the staff friendly and committed it is walking distance from the action in london and a pleasant walk at that since its a riverside location you can relax at the end of day with no more crowds around you and you can look around and see an illuminated landscape at least a mile long in each direction which is always a welcome wind down from the hussle and bustle which is also the attraction in london
