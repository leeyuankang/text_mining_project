only the location would preferred another hotel this was not worth the money we paid and got told when booked it we get breakfast included and arrived to find out breakfast is per person and the hotel room wasn t cleaned the best and when we arrived they hold another on top of the money you paid until you leave to make sure you don t damage anything in room etc do not reccomend this hotel
