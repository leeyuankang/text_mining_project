the staff at riverbank park plaza are excellent if there is a problem at a hotel i find it better to judge by how that problem was delt with opposed to the actual problem that occurred as sometimes things do not go to plan i found the staff excellent when i bought the problem to their attention i also especially liked the shop located a minutes walk away
