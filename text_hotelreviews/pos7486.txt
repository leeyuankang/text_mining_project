the staff were all very friendly and attentive the food was superb my year old great nephew could barely believe the breakfast enough food to feed an army served by a waitress who deserves special commendation very professional cheerful and obliging the porters were also all very helpful the lobby bar is well worth a visit the hotel is within easy reach of many of the west end theatres and other attractions
