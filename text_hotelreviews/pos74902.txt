had an amazing stay here the hotel even gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco for my birthday which was amazing to walk into after having travelled so far staff were extremely helpful and friendly especially the concierge staff and the lovely doorman with the grey suit and top hat big thank you to the guest relations manager for sorting the lovely surprise for my birthday the hotel was absolutely beautiful and the beds were amazing the only thing i will say is that the construction was a little annoying but couldn t be helped and the food was quite pricey and i didn t justify spending per person on a breakfast but that didn t matter wonderful stay
