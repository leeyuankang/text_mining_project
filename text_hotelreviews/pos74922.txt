the free room upgrade was great i have always considered all accommodation as simply being somewhere to lay your head but the river view was amazing watching the world come to life at was absolutely beautiful and so appreciated i ve definitely been converted now all front of house staff were polite attentive and approachable location wise the hotel is about a minute walk from waterloo station just the other side of the lambeth bridge so central london is easily within walking distance
