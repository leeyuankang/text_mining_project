the location is fantastic covent garden literally around the corner right next door to the lion king and mumma mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better we went with a group of to celebrate our daughter s birthday from the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful we received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group the bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to wardour street which i would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly the doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free all in all one aldwych is now our favourite london hotel and that is really down to the staff and location they also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options thank you so much for making our daughter s big day so lovely
