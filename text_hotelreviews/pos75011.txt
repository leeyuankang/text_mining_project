the hotel location was convenient located within walking distance to the london eye and big ben there was always a black cab waiting outside the hotel for when we wanted to travel a bit further there are some small cafes and a grocery store with atm right next store overall the staff was very friendly one memeber of management was a bit rude but this was quickly forgotten as everyone else from the receptionist to the cocktail server went above and beyond to assist us the carpets look like they could use a god cleaning but everything else was very nice and very clean it was a fair price for location and offerrings i would stay again
