i stayed in the executive suite and the view was breath taking staff was so friendly and helpful facilities were great ice bucket and glasses with mini bar a little space to put your personal items in ice machine on same floor as the room i found the bar and restaurant on the expensive side and decided not to eat there but had a drink again the staff were lovely very clean and modern bar if i visit london again i will look to stay in this hotel again as the location was fantastic
