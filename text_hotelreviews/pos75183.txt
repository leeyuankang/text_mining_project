the area was very convenient and noce not too far from the action we took a cab ride from leister square and paid pounds which we think was not bad the tube station is about a walk and the cw ter of town is about a min walk away and the walk is lovely i enjoyed my stay and would recommend rooms where very comfortable and had enough space new and clean
