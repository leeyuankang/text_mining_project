ive stayed at this hotel a few times now and never had a bad experience the staff are very diligent and extremely helpful the rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and the house keeping is very prompt and quick it has a limited fitness centre but enough to keep you going and give you a good workout id recommend getting a river view room as the views can be quite stunning early in the morning also location couldn t be better and i will stay there again
