can t recommend this place enough and i visit london every month fantastic friendly professional staff impeccable service nice quiet rooms comfortable beds room service was quick and good bar is perfect for a work coffee or an evening cocktail there were lots of nice touches from the call just after arrival to ask if there was anything else the hotel could do or provide to water at turndown to the ziplock bag which appeared in the bathroom the night before checkout the pool is lovely no chlorine and just the right temperature but above all it s the staff one of the best run hotels i ve ever seen
