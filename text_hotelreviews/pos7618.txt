our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff we got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice this was our first time in paris and we loved it farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had would definitely recommend it
