had a one night stay at this hotel and have nothing but praise for this hotel be sure to get superior room that has fantastic view on arc de triomphe and enjoy your morning coffee routine or wine evenings on terrace overall room was clean and cosy and very quiet and comfortable for good night rest hotel staff was very courteous informative and helpful i ll definitely stay here again and make sure it is more then one night
