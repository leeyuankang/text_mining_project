the staff were very polite and helpful the breakfast and food from the restaurant was very good we had a small issue with a leaking toilet and mentioned it at reception no big deal but later that night they sent up a lovely tray of refreshments and chocolates for our trouble it wasn t a hassle but a nice touch from the hotel the location is also fantastic about a minute walk to the tower and right next to the aussie embassy highly recommend this hotel def
