the view of the eiffel tower from our balcony was amazing in fact the pics on the website don t even do it justice the hotel should really post better pics of the view would attract more people i think i m big on spacious balconies and amazing views so i was not disappointed they should definitely advertise better pics of it the beds were comfy shower was big having a bar downstairs was nice we didn t eat at the restaurant but it looked amazing
