this hotel made my first solo trip birthday vacation to paris a very pleasant experience great location less than minutes away from the eiffel tower staff were friendly and professional and they give you free chocolate bars for your birthday the room i stayed in deluxe king suite with a balcony view of the eiffel tower was quiet and comfortable i recommend this hotel for first timers solo trippers and couples looking for a romantic getaway
