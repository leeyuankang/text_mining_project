staff were very smart polite and helpful and most were fluent in english the room and shower room were very clean and tidy the shower room had both a hand held and drench showers we had an excellent view of the eiffel tower from our room on the seventh floor making the hotel ideally located to reach most of the tourist attractions minute walk to eiffel tower breakfast was brilliant massive selection of food and drink would definitely book again
