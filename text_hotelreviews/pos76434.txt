after driving for hours we were looking to getting into our room at the agreed check in time room was not ready for another minutes we were given a free dink in the bar after the third attempt to check in the view was great but you did have to crane your neck slighty to get around the obstrctions floor as a birthday treat i had ordered a bottle of champange to be placed in the room this was charged for in advance euros no bottle in room and none in stock could have told me in advance before arrival we were fortunate with parking parking straight outside the hotel entrance there is a public car park nearby underground and secure and costs euros per day breakfast was a treat overall this is a busy executive hotel the staff are generally friendly and courteous apart from the one who tried to upsell our deluxe double room to the pullman suite at the price would stay here again but would look at others before booking
