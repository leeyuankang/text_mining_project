very helpful staff especially one particular lady who helped us deal with air france who had lost our luggage sadly she could not get them to deliver the bags before we left super close to eiffel tower a minute walk away plus only mins from the metro so all in all a great location served breakfast until which was also good picture was taken from the room balcony
