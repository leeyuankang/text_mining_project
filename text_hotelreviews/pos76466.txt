the property was selected for the view and the view did not disappoint people need to understand that the view is off to the side so most rooms you will need to walk out on to the balcony and look right to see the eiffel tower but you won t be disappointed location was close to convenient rer and metro stations that will take you to all the great sights the room was very comfortable bed was amazing and shower was great room service was quick and the food tasty breakfast is self service and the food was great internet was easy to access and fast for most purposes for the money i was very pleased with the stay overall if i had ridiculous money to spend i would have chosen the park hyatt vendome or the ritz paris but the pullman provides a memorable experience for a reasonable price of course i stayed off season too
