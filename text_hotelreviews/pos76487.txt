apart from the price you cannot fault this hotel for anything but saying that their clientele are the type that would afford such a price the staff were amazing and really did try go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable we had one of the eiffel tower view rooms and words cannot describe how great this room was the view over the field across the road and then through to the tower on the right is exceptional the amenities were great and they offered loads of free movies and tv to watch the breakfast were excellent and offered something for all tastes i really do enjoy a breakfast buffet that also has a chef to cook you a nice fresh omelette and location just steps from the eiffel tower another plus was the wifi was the best we had on our whole trip around europe thank you pullman paris eiffel tower for a great stay
