the staff was really really helpful recommended us where to eat how to travel around paris etc we are travelling in a group of people with many large luggages at first we decided to go the cdg airport by rer cos if we take the taxi we would have to take taxis then it will cost a lot but the staff arranged us a minivan taxi to take us all together it was very convenient
