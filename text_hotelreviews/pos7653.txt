the location was perfect right outside the rer and metro walking distance from the arc de triomphe and the air france shuttle bus the hotel staff found out that we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room throughout the stay they were very helpful helped us print tickets quick to bring up requests like towels pillows and glasses and gave directions and suggestions for tourist to do s in paris the rooms are a bit small but it s an average size for european hotel rooms they also look exactly the same as the pictures advertised on the site overall a great place to stay in paris highly recommend it
