breakfast was amazing anything that you could possibly want was there the omelettes were freshly made to order and delicious we would say that the breakfast is worth any extra money which you may have to pay croissants were lighter than air the pastries were great full english meat cheese cereal fresh fruit crepes it s all there the hotel is in a fabulous location a stones throw to the eiffel tower across the road to the river where you can walk all the way to the notre dame a lovely walk if the weather is on your side plenty of cafes and bars along the way to sample the fabulous wines and coffee the staff were welcoming and friendly from the reception during the day until the bar staff at the end of the night we could have asked for anything we needed and nothing would have been any trouble our room had a balcony with a view to the eiffel tower which we would highly recommend at night when the tower lights up on the hour the view is spectacular and we would go so far as to say priceless room was clean with a large comfy bed best sleep the boyfriend has had in ages and a great bathroom it did not matter what time we left we always returned to a clean and tidy room the hotel was quiet despite such a busy area we cannot praise this hotel highly enough it was awesome
