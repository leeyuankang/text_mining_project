apart from the fact that the hotel was excellent and that we had the most wonderful stay here plus an amazing view of the eiffel tower from our balcony i was delighted with the fact that at booking i was asked if it was a special occasion which it was my sister s birthday i hadn t expected that they would do anything but in fact on arrival they wished my sister a very happy birthday and we received chocolates and free cocktails all staff were incredibly helpful and polite and our room was spacious and comfortable i would certainly return given the chance and would highly recommend it
