the staff in the breakfast room is the best we have ever encountered excellent food and service the staff especially the girls from the breakfast room went out of their way to make our wedding anniversary extra special the surprise waiting for us in our room when we returned after breakfast just blew us away for us there would never be anywhere else in paris that could top this hotel hope to return in the very near future
