wonderful helpful staff and really efficient cleaning service we went down to breakfast at and by when we returned to our room it was spotless i recommend paying that little bit extra for a room with an eiffel tower view because it really made the trip special check in and check out was fast and simple and the staff all spoke perfect english the breakfast was buffet style and offered a lot of choice and it never seemed rushed or crowded an excellent stay
