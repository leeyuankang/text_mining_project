it was very convenient for us as we were attending a wedding at london zoo so it was only a minute walk weather permitting and it was to the venue the room was very clean and the bed very comfortable the buffet breakfast next morning was excellent we checked out the following morning we were still able to leave the car there as we wanted to have a walk to regents park which was across the road staff were all very friendly it is also a convenient place for the cricket at lords as that is only across the road as well
