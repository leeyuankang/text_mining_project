we liked the friendliness of the staff who were also very helpful we left a valuable item in the hotel safe and after a couple hours after we checked out we called the hotel and they searched for our item and found it we stayed at the junior suite and it had plenty of room and was very comfortable for us we found an excellent italian restaurant firebrand that serves wonderful seafood pizza for a very good price the pizza is cooked in a traditional italian oven the hotel is close to the canal which can be used to walk beside to various destinations that are close to the hotel the view from the room was very good as we were on the seventh floor
