brilliant customer service i forgot to take an item of my belonging after leaving so i called reception and asked to locate it in the room where i stayed thank goodness the staff member found it soon after i called and kept it in a safe place for me to retrieve when i went back to collect it can t thank that person enough plus the staff are generally helpful enough to assist with a very good concierge to arrange taxis etc
