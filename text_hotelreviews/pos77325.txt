very nice restaurant and good breakfast normally i prefer breakfast within the price but ok the option to have breakfast and pay on some mornings and not on other mornings gave us the flexibility we needed on this trip the room was not small or cramped the staff was friendly and helpful the bed was high easy to stand up from for people with some mobility issues
