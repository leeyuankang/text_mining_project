hotel was in a great location for me to travel to and from abbey road i was in a single person room on the floor great comfy double bed tea and coffee facilities and everything else you d expect from a good hotel bathroom was a bit small but everything was perfect in it had breakfast on one of the days i was there really great selection and everything tasted fantastic all in all a great trip
