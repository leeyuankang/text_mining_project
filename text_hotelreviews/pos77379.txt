yes the bed was excellent the room restful with no traffic or train noise and with good light excluding curtains it was clean and very well equipped with a bathtub wardrobe with enough hangers we appreciated the steel water heater for coffee and tea packets of cookies and the small fridge the lift wait was usually not long and the ride was very fast the fitness room was a pleasure to use the concierge sent someone quickly with a generous supply when we needed more milk and towels
