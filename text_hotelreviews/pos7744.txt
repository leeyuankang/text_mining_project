location surpassed expectations very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful large window to open almost like a patio which overlooked the cool old neighborhood wonderful breeze as i laid in bed no screen but no bugs i think we had a tiny glimpse of the eiffel tower from the window the tiny elevator was actually really fun for my daughter the tub was great the staff were incredibly nice they even helped me to my uber which wasn t necessary and made sure he was taking me to the right place the proximity to the wonderful luxembourg gardens was heavenly
