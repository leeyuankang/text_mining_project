the location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help the breakfast had more items than i expected for example i don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea to my surprise they had both regular yogurt and greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the eiffel tower that was a totally unexpected treat although i also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small it could barely fit person i don t know how the bellman got our suitcases and rolling carryons into it i imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor
