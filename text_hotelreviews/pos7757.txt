fantastic hotel near the sorbonne on the paris left bank close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone our room was a decent size and very comfortable the hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated our room faced the street but at night it was quiet there are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff
