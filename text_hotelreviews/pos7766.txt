very good location safe and quiet in latin quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and rer directly to the airport and late afternoon i can always have a recess at the bueatiful luxembourg park around the corner plenty of nice and affordable local and asian restaurants i like especially au p re louis and sushiyaki i stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day this area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service my room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day i saw sunset on effel tower and it was amazing
