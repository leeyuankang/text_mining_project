every thing was wonderful the only aspect i would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup the beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central paris the breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order there was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas the reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations
