we loved that it was located in a nice quiet neighborhood not in a touristy location so close to public transportation and walking places the staff was always available and friendly breakfast was tasty and the hostess was so sweet she remembered exactly how we liked our coffee although the rooms are small ours was perfect we will request a room higher up and with a balcony next time there wasn t one available on this trip
