the staff was extremely nice and helpful the breakfast was very good and the rooms were clean they helped us to make dinner reservations and called cabs for us when necessary the room we were in had several nice balconies which we were able to sit at and have a drink after a day of sight seeing the rooms were extremely sound proof we could not hear street noise or the neighbors which is unusual in paris where the street noise can often be unbearable at night
