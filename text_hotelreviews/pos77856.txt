the entire staff was lovely and so helpful on funding fun things to do the barista jeremy was amazing he befriended us and made us feel really welcome the area is quiet which was nice at night but one block away there are streets and streets of bars and restaurants frequented by locals amazing experience all around we went as a group of friends but it s definitely a place i ll go back to again and again
