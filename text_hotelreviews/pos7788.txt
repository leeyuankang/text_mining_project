me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel the location is only minutes walking from luxembourg rer station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g palais du luxembourg and odeon theatre the room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable the best thing about the room was the view we asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the floor with stunning view of eiffel tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good indonesian restaurant named indonesia really worth a try please google the location for details
