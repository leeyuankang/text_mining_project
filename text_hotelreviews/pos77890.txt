i managed to book this hotel at the last minute having been told at the hotel westminster that our original booking had been cancelled by them with no explanation and no vacancies either thank you westminster as the hotel bachaumant was fantastic the staff were brilliant we had a good sized air conditioned room and the location was perfect for visiting all parts of paris during the day and for the local nightlife during the evening soooo much better than the snooty westminster and we will definitely visit again
