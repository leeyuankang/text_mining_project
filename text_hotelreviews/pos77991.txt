ok so i will have to say the front desk staff is excellent especially the early morning shift dude i have to admit i would think he probably has heard it all but still put up with us tourist great guy and you can see he really tries i just would love to hear what he says about us all when he goes home and has a few glasses of wine but great guy and good staff the rooms are just like the photos and clean and very nice the locations is in the heart of the city and you could not ask for a better location if the heart is what you want
