very relaxed quiet boutique style hotel staff were friendly and very helpful the location is terrific few minutes walk to the champs elysees and about mins to the eiffel tower which we could view from our room there are plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel pierre jean paul being one that serves exceptionally high quality food but at a price to chez andre across the road that is a bit less formal but decent all the same
