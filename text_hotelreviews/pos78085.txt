the beds and pillows were fantastic but the all the staff really made it for us in particular we loved the night manager at the desk he was informed and friendly we had two rooms off a private corridor which was great for a sisters trip the breakfast was great with sufficient range to choose something different each day the croissants were below average but the bread and all else were spot on
