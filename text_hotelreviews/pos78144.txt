the hotel was located in a very central spot with easy walking access to many of the main attractions there is a shuttle bus just around the corner to cdg airport for a very minimal rate of euro per person around the hotel you have many restaurants and lovely streets to walk over and above this the second best thing we liked was the friendly and helpful staff at the hotel who assisted us rite through out our stay
