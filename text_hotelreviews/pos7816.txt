the location is really the best there are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well you re a minute walk away from the notre dame as well our room was lovely comfy beds and enough space for girls with way more luggage than necessary we also had a view of the eiffel tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window perfect
