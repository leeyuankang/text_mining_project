the location is wonderful if you like to spend time in the latin quarter which i do great restaurants in the area close to notre dame cathedral plenty of rer metro stops in case you don t want to walk or would like to get over to the eiffel tower or champs elysee i am on my first around the globe trip which means i ve been on the road for while so the laundromat right on the next block also gave me the opportunity to run a load of laundry for euros rather than the ridiculous fee a hotel would charge
