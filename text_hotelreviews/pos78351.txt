the hotel is quite wonderful only twelve rooms so the experience with the staff was quite special this is a luxury hotel and feels like it every step of the way perfect for special occasions the staff went way out of their way in every instance i cannot say enough about them also it is in arguably the safest neighborhood in paris given that the president s residence is right around the corner it is a short walk to the champs elysee place de la concorde and the sights of paris
