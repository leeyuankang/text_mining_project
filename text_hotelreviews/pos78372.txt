very cool hotel lovely garden out the back for breakfast and drinks peaceful and quiet inside despite being on a very busy road position fantastic for earls court tube and we could walk to kensington gardens many inexpensive restaurants nearby happy to store our luggage we left cases for a week while on a quick trip to scandinavia then returned to the hotel for more nights would definitely recommend the rockwell to friends
