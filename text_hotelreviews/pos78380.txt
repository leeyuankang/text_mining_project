excellent location ideal place for lovers to go on foot it takes just minutes to get to the beautiful kensington garden and then have a walk to the center by magnificant parks easy way to get to heathrow by metro perfect staff small size room appeared to be more cozy than expected due to comfortable furnuture arrangement but please be aware if you are big size person you might face some small inconvenience expecially in the tiny bathroom for me it was very nice stay and i recommend this hotel
