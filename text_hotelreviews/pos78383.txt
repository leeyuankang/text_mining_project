the stay overall was great the room wasn t ready in time but we were upgraded to a suite as compensation even though we did not complain about it at one point during the stay my ipad stopped working and i urgently needed a computer there were none available other than the ones at front desk and i was permitted to use one of them the staff were nice and it is great value for money highly recommended
