great staff very friendly and accommodating always there to greet you conveniently located close to two different underground stations walking distance to several museums very quiet and charming smaller hotel with all of the perks and amenities without the chaos of a large hotel had a room facing a very busy street without any noise incredible buffet breakfast was included it was simple overall but very satisfying
