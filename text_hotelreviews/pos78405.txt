we chose this hotel mainly because the location was amazing it is on the western edge of zone but this hotel is very near to harrods and the knightsbridge sloan street shopping area the v a museum the natural history museum definitely recommended and royal albert hall it is also only a short minute walk to earl s court station which is a short direct tube journey to the west end piccadilly circus and leceister square breakfast was good they had a reasonable spread of food of a good standard room size was a plus it was very large and we needed the space as we had a lot of luggage for an event staff were friendly and helpful allowed us to grab some bread and pastries to go as we were late one morning
