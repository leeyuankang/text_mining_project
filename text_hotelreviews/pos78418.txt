the staff were friendly and extremely helpful for a small hotel there were always plenty of people around to provide help and service the room was larger than normal for london huge comfortable bed and armchairs for chilling out breakfast was limited buffet in small dining room but all fresh and staff would try to meet special requests not always successfully and were unswervingly charming and friendly even with harder to please guests
