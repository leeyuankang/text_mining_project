great to be located so close to both st michel and odeon stations also short distance to luxembourg gardens the staff at reception were really personable and helpful kids and yrs old appreciated and enjoyed the chocolates at reception had breakfast once at the hotel and it was great found the hotel to be homely yet efficient was good to get a triple room too which was really comfortable and not that easy to find
