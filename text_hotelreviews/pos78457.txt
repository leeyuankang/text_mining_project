the hotel is just a walk to earls court tube station and a walk to the v a museum or buses pass the door the staff are very helpful and pleasant the single rooms are smallish but with high ceilings the ambience is better than many i have stayed before my friend became ill and the staff were genuinely caring about his condition offering him a cup of ginger tea didn t have to do it but nice personal touches breakfast is very good with choice of continental and cooked i was in room overlooking the back courtyard where in summer you can sit outside and bbq
