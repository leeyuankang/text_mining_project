i liked everything about my stay at the rockwell i came to london to sit exams and from the beginning everyone made me feel at home the room was clean with all the required facilities despite being a bit small although i understand that this is standard for london it was cleaned and tidied on daily basis the staff were super friendly helpful and went out of their way to provide any assistance needed a special thank you to the ladies at the reception and ola for crossing her fingers for me the food at the hotel was also good with a good variety for breakfast and a variety of options for dinner the hotel is located very close to earl s court tube station with access to the piccadilly and district lines so it s a direct ride from the airport it is located in a nice safe area close to the museums and everything else overall i was very pleased with my stay and will definitely stay there again
