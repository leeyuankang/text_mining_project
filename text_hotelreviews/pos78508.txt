perfect location close to train hyde park excellent shopping and restaurants all attractions and heathrow easily reachable by train but the hotel is in a pleasant residential non touristy area decor is stylish but cozy avoiding both the generic chain hotel vibe and the super trendy ultra modern look it s not a huge room but is very comfortable with small lounge area including couch and desk spacious bathroom and bed on mezzanine floor upstairs quality furnishings throughout no street noise at all even though it s on a main road amazing value for money
