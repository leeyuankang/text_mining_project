we had double deluxe rooms which were very comfortable and not small which is a big bonus for a hotel in london staff were really nice there were tea making facilities in the room which is always a nice to have toiletries were also good decor was lovely and there were a lot of extra touches which give a luxury feel such as new elle decor and esquire magazines in the room and lavender sleep spray for the bed i would return to this hotel
