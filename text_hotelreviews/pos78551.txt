the rockwell is a terrific place to stay in london everything about this boutique hotel i found appealing the staff were very friendly and efficient nothing was too much trouble for them my room was comfortable nicely decorated and extremely clean the hotel is well situated and the bus which is on the doorstep takes you to south kensington knightsbridge and oxford st the tube is just around the corner i also enjoyed my dining experience there breakfasts were excellent i will return to the rockwell and can highly recommend this hotel to other travellers
