my room was very clean the bed very comfortable the size of the room was perfect for a solo traveler i think it may be a room intended for only one as there was only one bathrobe in the closet it it were a room for two i could see that it might be a tad too small room at the back of the hotel location was easy to get to from the earl s court underground station only a minute commute from heathrow the little neighborhood that i had to walk through was very sweet i ate at the king s head which was excellent as well as the indian food restaurant masala which was more casual i also ate at the secret thai restaurant which had a charming atmosphere and great food location of the hotel was a minute walk to the natural museum and the victoria and albert museum i am a walker so it didn t bother me but the buckingham palace is miles from the hotel easy to find and very safe but it is a walk
