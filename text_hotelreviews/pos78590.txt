my first impression was this is very upmarket hotel very contemporary and chic boutique paradise in the centre of london excellent spacious room with all the comforts one expects the staff were fabulous and made sure my stay was very enjoyable the breakfast was delicious and i could have had a scottish breakfast for a small supplement i will definitely be back to stay loved it
