this hotel was so cute and perfect for me for my night stay in london very close to earl s court tube station a relatively quiet one at that and nearby restaurants and grocery stores had an excellent dinner at the king s head nearby great vibe and great food the staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful i loved every amenity would definitely stay here again
