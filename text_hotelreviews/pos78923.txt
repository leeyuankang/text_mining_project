the hotel is gorgeous it is in a former school building and the designers of the hotel have scrupulously maintained the character of the original building while transforming it into a top notch hotel you cannot ask for a better location close to transit and tower bridge plenty of dining options close by staff are professional and pleasant our room was spacious and comfortable
