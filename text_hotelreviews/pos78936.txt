my wife and i were staying as we had a wedding to attend nearby the property was a stones throw from tower bridge the hotel building was stunning to look at and the interiors extremely high quality and well executed the bed was really comfy and the bathroom was really nice it had ones of those hi tech japanese toilets which was an experience we loved it
