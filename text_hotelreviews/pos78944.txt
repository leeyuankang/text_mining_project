absolutely stunning property in a very attractive location i was celebrating the birthday of my girlfriend and the staff really made our stay a memorable one we got upgraded to one the suites which was beautifully decorated with a great personal touch i have stayed at several star hotels in london but must say that this hotel is my personal favourite so far the staff who were very friendly and helpful looked after us during the entire stay the bar is amazing serving indian and nepali beers you won t usually try elsewhere most unique about this hotel is the building itself previously a school building the rooms and restaurant are very unique with high ceilings and chic design really enjoyed our stay and i would recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience indian hospitality at its finest
