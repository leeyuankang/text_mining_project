the overwhelming friendliness and thoughtfulness of the staff there were so many instances of helpfulness from the staff that i cant list them all i loved all the extras in the bedroom though i felt that a heated toilet seat in the bathroom was a trifle over the top the dinner was immaculately cooked and presented and was wonderfully tasty i was their first guest and wish the hotel a fine future
