the room was extremely good we were a couple together and we agreed that the room was big the bed lovely the bathroom large clean and tidy you get so much for the money here we were in room number down the floor of course the view was not that big but i did not care i asked for a room as close to the ground as possible and i got it such a good service and the metro is almost next door restaurants nearby and also if you want a drink in the evening i did not try the breakfast but it looked very good as far i could see
