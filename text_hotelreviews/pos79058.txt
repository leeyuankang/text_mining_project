not worth the money the shower glass was broken i smashed into it twice the hotel didnt fix it and transfer me to another room no towels in the room always need to ask for them staff at the breakfast are cold as ice and forget what you order and when they do it takes ages more guests were complaining about it if location is not an issue i would not recommend this hotel
