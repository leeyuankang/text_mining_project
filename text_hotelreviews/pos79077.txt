the breakfast was very good and the staff very efficient although there was a good self service buffet we also ordered several items from the menu which were brought out to us without having to prompt anyone nothing seemed too much trouble the location of the hotel couldn t have been better great little restaurants nearby oxford street shopping on the doorstep and theatre land a stones throw away should have been the perfect stay
