the location was fantastic right by liberty s opposite carnaby street it s a very short walk to oxford street or regent street and only few minutes walk from oxford circus tube station the bedroom was bigger than i ve had in other star hotels at times the price also to find a hotel with a pool in central london is unusual and we thoroughly enjoyed our time spent in it the staff were all very friendly and helpful during our stay and we were very well looked after
