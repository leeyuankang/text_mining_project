the reception staff were really welcoming friendly and professional the location of this hotel right near oxford circus station couldn t have been better i wish i lived there the room was very clean and the bathroom was nicely refurbished i had a quiet night s sleep which was amazing for central london i didn t eat there so cannot comment on the restaurant facilities
