the courthouse is a nice hotel but lacks the luxury expected form a star hotel breakfast is nice and so is the location which is amazing rooftop terrace is also lovely but invites many walk in guests which are not supervised or vetted once inside so make sure you lock up your room overall price is high for what you get perhaps think twice before you book many other alternatives exist around the soho
