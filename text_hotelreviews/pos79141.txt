the location of this hotel is amazing just at the top of the pedestrian shopping area around the corner from the oxford circus underground stop very lively shopping restaurants and crowds to be found in the evening all around the hotel but the hotel itself was super quiet and comfortable we didn t make use of the facilities other than the room because the weather was so good during our stay and we wandered all around london did use room service one night for a later night snack and the food was quite good
