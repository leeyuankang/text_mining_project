expensive hotel no iron in the room paid for breakfast on the booking on arrival they tried to fleece me of a refundable deposit incase of mini bar usage apparently and then a further for of us for the mediocre breakfast most of which was cold before paying for breakfast they said it would be as we had rooms but a single person in one of the rooms tried it on at every opportunity need a lot of wedge to stay there quite frankly they are not the best hotel in london to charge that amount
