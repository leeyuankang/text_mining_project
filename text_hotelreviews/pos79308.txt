the location was great a few minutes walk from oxford circus tube an m s nearby as well as the berwick st market for street food one of our party is vegan and we found all sorts of places nearby serving vegan food a real bonus shopping on the doorstep liberty across the street a real social vibe in the area and you can walk along regent st to arrive at piccadilly circus and onto leicester square convenient to theatres too the palladium is around the corner from the hotel we would definitely use the hotel again when staying in london
