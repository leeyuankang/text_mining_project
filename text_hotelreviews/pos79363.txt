the actual building is beautiful i like that they have kept the floors and many of the original features the holding cells in the bar are a great feature staff in the bar were excellent and the drinks although london prices were not overpriced the reception staff were pleasant and helpful our room was spacious and clean and although we were in central london it was very quiet
