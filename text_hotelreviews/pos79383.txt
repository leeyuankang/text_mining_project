the location was perfect for our two day stay in london we were able to use the hotel as our base and walk everywhere we wanted the concierge recommendations and directional help were spot on and we were able to store our luggage after check out for an extended afternoon while the room decor was a bit dated the bathroom and overall cleanliness of the room was fine
