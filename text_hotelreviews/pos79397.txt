i loved the quirkiness of the hotel for example the bar area keeping the cells as a feature and decorating them and the fact there is a cinema there i d definitely like to try that next time i stay the overall look of the hotel corridors and public areas was lovely and bright and comfortable the staff at concierge tarik especially were very helpful in helping us chose a restaurant to eat in but we ended up dining in the silk restaurant on site which was amazing food and good sercice highly recommend the rooftop bar was cool and the cocktails were delicious too the blankets to keep warm were a nice touch
