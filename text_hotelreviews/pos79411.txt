the location of this hotel is perfect for shopping theater or eating and drinking the staff were all extremely polite and friendly and made us feel very welcome we asked for an early check in and this was made possible for us and on check out we were allowed to leave our bags in the hotel while we continued to have a shop around town would highly recommend staying in this hotel and we certainly will be back
