the location was perfect for us we had booked tickets for the palladium and it was literally next door to the courthouse and also a stones throw away from carnaby street soho etc the roof terrace bar was also a lovely surprise and we were lucky enough to enjoy the sunshine up there on our arrival also loved the history of the building and the way it had been preserved in some areas of the hotel
