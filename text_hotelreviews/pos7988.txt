not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on park lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special upon arrival i mentioned that it was our wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele i was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like vip s you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again
