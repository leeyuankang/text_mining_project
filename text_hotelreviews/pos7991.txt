i m very pleased that we choose to stay at intercontinental london park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment i already rated the property but what i really wanted to mention here is the concierge micheal petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc we felt so spoiled this time thanks to them i totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our hotels in the gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an english breakfast like any other hotel we are totally booking in it again
