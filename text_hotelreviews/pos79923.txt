we stayed here for three days for a festival in town the staff were really nice and helpful and the breakfast was kept hot and replenished regularly for the duration of their breakfast hours the room itself was nice they clean regularly unless you tell them not to and there was a big comfy bed that my friend and i had no problem sharing
