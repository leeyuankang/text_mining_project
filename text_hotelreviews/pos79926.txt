the hotel was very conveniently situated at a comparatively reasonable price the room was quiet and clean and the staff polite and friendly i only needed a brief overnight stay for a business meeting the next day but took the opportunity to meet with family during the previous evening so i just needed a basic but safe and clean overnight stay near to transport links
