the room we were given for persons was far too small in my opinion it was really for person bed side table on only side of bed and difficult to get out of bed for person unless you climbed over the bed disturbing the other person in addition on check in at there was dirty bed linen piled up in stairwell causing health safety issues happened on checking out aswell not good to block stairwells or to touch other people s dirty linen ugh
