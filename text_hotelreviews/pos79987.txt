noisy neighbours and smoking next to my window in the night the hotel staff were helpful and found me a different room at as i couldn t sleep but there is no bell on reception to call staff and night staff took quite a while to arrive at reception from where you just have to stand around and hope someone will turn up good sized shower and nice to have a real wardrobe and security box
