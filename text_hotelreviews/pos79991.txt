for this money we couldn t have asked for a better stay we got a great discount and ended up paying around gbp per night for a double bed which is a steal for such a central location the room was small but had everything we needed and more including a safe the bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch the location was perfect earl s court tube station is around the corner and from there you can reach any part of the central london in minutes
