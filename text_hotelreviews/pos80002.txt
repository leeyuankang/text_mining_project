the rooms are tiny but have everything you could need for a short stay the bed is extremely comfortable i felt like i was sleeping on a combination of clouds and marshmallows and the tv is attached to a bracket on the wall that swivels out for comfortable viewing whilst in bed the shower pressure is amazing and the bathroom is fairly roomy when taking into consideration the tiny room size the breakfast room is also quite small but again covers everything you would need both continental and full english available a variety of bread and condiments along with a variety of herbal teas staff are also very helpful and friendly wifi is freely available and fairly good speed and the location is incredible min walk to earl s court station with byron s on the way
