stayed one night as a girlie treat with my mum and despite being given the wrong room to begin with we were given a double rather than the twin specified at booking veronica was delightfully helpful and apologetic and our actual room was perfect spacious well appointed and clean as well as being ideally located for earl s court underground and walking to chelsea kensington would definitely stay again
