the hotel is small with a real nice feel of a victorian house to it it s in an old victorian building the rooms were renovated and are modernly designed the whole street is a row of victorian houses with a few hotels in the adjacent buildings the staff were extremely nice and very helpful it feels like they really care that you have a good experience there are small things you get for free like water bottles and cookies in the room the rooms are small but well arranged and were perfect for us breakfast was a full english type breakfast with lots of selection we ended up eating too much location is great it is about min walk to the earls court tube station from which you can easily get to any of the interesting places in london there are a few restaurants and bars up the street which was also great for getting a bite or a drink and a supermarket at the closest street corner getting there from heathrow is just one min underground trip from heathrow or about a min cab ride from there we are definitely coming back if they have vacancy the next time around
