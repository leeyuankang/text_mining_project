i liked the location of the hotel it was on the piccadilly line convenient for lhr and eurostar i enjoyed staying in the earls court neighborhood the hotel was on a quiet street and the tube and buses were just a block away the tv line up was so good i sometimes found it hard to break away from it and leave my room
