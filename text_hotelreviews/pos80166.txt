the location the hotel is only min walk to earl s court station there are many bars restaurants and convenient stores nearby although i requested for upper story room the receptionist recommended the ground floor room for us it was a good recommendation as it would be quite troublesome for us to use a small lift with our big luggage room is clean and big enough for people
