unfortunately i arrived quite late and had an appointment the following morning so i did not get chance to eat breakfast so i can not comment on that the bed was very comfy and the a c was particularly welcome due to the heatwave the room had everything i needed the gentleman on the desk when i checked in was particularly helpful also the following morning when he had already printed directions for me i thought that was fab so thank you to him sorry i didn t get his name i hope to stay again and and spend a little more time in the room and the restaurant next time
