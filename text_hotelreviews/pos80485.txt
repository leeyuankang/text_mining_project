the location was perfect close to marble arch underground buses or walking distance to all the major attractions a big old building so the room was really quiet and the bed and bedding was super comfortable the staff were excellent and very helpful in every way and the buffet breakfast was truly on point a variety of everything for all tastes and the chicken sausages were awesome i had a pair of extremely muddy boots from being at a festival and the hotel gave them a complimentary clean and shine i travel extensively and was really impressed with service of this place
