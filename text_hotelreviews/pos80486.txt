lovely helpful staff very quiet location but also convenient for oxford street etc had a really good nights sleep the choice at breakfast was excellent but no pre warmed plates available for hot food which as a result went cold very quickly scrambled egg too sloppy for my personal taste but you can t please all of the people all of the time will be staying again
