an absolutely incredible boutique hotel offering so much value for money at the top end of the hotel market you could pay times more for a room at one of the more established hotel chains in paris and yes you d have a bigger lobby and some extra facilities you d never use but at le narcisse they ve really focussed on the things that matter excellent service beautifully designed rooms a top end spa and they ve invested in really high quality fixtures and fittings to top it all the restaurant provides exquisite fine dining without a silly price tag to go with it and again the service was faultless whoever runs this place should be proud i ll be back
