decided on this hotel after reading such lovely reviews was not disappointed from the moment you arrive the staff are attentive and warm the room was absolutely beautiful high ceilings but a modern and boutique feel the area itself is in walking distance of eiffel towe and not far from the very fashionable st germain the spa facilities were charming too in short thoroughly recommend this hotel and would stay there in a heartbeat
