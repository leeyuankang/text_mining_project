we visited this hotel whilst visiting london for a birthday we arrived in plenty of time and were able to check in early approx as the room was ready the staff were pleasant enough and showed us the room the rooms are clean and the bathroom was good the next day they were kind enough to let me leave my car in the car park whilst we went into the city
