staff were very helpful and friendly looked after our bags before check in and after check out so we could do some sightseeing when booking i mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday they sent up a card and some chocolates as a treat very nice thought hotel was positioned well for visiting theatreland and for visiting the london eye and tower of london areas across the road from the tube station was convenient
