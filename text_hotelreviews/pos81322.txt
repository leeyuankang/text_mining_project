i had told the hotel it was my husbands birthday and to our pleasant surprise they had gone above and beyond the call of duty with balloons and a fabulous dessert complete with a chocolate happy birthday message the room was perfect and the breakfast was delicious i particularly liked my omelette made from scratch thank you so much for a wonderful stay
