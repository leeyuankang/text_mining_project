the general location of the hotel together with being so close to blackfriars tube station meant that we were central to or had really easy access all the main tourist attractions perfect for everything bar perhaps main line shopping ie the big department stores which pleased my husband the executive club room with lounge access was certainly worth the extra cost offering a delicious breakfast and a good range of evening drinks and pickies in pleasant surroundings before going out for the evening whilst being looked after by very pleasant and helpful staff definitely will return
