this gorgeous little hotel is situated right next to the pantheon but feels like a quiet respite from the busy streets of paris from the moment you step in the door you can tell that much care has been taken in decorating and furnishing this hotel there are so many lovely touches throughout the common areas and the guest rooms from the beamed ceilings to the rotary phones and other decor our rooms were beautiful and charming the bathrooms are very modern super clean and comfortable the bed was wonderful and we appreciated the air conditioning breakfast served in the stone walled cellar was delightful truly the best scrambled eggs i have ever had the hotel backs up to a quiet neighborhood with a number of restaurants cafes and patisseries that we really enjoyed last but not least the staff at reception and throughout the hotel were so gracious and friendly we look forward to returning to the hotel les dames du pantheon
