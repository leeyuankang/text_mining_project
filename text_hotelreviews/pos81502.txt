the rooms were beautifully decorated and comfortable lovely and warm which was important as we were visiting in february breakfast was delicious a choice of hot food buttery croissant fruit and baguette to mention just a few of the goodies on offer the staff were delightful and very attentive but discreet location was good and the general area is full of interesting places to discover
