we enjoyed our stay at this boutique hotel despite overlooking that i only booked one room for our family of four only double occupancy the staff were kind enough to accommodate us with a second room we picked the hote not only for it s location but also for the theme of famous females of france it is conveniently located in the latin quarter and within walking distance of the luxembourg gardens we had to leave the next morning but we plan to come back for another stay
