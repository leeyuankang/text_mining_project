excellent reception staff they were very helpful i stayed for nights at this hotel following a london paris cycle tour the hotel doesn t have a bicycle rack however they stored my bicycle on their garage basement they took very good care of my bike i was very grateful for this the location is fantastic few minutes walking from eiffel tower it is also very clean and the price was great
