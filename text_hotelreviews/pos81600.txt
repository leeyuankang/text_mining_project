this friendly hotel was located in a convenient location close to latin quarter metro and buses classic room was small but comfortable the hotel provided afternoon tea in the foyer which was a bonus and filtered water was available the staff offered helpful advice and useful suggestions nothing seemed too much trouble this was my second visit
