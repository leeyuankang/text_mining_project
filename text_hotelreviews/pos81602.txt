what a beautiful little hotel we stayed in a superior room which was whilst a little small very well appointed and tastefully decorated much like the rest of the hotel as a booking com genius member breakfast was included in the room price and was served in a lovely converted wine cellar downstairs all the staff were very helpful and friendly however i must mention one in particular clotilde who was extremely helpful and more than willing to go above and beyond very highly recommended
