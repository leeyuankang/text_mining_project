the service was top notch we didn t speak the language so getting around was a concern of ours but the staff made it extremely easy their recommendations for food should not be missed because they never fail to impress the bed was warm and comfortable with pillows like clouds the tea time in the lobby was a nice way to rewind after a long day and before dinner i have been all over europe a dozen times and this is my favorite hotel so far
