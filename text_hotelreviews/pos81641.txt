love everything about this hotel fabulous room super comfortable massive bed everywhere clean fresh soft towels the area feels safe good selection of bars and restaurants close to metro short walk to pantheon and notre dam staff are friendly welcoming and helpful during our stay it was my birthday and on retiring to our room i found a bowl of fruit nuts and cakes and a message from the staff i was so pleased we used the hotel shuttle to travel to the airport and the driver came back to the airport to pick us up after we spent minutes getting through border control couldn t fault it will return to this hotel every time in paris b
