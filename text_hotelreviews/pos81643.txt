we really liked following things location it is very close to metro and very close to many places to see in fact we walked to all places we wanted to see except monmartre where we took metro it is also not on very noisy and crowded street for us it was very important as some streets in central part of paris are so crowded and noisy that it is not pleasant for stay surrounding was also clean and more tidy than some other places in paris breakfast was very nice it was much better than in many hotels i have seen many different options for food they had afternoon tea with sweets which was also very nice experience it has steam bath hamam and a small gym we have not used gym but we used hamam couple of times it was great after long walks in the city it was wonderful to get soaked and relax in the evening you just need to book in advance with the reception it is free bathroom was very nicely equipped if you could have forgotten anything everything was provided
