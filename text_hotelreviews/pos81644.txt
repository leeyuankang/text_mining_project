room great no view but not in room long water in fridge every day was a nice touch breakfast was lovely and the afternoon tea a treat staff very friendly and helpful the airport shuttle as cheaper than a regular taxi lovely location with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby handy for the metro to travel around paris would definitely stay here again
