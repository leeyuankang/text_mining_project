a wonderful gem of a hotel in the perfect location for us staff was friendly and ever so helpful room was very generous by parisan standards and very up to date in all ways chic but with all the american appointments fridge hairdryer free wifi was worried at first that it was too far from the heart of the latin district but it turned out to be even better it s a block from the pantheon and a couple blocks from luxembourg gardens a minute walk down st michel to the flurry of the latin district but no noise at night to contend with we used the open tour hop on hop off bus recommended by the staff stop at lux gardens to get further away for some touristy stuff and just to enjoy the other arrondisemonts sp used rer to get from the airport and back euro pp and the lux garden stop was so close while we didn t partake of the euro pp breakfast it was an rather impressive spread far beyond a continental breakfast they were very gracious and comped me a cup of coffee on mornings when that s all i needed highly recommend this hotel and at euro for nights it would be hard to beat
