the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly they were so helpful when we had travel and pick pocketing problems although a small hotel it really gave an intimate and boutique feel the decor was lovely the room wasn t a bad size for a city hotel breakfast was continental type with nice little bar for a g t too i would return again
