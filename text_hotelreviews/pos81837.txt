great location staff was always friendly and helpful room was very clean and comfortable with great working ac plenty of hot water in the shower mini fridge came stocked but also had a bit of extra room for our own food choices the instant coffee in the room was surprisingly tasty not bitter like the instant i get in usa hotels the receptionist got us a taxi to the airport with little notice their driver arrived early and it was significantly cheaper than the one we got at the airport upon arrival overall we had a very pleasant stay
