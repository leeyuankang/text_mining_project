the hotel was extremely clean and well presented the staff were excellent my only dissapontment was the size of the room from the pictures on the web they look a lot roomier however after days we were able to be moved to a lovely suite on the floor which was perfect we had a lovely view of the louvre and the church next door which was excellent this suite also had a coffee machine a very big thank you to all the staff
