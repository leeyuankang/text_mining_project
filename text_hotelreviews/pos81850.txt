the staff were fantastic and so helpful in helping us navigate paris for our first visit the hotel itself was charming in a wonderful location we would definitely stay in this hotel again and will recommend it to others the room was not modern in decoration but this added to the charm of the hotel i wouldn t change anything we were in the attic top floor space and it felt like a little apartment up there
