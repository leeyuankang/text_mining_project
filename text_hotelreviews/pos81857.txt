the staff was fantastic what a difference that makes as well especially in a small hotel they arranged for me to have my hair cut the recommendation was great their restaurant reccomendations were great they were happy and not too busy to chat and very friendly i had separate night stays in different rooms both were clean neat and comfortable i was also able to store my luggage in between my stays enabling me to pack one smaller bag what an enormous kindness and convenience the rooms offer small conveniences like wine snacks and coffee which are a delight there is even a small refrigerator i did not use room service the proximity to popular sites is great you can walk across pont neuf onto the ile de la cit and the metros are very near also near the rer making transfer from the airport a breeze
