the only good thing worth mentioning or praising at pullman paris was the gentleman at the information desk named nima he is an amazing individual excellent in dealing with requests and has answers to almost everything he helped us in everything during our stay we would have struggled big time if he was not there a big thank you sir for making our stay really good otherwise we would be regretting for paying so much just to stay in one okay sized room the facility is modern style so the room and bed was good the bathroom however needs some attention as the shower was broken and door lock did not work view from the room was good location is really good you can walk around and there are so many options for shopping food etc family friendly place
