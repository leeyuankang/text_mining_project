we loved the pullman friendly staff great location that s safe and great restraints near eiffel tower and the bed was amazingly comfortable the only down fall was that the bathroom wasn t the newest but good and would of loved a pool as it was hot and no beach near but was a very pleasant stay close to train buses hop on hop off i would defiantly come back and recommend to anyone coming to paris
