had booked classic double room which is really really small and not worth the price that we paid euro roughly for nights we had to move to superior bedroom at our own cost euro extra per night the bed is comfortable modern and facilities in the room is excellent the hotel is centrally located with easy access to metro i would again request the hotel management staff to put realistic picture of classic double room and please please inform the guests well ahead about any renovation work that is going on in your hotel this would atleast set the expectation we were really disappinted when we entered our room and had to immediately pay for an upgrade
