we travelled throughout europe by car starting in madrid and ending in paris we stayed in many hotels and our stay in paris was probably the best the staff was outstanding helpful courteous and went our of their way to help us enjoy our stay i am not one to write many reviews but i just had to take time to commend the staff at this hotel there was a lot of construction going on at the time but this did not interrupt our enjoyment of paris i highly recommend this facility
