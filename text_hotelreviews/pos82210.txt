we have stayed at the ducs de bourgogne before and booked again because we had enjoyed our previous stay when we arrived this time we found refurbishment work in progress and we were upgraded to the maison albar hotel next door but one it was my sixtieth birthday and i was with my wife son and daughter in law the hotel is fabulous the staff very friendly and we had a wonderful long weekend i don t think you could have a better location to stay with so much in walking distance
