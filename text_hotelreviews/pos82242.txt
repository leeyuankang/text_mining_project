the staff were all very professional and helpful when we arrived they gave us advice on bus tours etc this wasn t a hard sell it was just to be helpful to us when we were struggling with tickets for a show the receptionist offered to print them for us above and beyond i reckon also because it was a special occasion they delivered a bottle of champagne to our room unexpected and very much appreciated
