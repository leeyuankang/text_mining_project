this was our stay and the staff are the best extremely helpful and friendly we didn t realize they were undergoing a renovation so it was slightly inconvenient when the elevator was not in service but management offered a discount for our next trip they are reducing the number of rooms soundproofing and increasing the square footage excellent location in the arrondesment very near notre dame the louve and pont neuf
