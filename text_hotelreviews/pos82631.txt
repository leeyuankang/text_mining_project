the location in kensington is excellent this is a traditional british hotel in decor atmosphere and some quirkiness great to have bar next door with the history of the rolling stones album launch room was a generous size for london the penhalion toiletries were my favourite and a decent hairdryer overally a lovely room in a lovely hotel and good value for money
