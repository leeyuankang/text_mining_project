i loved everything about this hotel the location is perfect for family with small children you have all the museums on the same block kensington grounds is less than walk you can spend a whole day at kensington park beautiful walks the children can feed the ducks look around the kensington gardens for free and have lunch at the cafe we discovered the princess diana memorial park which is just perfect for babies toddlers and children it s not your average park btw there s loads for kids to do so the gore is a perfect hotel for getting to these places without having to tube the hotel is very clean and decor is beautiful if you like that period type of interior the staff are super friendly and attentive to your needs we stayed on the floor we had our baby and a pram and the lift although small it was good enough for getting us up and down we checked out at but was happy that we were able to have our bags stored downstairs whilst we checked out the natural museum and science museum before heading home thomas was super kind to let us leave our bags at the hotel storage room breakfast and dinner here is a must the food taste deliciously amazing will def be staying here in future
