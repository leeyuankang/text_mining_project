picked this hotel because of the location and it was excellent with lots of local shops and places to eat nearby in the roads away from the main road the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure that we had any information we needed and advise about local amenities the hotel is decorated in a traditional style suitable to the period which is very well done i can see that other reviews have interpreted this d cor as tired but although perhaps there is some wear on the carpets in some places the hotel is very clean and the overall look is well created it s probably best not to stay here if you like white bright minimalist style the bedroom was a little small but adequate and the bed was very comfortable and we had a view of the royal albert hall so very pleasant i would definitely stay here again
