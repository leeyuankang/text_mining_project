this is a charming hotel beautifully decorated and in an amazing location the staff were all very accommodating and pleasant the doormen were especially friendly and helpful and that just always helps to make your day go well i had a classic double room and it was restful and peaceful despite facing the road the traffic is really not a problem i had a wonderful weekend here
