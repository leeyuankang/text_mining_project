second time we ve stayed and this time room not so good looked a bit tired staff at bar and reception were excellent especially trevor staff at breakfast very pleasant but we had to ask for things which should have been offered eg sauces and also had to ask for them twice however it is a very comfortable relaxing place to stay in a first class location and we ll definitely be back
