this was an old country house stay but in london like stepping back in time but panelled bed well appointed room but with great bathroom but no bath just a large shower it was really spacious recently redecorated it was hot outside so the airconditioning was perfect the staff on duty when we arrived at pm were so helpful we parked on a yellow line outside until which was perfect for business trip the bed linen was luxurious and was very comfortable overall we would go back
