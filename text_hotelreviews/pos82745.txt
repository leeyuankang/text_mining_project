coming back to the gore after more than years we were naturally apprehensive but nothing to fear staff were all welcoming helpful cheerful bedroom was excellent with a bed you wanted to take home breakfast was absolutely superb with every anything you might need though we enjoyed the confusion created by another guest s demand for brown sauce eggs florentine matched any previous menu with smoked salmon on the side and again the serving staff were on the ball the location away from the maelstrom of city west end couldn t be better so stay here with confidence we loved the gore and each other even more on this magical re visit
