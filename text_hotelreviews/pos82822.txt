i wanted a hotel within easy walking distance of the royal albert hall and the gore certainly was it was literally just round the corner it s in a nice location between hyde park and the museum area for the victoria albert and the natural history museum etc and you certainly feel safe on the streets in the area lots of restaurant cafe choices within a stones throw on gloucester road too i love the individuality of the hotel it s not at all like a chain hotel and the staff were really friendly and welcoming allowing us to book in early and letting us leave our bag there after we booked out and always with a friendly smile we paid for a standard double room without breakfast through booking com i expect to pay that for a nice area of london and i have no complaint about that except for that price i really would expect to be able to make myself a coffee tea in my room the room itself was very pleasant with a nice view across queen s gate the bed and linen were really comfortable so full marks for that and the bathroom was excellent i cannot comment on the food as we ate out in the evening and found a great mews pub just round the corner for a delicious sunday lunch all in all did i enjoy my stay there yes i did would i go back again certainly especially if i was going to the albert hall
