everything the staff were proffessional friendly knowledgeable about london and nothing was too much trouble we were lucky to stay in the dame melba room which was a unique experience especially the bathroom i cannot recommend this hotel too much we decided to make this our regular london hotel from now on the restaurant and bar were excellent too location was great we got taxis straight away
