this is my time to the hotel and it is my favourite in london by far i love the atmosphere as you walk in created by the decor background music couldn t believe it when i heard my current favourite soul record by saun starr come on when i walked in in the lobby and very helpful staff the food is always impeccable and turned around very quickly the radio on chill when you walk in to your room gives an air of class comfort and welcoming they are always immaculate the shower always spacious and the bed like a hug in a cloud
