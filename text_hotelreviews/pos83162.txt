the hotel room was fantastic the bed was super comfortable and it was very quiet even though it s in a very central location the little breakfast bag in the morning was a lovely touch as well the design of the hotel is cozy and feels like home yet stylish overall the cleanliness was amazing the food at the restaurant was yummy the hoxton is very central to all the sights and only a one minute walk from holborn tube station very convenient indeed
