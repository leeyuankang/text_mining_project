the hotel is perfectly located in the center of london you can reach big ben westminster british museum st james park and other historical sightseeing just by walking for the longer trips tube station is minutes from the hotel staff is always at reception ready to help you we are thankful to the girl i m sorry for not remembering her name who provided us with a city map and rounded areas of shopping and cafes for our knowledge she also printed for us boarding passes it must be mentioned that the hotel is nicely decorated you shall see yourself it is really worth staying in somebody writes about rooms being too small i can confirm that they are small but you are not expected to stay in a room all the day while travelling to london for night sleep it is ok there is enough space to place luggage and some things no wardrobe but hangers
