i love this hotel this is just the style that i wish to have visiting a city very young and nice staff very comfortable and functional ambiente different to the classical hotel more made to share space and thoughts with the other guests it is a kind of community atmosphere were people are coming to talk not only to look to their smartphones and digital tools so it was a convivial atmosphere i liked it i felt in a very big living room the hotel s hall
