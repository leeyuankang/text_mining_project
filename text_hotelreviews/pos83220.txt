we loved everything about the hoxton from it s central location for us to daniel and all the other staff on reception who provided us weary travellers with all the information we needed then onto the comfortable rooms with all the added benefits sadly we didn t get a chance to use our free international one hour phone call opportunity but what a brilliant benefit for your international guests wifi was excellent the bed was super comfortable the hair dryer was first rate the shower and bathroom facilities very good and to top it all off you provided us with our breakfast bags at an early hour for our departure the next morning which we happily consumed while en route to heathrow airport thank you again we have already recommended your hotel to others including my brother who lives in london and from time to time has friends and acquaintances to stay in london i m sure he ll be recommending your hotel to them a first rate five star place in our books we will be back again from australia from time to time and will definitely be staying at the hoxton
