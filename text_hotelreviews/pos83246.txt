the bed was really comfy there were lots of little extras like milk in the fridge and separate shampoo conditioner and a really good dab radio the breakfast bags were really good to get you going in the morning rather than sitting around for ages waiting for a full breakfast everything was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was super modern and user friendly
