upon arrival the staff were lovely very informative and friendly i absolutely loved the style of the hotel it was so retro and quirky it didn t have that uptight stuff feel to a normal hotel i ve never stayed in a hotel like it the little touches in the room just made it all the better the retro radio the milk and free water in the fridge nice to not have the pastursied milk when we came back after our night there was a dj and it was so busy felt like a bar than a hotel although once in our room it felt like our own little home staff were fantastic and was such a chilled atmosphere couldn t fault it
