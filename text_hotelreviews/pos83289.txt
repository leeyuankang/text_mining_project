great location lobby always crowded with students and young people either working on macbooks day or drinking evening rooms are super tiny but efficiently laid out and you really are only there to sleep great beds and down comforters help breakfast bag is a nice touch as is electric teapot in the room my room faced the street but noise was not a problem at all and i am very sensitive to it desk staff very friendly and helpful restaurant staff was a mix some great some seemed stressed
