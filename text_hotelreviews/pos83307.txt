there was a great atmosphere as soon as you entered the hotel the bed was comfy and we liked being able to adjust the room temperature we were well placed for our visit to the dominion theatre just a minute stroll as well as for covent garden the room was clean and had everything we needed although one bath towel seemed a little mean we could have asked for another one excellent soundproofing too as the hotel appeared to have become somewhat of a nightclub on our return from the theatre with bouncers at the door which took us a little by surprise we did not hear a thing in our room which led to a good nights sleep
