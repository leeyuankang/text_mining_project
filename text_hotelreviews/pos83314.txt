great location for the west end excellent relaxed welcome at reception bed and bathroom new and excellent plus for a big fridge with fresh milk and complimentary breakfast bag the bar is relaxed during the day and lively in the evenings to suit all tastes however the rooms are really well sound proofed all in all they nailed the vibe for me even had cool jazz on the radio when i entered the room real pity about the housekeeping though
