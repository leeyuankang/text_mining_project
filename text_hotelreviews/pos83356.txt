a really fun place to stay and what a location only a few minutes walk away from covent garden loved the eclectic d cor and the trendy vibe of this place my room was a double but was pretty compact not a lot of room if you had big luggage with you and very little clothes hanging space for a one night stay in london though excellent everything very clean a comfortable bed and a quiet room liked the breakfast bag left outside the door in the morning a banana granola and orange juice just enough to keep you going until coffee time nice to have a fridge in the room and some actual milk in it too
