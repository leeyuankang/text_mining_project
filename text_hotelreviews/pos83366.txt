i love this hotel very busy with loads of buzz the reception wasn t the usual stuffy quiet place where you feel you have to whisper it was busy with lots of people lounging on the great furniture never seen as many apple products outside of an apple store decor and furniture was a great mix of industrial and mid century modern great location and only minutes walk from covent garden very quiet in the room wasn t aware of anything in or outside of the hotel definitely be staying again think i ve found my favourite london hotel
