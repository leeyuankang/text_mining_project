reception desk staff was great friendly supportive and also taking their time to answer our questions and finding solutions room was always properly cleaned and tidy despite being a bit small great interior downstairs at the reception bar area bit ace hotel style and it felt like a local hangout for afterwork drinks and socializing restaurant food was great as well
