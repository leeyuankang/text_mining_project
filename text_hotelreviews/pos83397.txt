excellent location beautiful decor very helpful staff great value for such a central location in london even though rooms are small the design is very compact and doesn t feel crowded staff was amazing and even accommodated my early check in request for free provided a free yet delicious breakfast goody bag every morning restaurant bar downstairs is also great free wifi across the property highly recommend for short stays in london
