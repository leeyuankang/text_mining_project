our stay at the grand royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room the staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options we loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too we were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit london we highly recommend the grand royale
