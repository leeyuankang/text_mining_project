from arriving at the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful the guy behind the bar mickayl i think was brilliant and helped with best directions to where we wanted to go the breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff in here were pleasant the hotel itself was in a good location mins from earls court tube station which was great for getting around london we were on the floor of the hotel and it was very quiet the bathroom could have done with some tlc on the paintwork but nothing major the bar prices were reasonable with a pint of lager around so not bad for london there is a sainsburys just down the road which was great when we were unpacking on the friday to find we had no toothpaste with us
