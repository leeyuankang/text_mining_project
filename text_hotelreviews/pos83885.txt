the hotel was clean and the bathroom was spotless it is an old hotel but adds to the charm the double room i stayed in so really tiny so it s good if you don t plan on spending much time in there an added attraction they give you a smartphone that you can use during your stay with free data and calls i ended up using that in my room as the wifi was hard to connect to
