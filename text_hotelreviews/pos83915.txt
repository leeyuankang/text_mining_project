the hotel provided a free smartphone that was locally connected preventing the traveler from having to obtain a local sim card or burner phone this was such a great perk since we always use our smartphone for gps etc but rather not have to spend time locating a place to purchase local sim card the front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating
