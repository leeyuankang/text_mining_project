this hotel punches well above its weight it s like they took my list of things that really annoy me about hotels and made sure none of them were present i was incredibly impressed with this hotel firstly it s not silly money for the location that got me there in the first place and it exceeded my expectations in every respect check in is excellent lots of staff all of whom were friendly efficient this is repeated throughout the hotel it s properly crewed and service is excellent in every department early check in was handled charmingly and luggage stored properly unusual for many hotels our room was superb small but very high quality they managed to fit in a proper sized desk decent armchair nespresso machine and all the usual gubbins decent sized bed with great pillows decent linen the aircon actually cooled the room too the hotel is in an ugly purpose built concrete block and the huge advantage of this was the rooms are very quiet interior d cor is great all comfy and great ambience bathroom was a decent size and most unusually for hotels these days had enough shelving for all your stuff and a mirror that was actually lit enough to use breakfast is impressive firstly you get your tea and coffee within seconds of sitting down it s always a pleasant shock when that happens it s well staffed the food is kept stocked and the quality is high they ve got all the usual stuff and the quality of the cooked breakfast was great this place was a treat really enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back
