the hotel is located minutes walk away from earl s court station i would not rate this hotel as stars but a high level star the standard room was very small and the bed very uncomfortable the staff were nice and very helpful booking com states that the standard room has a mini bar and provides bathrobes this was not true i spoke to reception and the lady confirmed that there were no minibars in standard rooms when i asked if this was a small room and not the standard she confirmed that it was the standard and that the small room was smaller but the reception provided me with a few soft drinks free of charge
