i chose mercure hotel as it was the first time i was travelling to london and i wanted to stay in a central location this would turn out to be helpful in my commute and enable me to get my work done easily as well upon entering the hotel the reception made the check in process quite easy but after getting into the lift things were quite messy some good things about the facility is that it has a good lobby where you can sit and spend some time the tables outside on the road also makes for a good view the hotel is located close by gloucester road tube station with a minute walk also it is close to favorite tourist destinations like natural history museum victoria and albert gallery harrods and some other famous places
