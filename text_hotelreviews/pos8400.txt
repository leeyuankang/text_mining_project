the location was wonderful near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites the public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website that s why i picked this hotel in my price range all the hotel rooms in london were extremely small but the grand royale london hyde park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest the rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious
