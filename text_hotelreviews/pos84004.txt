great location just minutes walk from earl s court tube station with earl s court itself just a little further very convenient for getting around on the district or picadilly lines short tube trips for paddington station and the leicester square area lot s of bars and restaurants along earl s court road and surrounding area breakfast was excellent though the breakfast room is a little small so could be quite busy the bedroom was quite well protected from noise outside the hotel though noisy inside see negatives and the curtains were pretty effective at keeping out morning sunlight too staff were all great with us
