the hotel was conveniently close to hyde park where we liked to walk it was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services a convenience store was close by the hotel is a lovely old london town house style and the reception hall and public areas i would describe as baronial the staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable
