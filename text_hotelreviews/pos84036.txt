hotel felt quite quaint and not overcrowded for a city hotel and staff were very friendly professional and efficient at their roles within the hotel made it a hassle free stay for the night they even looked after my bags on the second day when i checked out to go to a exhibition and picked them up on the way through at the end of the day also as standard they have a mini bar fridge which comes with complimentary soft drinks two bottles of water but has no sensors so you can stock up on cold beverages of your own from round the corner at the local sainsbury s without fear of being charged when you take a drink out was quite nice to have in a standard room it seemed nothing was to much of an effort for them no matter what you asked for or needed in short with my one nights stay i was impressed with the mercure as the standard rooms are a normal size affair not to small but not yet massive with a nice bath shower set up and comfortable beds with nice pillows could not fault the cleanliness through out my stay either
