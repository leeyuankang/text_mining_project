the bed was extremely comfy although the room was a little bit smaller than expected the bathroom was spotless and filled up with complimentary products the staff was friendly and helpful i went down to the bar around midnight when they were closed already but they opened it for me and allowed me to take all my drinks up to the room would highly recommend
