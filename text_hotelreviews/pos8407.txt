we stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel we loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom we were adults and one toddler in this suite breakfast was great as well and the location right next to hyde park and kensington gardens is perfect for kids mommies can go shopping on the westbourne grove
