had a very enjoyable stay at the royal garden hotel even though had traveled to see phil collins in concert which was cancelled still went down for the weekend the staff were so friendly and professional we felt at home from the minute we walked though the door the views of the park from our window were stunning and there were plenty of places to eat and drink around the hotel re booked for november already
