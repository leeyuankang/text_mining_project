to be honest the reason why i chose this hotel is because it seems like the one of the closest and nicest hotel close to holland park where my sister lives and although maybe it is not stars from the entrance including the guys at the door to the reception and concierge they were all very helpful and so caring as well as the people at the breakfast thus the options at the breakfast are great like the chia seed porridge etc and thus the gym is just a big big bonus which is really big and open hours and has all sorts of equipments except the weights for the legs i have to say in general i was really surprised i will definitely come back and the dim sum restaurant at the top is a must vist place the best in town
