exec double room was spacious and the bed was supremely comfortable requests for extras pillows etc were not a problem we had a second floor room not facing the road and it was very quiet also no real problems with guest noise or late night party animals brilliant location for the ra and concerts and some nice local restaurants if you get time to explore not a problem if we had of being staying for longer than a weekend never ate in the hotel so no comment on this topic
