great location right next to kensington palace fantastic staff parking at the hotel and the valet parks your car too the hotel arranged some lovely chocolates as we were staying for a birthday room of a great standard bathroom huge and immaculate for central london i thought this hotel was exceptional value for money it is far superior to many other hotels in the area charging a lot more
