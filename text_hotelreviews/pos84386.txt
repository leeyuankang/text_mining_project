we had a garden view room on floor fantastic view across the lake park and right over to the city sunrise at was spectacular arrival by car is a bit fraught as there is not much space out front but helpful staff took the bags and the car and all were whisked away room very clean comfortable good wifi and well laid out breakfast is only advertised at each but there are actually a lot of other choices in the end we cancelled our breakfast booking up the road and had one in our room no room service charge between us which was ample and good value and good quality
