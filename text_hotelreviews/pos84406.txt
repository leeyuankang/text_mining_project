this is our absolute favourite hotel in london this is mainly due to the wonderful helpful staff and their great service starts the moment the car door is opened the quality and size of rooms bedding and bathrooms are great too breakfast is absolutely wonderful with a fantastic selection of all things desired but the service all over the hotel is the best of all
