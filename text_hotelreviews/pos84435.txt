although the hotel is very central the rooms are lovely and quiet i loved the comfy bed and fabulous bedding the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the restaurants are good also i stayed by myself this time and felt very safe the concierge staff are very helpful and have great knowledge of the city and what is going on i have stayed there twice and will stay again
