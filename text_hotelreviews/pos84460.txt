perfect location and easy to commute to central london oxford street or knightsbrige for example room service will always arrive earlier than the estimated time so service was not only quick but at a high standard staff were beyond helpful friendly and polite room and bathroom were exceptionally clean upon arrival and the bed was super comfy the view from the room was also amazing but the view from the ming jiang restaurant was even better one of the best hotel stays i ve experienced
