overall my stay was great in this hotel comfy and cosy staying i had a room with view to the hyde park it was stunning the hotel has helpful staff good location as many things near it such as pharmcy supermarkey coffee shops more importantly i felt the hotel has good security in terms if i lost my key card they only give when they check i would definitly choose to stay in it again
