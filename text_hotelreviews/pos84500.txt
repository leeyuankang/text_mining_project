definitely book the garden rooms they re worth the money the garden rooms were lovely and i asked for a high level room which was provided so the views were amazing overlooking kensington gardens i also requested for a message to be left in the room when we arrive for my mother as this trip was her gift on mother s day the staff not only left a message but also a plate of delicious chocolate truffles they definitely go the extra mile the hotel is situated at the start of kensington high street so access to great shopping is a stones throw away twin beds were nice and comfy and the bathroom is great
