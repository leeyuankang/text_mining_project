we stayed for three nights over new year and i was very happy with all aspects of the hotel i found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful the location on top of kensington high street is perfect for shopping eating out albert hall kensington palace or walking in the park there are great views of the city from their top floor restaurant and cocktail lounge the staff up there squeezed us in for dinner one night even though they were fully booked so thanks for that we also received a late check out at no extra charge which was much appreciated
