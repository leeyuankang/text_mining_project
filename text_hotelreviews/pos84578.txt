this is an excellent hotel which unfortunately could only stay for nights the hotel staff were very professional and took their jobs extremely serious to keep up the standard as much as possible the room was nice clean spacious and had a lovely view of london the hotel s lifts were extremely fast and i rarely waited more than a few seconds for the lift breakfast was good the location of the hotel is extremely convenient you may decide to have a nice walk in kensington gardens hyde park which is right next to the hotel take the bus to central london oxford street from next of the hotel or walk down the road and get the tube from high street kensington station a taxi is on standby most of the time outside the hotel in a short note if you want a comfortable stay in a great location you may wish to pay a bit more and stay at this hotel
