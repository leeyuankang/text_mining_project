just by chance i hit upon a hotel with a history it appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story the lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows the breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern apparently edward bought this house for his mistress lilly langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate the hotel is in an excellent position being near queensway tube station on the bayswater road and right opposite kensington gardens and about minutes walk from the palace it took me minutes to walk through the gardens and across hyde park passing the serpentine and rotten row to reach marble arch
