loved the hotel this is my forth time over years on arrival the receptionist was so helpful couldn t do enough for us we got complimentary tea and coffee of choice on arrival the rooms was clean and looked like it had been refurbed the staff are always friendly and happy to help location is probably the best around right next to the palace and hyde park
