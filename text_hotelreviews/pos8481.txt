my sister and i bought our parents a trip to london for christmas and we all went in the end of march we stayed at grand royal hyde park for nights and enjoyed every minute of it the staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old london interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in london anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok the hotel is basically across the street from hyde park and only min walk to queens way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around london very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything so yeah definitely a place we would all return to a really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in london in general awesome staff and service great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening will definitely return
