the service was excellent and i was made to feel so welcome throughout my entire stay with my fianc if i needed any help with organising something even before my stay they were instantly responsive and wasn t left in the dark or having to wait more than a day to receive a response especially as this was a surprise for my fianc the staff were always polite and accomodating in all honesty the best decision i made to introduce my other half to paris for his first time stay
