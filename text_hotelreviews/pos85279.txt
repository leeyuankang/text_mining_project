great little hotel in a fabulous location minutes walk from russell square tube and easy access to central london attractions area is beautiful and quiet the hotel reception areas are clean and classic and the staff are friendly and helpful the room was a decent size with very comfortable beds only down side was that it was very warm but the windows opened so not a real problem the bar prices were also surprisingly reasonable for central london
