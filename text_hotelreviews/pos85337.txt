the hotel is perfectly placed in close proximity to holborn and russell square underground stations the room itself was possibly the largest i ve stayed in in central london and was really nicely furnished we had a balcony with huge sash windows another rarity in london the beds were glorious and i didn t want to leave in the morning the hot staff were lovely and could to help enough even to flagging down a taxi for us shaftesbury avenue is only a taxi away so really handy for the west end shows
