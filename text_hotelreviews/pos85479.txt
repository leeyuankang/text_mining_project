the staff were all very friendly and helpful the room was very comfortable and the shower was powerful and hot i liked the selection on the tv and the fact that the bathroom had a speaker so you could hear the tv clearly plus the breakfast was lovely with the chefs cooking what you want and the waitresses getting drinks if you didn t get them yourself
