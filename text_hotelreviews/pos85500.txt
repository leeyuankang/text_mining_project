well presented hotel professional and welcoming staff closely located to tower bridge and borough markets room service was delicious try the fudge brownie you won t be disappointed facilities were amazing the rental bikes scattered throughout the city are a cheap and easy way to explore the city much better than a tight tight squeeze in the tubes
