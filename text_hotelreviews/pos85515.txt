the staff were brilliant so happy and helpful efficient and attentive i ve never had such great service at breakfast in a hotel before this hotel is very clearly new as it is absolutely spotless and the staff clearly take a lot of pride in their work the complimentary soft drinks in the room deluxe room were a nice touch to make me feel like i was getting more value for my money
