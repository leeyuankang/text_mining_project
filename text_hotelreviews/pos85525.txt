the rooms were nice neat decor and just about the right size the hotel is clearly very new the breakfast deserves a special mention as it really was excellent minus the coffee i ve stayed at a few hiltons in the uk and on the whole they are nowhere near the standard you get on the continent but this place was different a definite step up from the normal english hilton standards most concierge desks in london are decent but these guys here really knew what they were doing and were worth every penny what they didn t know they either found out for you in minutes or it wasn t worth knowing just like in the movies if i was to go to london again i would definitely stay at london bankside well done hilton hats off
