great location superbly helpful staff they provide a computer and printer so i was able to print off my boarding passes easily room was very clean and bed comfortable didn t dine at the hotel but the afternoon tea looked amazing will try it next time just opposite hyde park and next to the tube station however we walked as weather was nice and it only took us minutes to walk to victoria apollo theatre to watch the show i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be central but also in a nice and peaceful location saturday morning walking through hyde park was picturesque also staff offer city maps and guides or any personal recommendations for those who don t know london very well the foyer is beautiful very exquisite and grand in my opinion a very good value for money hotel would ve paid twice that i paid for our stay was a great place to show my partner what london has to offer
