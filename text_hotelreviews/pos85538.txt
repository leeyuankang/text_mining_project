staff were fantastic could not do enough for you i loved the little touches here and there such as after booking in getting ready and then going back out i came back to the room late to find my bed prepared for me to get into it water next to the bed new towels slippers placed next to the bed lovely music on and the lights set on a lovely dim setting could not believe it even when booking a taxi the gentlemen at the door went down the road just to flag one down for me i have been to many of a star hotels but this particular one topped them all quality of service was amazing breakfast lovely will definitely be using again very soon
