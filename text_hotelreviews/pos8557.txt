the hotel more than met our requirements for our night stay we had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of as it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean the bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting we also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit the reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful finally the location is a real bonus as there are tube stops within minutes walk hyde park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops however if you don t mind a walk then the west end is about minutes way on foot we also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the lily langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special
