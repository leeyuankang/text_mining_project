the hilton bankside has got to be the standard bearer in the hotel hospitality industry this was my second visit there and the service and accommodations were again unparalleled the location is also ideal just adjacent to the tate modern and very close to both the southwark station on the jubilee line and burrough market though this is not a budget hotel it is also surprisingly affordable given the outstanding quality is it possible to be in love with a hotel if it is you ll find me on one knee
