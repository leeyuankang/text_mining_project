from the time we got there to the time we were checking out the staff at this hotel was phenomenal the rooms are squeaky clean and very spacious the bed was so comfortable we found it hard to get up we also had breakfast ordered up to our room which was great we really felt like they look after all of their guests we also tried out the swimming pool which was also very clean and quiet which was lovely and the opening hours are very ideal especially if you go out during the day you can have a cheeky swim in the evening i would definitely recommend this hotel and i would definitely stay here again
