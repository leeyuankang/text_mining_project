staff very friendly and welcoming upgraded room to executive suit which was beautiful lovely big bed fabulous bathroom and the shower was great we took advantage of the executive lounge food and drink we really liked the idea of using the room key to access the lounge and using it in the lift to gain access to our room floor it made us feel a bit important hahaha finger food was lovely waiters and waitresses were very friendly overall a lovely experience
