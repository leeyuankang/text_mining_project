the room was spotless and very spacious breakfast was lovely very tasty and a huge selection we didn t get to use the pool but it looked nice staff were friendly and welcoming they even facilitated my odd request of putting an inflatable zimmer frame in my friends room for his birthday politely without batting an eyelid thank you for the lovely stay this hotel deserves its high score
