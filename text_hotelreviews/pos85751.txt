the hotel is relatively new and as a result is immaculate where we saw including the public areas and the room there were some complimentary refreshments in the room which was a nice touch the bed was comfortable and as it was a king size it was very roomy the staff were very friendly both checking in and out and in the resteraunt for breakfast there was a very good selection for breakfast including good quality english breakfast and the usual cereals and pastries we had no issues and the hotel is well situated for both facilities and travel shop right next door if you need any extras very pleased all round
