the staff were exceptional from check in room service bar staff and when we checked out nothing was too much trouble and they genuinely couldn t do enough for us the fact the pool was open until was a real bonus good all night room service menu and a very stylish edgy feel to the property which was carried throughout the entire hotel spacious enough rooms making it a comfortable stay and with the shard tate modern and borough market around the corner the location was brilliant too
