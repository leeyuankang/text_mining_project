how quiet it was inside how efficient the staff was would do anything that you requested even on our last day when we checked out they looked after our bags for us until we got our train on the night when we asked for a taxi to kings cross they quickly got us one and transported our bags to the taxi very enjoyable stay for my birthday weekend
