staff were amazing couldn t help you enough it s a shame we were not pre warned of extensive renovation work to the hotel upon booking though enjoy a lovely breakfast in the bar upon request the breakfast room was very busy and noisy as the main restaurant was closed for building works rooms needing a bit of tlc as older but beds were extremely comfy bathroom was compact but very nice bath and facilities and our club room was huge i recommend here for a short stay
