the bathroom was very nice and well kept the male staff were very helpful at front desk at night and so were the general staff that helped carry your luggage they were very kind and helpful however there was a down side to the staff as they were let down by one female member of staff who i thought was quite rude in her mannerisms and the way she spoke and definitely needs to either try and enjoy her job or find a new one honestly working can be crap and boring but get over it we all have to work however not to discourage the other female receptionist who checked us out as she was very helpful and friendly
