booked this hotel as was going to royal albert hall to see russel howard location was great straight in on tube to kensington good room smaller than normal hilton but good for london and nights breakfast was good and plenty of variety staff were friendly we used tube into london and less than minute walk to ealing common piccadilly line straight into central london in minutes usually stay in covent garden but had to drive this time so this was perfect we will stay again
