it was our first time at this particular doubletree by hilton hotel and we couldn t fault anything the reception was warm and friendly we came early on the day of check in and the lady was happy to put our suitcase in the storage room until we returned later in the day when we could check in at the time of check in we received two delicious cookies and the room was equipped with a nespresso coffee machine a simply perfect combination everything was super clean and we had a great stay the location is fantastic as well very close to the centre a couple of minutes walk to the tube station we will definitely be back
