the hotel is situated just short distance from both ealing common and north ealing tube stations so extremely easy access to the centre of london to leicester square you can park really cheaply at north ealing station at the ncp car park much cheaper than the hotels on site parking the room although fairly small was decorated really nicely was very clean and the most comfortable bed i have ever experienced in a hotel breakfast was really good and staff were friendly and helpful there was an ipod dock which was very handy and nice coffee machine we were given a warm cookie each on check in which was a lovely and unexpected treat
