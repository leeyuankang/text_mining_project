this hotel was about a minute drive from westfield shopping centre there is plenty of parking on the premises check in was quick and easy staff were very friendly and welcoming we were given warm cookies on arrival which was a lovely touch the room was a good size and clean breakfast was good cereal pastries full english and option of omlette there were also pancakes which were very nice and another lovely touch on check out we mentioned to the receptionist sonia that the heater in the room was quite loud and disturbed our sleep and straight away sonia eliminated the parking fee and offered us a complimentary coffee from starbucks this was a very nice gesture and although we had a problem with the room i can see that the staff go out of their way to compensate and make our stay worth while i would definitely stay here again
