good value for money booked a b and b package we also chose it because it had reasonable rate on sight parking staff were some of the nicest staff we ve encountered efficient very pleasant and and helpful room a little dark but very comfortable clean plenty of towells and easily accessible floor quiet overlooking the car park bed was comfortable too hot drinks in room location for us was great as we were visiting relatives and had no need to go into the heart of london station close by min walk and only took about mins for south kensington sat nave led us straight to hotel so no problems with finding it would definitely use again
