avoid the quaint victorian places they are not charming just cramped often dirty and lacking any comforts the doubletree ealing was easy to get to on the tube minute walk from ealing common station the bus stop was directly across the street the room was great comfortable beds quality bedding and towels fast internet free seemed to have plenty of parking and the complimentary cookies tasty i booked the night before my stay and got a great rate bp
