we stayed at the hotel for the wembley cup final the location was excellent as the bus stop to wembley was just across the road with a journey of approx minutes to get there ealing common tube station was approx minutes walk from the hotel and ealing broadway tube was approx minutes walk so plenty of choices to get into london centre all the staff were very friendly accommodating and helpful the room was excellent and the breakfast was superb with plenty of choice i would definitely stay there again
