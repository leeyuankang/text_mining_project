great room modern and well appointed no bath in bathroom but very very good shower area modern and it worked well as well there was a birthday party in the hotel but the reception gave me a room away from the ball room there was no disturbance at all brilliant i was amazed how quiet it was though the lobby bar restaurant area was naturally busy and noisy this was saturday night after all close to tube station and facing ealing common for walks if that takes your fancy and you survive the inner orbital road a very pleasant stay
