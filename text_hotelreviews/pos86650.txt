hotel was fresh clean very well laid out and the staff were fantastic quite far out of town but very close to the tube so it was no bother at all and for the price we paid the travelling was more than worth it the local amenities had everything you could want too my only disappointment was the pillows they were practically non and didn t make for a good night s sleep at all but i kept forgetting to ask for firm replacements so it can t have bothered me that much i m sure the staff would have been more than happy to help had i raised it at the time all in all a fantastic wee place to stay i ll be back for sure thank you
