i was standing near bond street station by the traffic lights contemplating whether to travel back home to luton or stay a night as i only had to travel back the next day for training the booking was easy and within half hour of me booking i was in my room it was the best process ever for me that day i was very comfortable the staff were great because they interacted with me and noticed that i had stayed there before with that i was given an upgrade as you could imagine in my head bonus my day is getting better it s a great location for leisure of business
