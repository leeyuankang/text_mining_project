the hotel is located minutes away from underground stations so it s very convenient it s perfect for a stroll in hyde park as well as you just need to cross the road the hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie we had a club room and it was quite small it had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow the bed was small but very comfortable
