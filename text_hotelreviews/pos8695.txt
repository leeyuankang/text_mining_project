the room was tastefully furnished and very quiet i particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold christmas period the windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in england with kensington gardens literally minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park
