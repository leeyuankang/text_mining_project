the room was small yet expected in paris very clean and comfortable we described the decour as crisp staff were all very nice and helpful breakfast was great to start the day quickly hotel itself was very quiet we had an amazing view of the eiffel tower which is the main reason i chose the hotel walk to the tower was about minutes shopping nearby
