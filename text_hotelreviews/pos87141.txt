staff at first hotel were friendly welcoming and very helpful very helpful that they all spoke english the room was lovely clean and a good size with a comfortable bed definitely a perfect stay for a young couple the hotel itself was very well presented and clean throughout we did not hear a noise from any other guests at the hotel so was very peaceful we could just see the top of the eiffel tower from our room which was lovely great location with restaurants small shops etc around and right opposite the train station
