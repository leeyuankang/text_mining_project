location of the hotel is great it is opposite of cambronne metro station so it is easy to reach from the airport with change only hotel is close to eiffel tower and few other sight seeings few nice restaurants around makes eating and drinking very easy breakfast of the hotel was good fresh juice croissants and other delicacies
