the property was across the street from the underground and close to many of the sights we were interested in so location was great the staff was extremely helpful room was very clean breakfast was very good with good variety the warm chocolate chip cookies were to die for when we checked out we accidentally left our passports in the room and didn t realize it for hours the staff got them located for us and held them while we got back to london i can t say enough about how helpful their staff was
