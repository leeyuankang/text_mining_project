it was so easy to get to the hotel having flown into gatwick and jumped on the gatwick express the staff were very welcoming and helpful simple things like asking how our journey was where we were from and if we would like a london street map made it a very personal experience the room was lovely and clean the breakfast was beautiful and a huge selection we ate in the bar for a late lunch and it was delicious a wonderful hotel with wonderful staff
