check in out staff great breakfast staff also very efficient but due to problem on first night with bar staff we did not use the bar area again during our stay room fine everything to a decent standard we would have liked a kettle and coffe tea facilities in the room but had to do without which is not great when you want a drink when you first wake however as we were packing our bags to leave at the end of our stay we found these facilities hidden away in a draw quite frustrating but overall a good hotel twenty seconds walk to victoria station but the prostitutes eating mcdonalds in the bar is not good for this hotels image so we did not go in the bar again after the first night
