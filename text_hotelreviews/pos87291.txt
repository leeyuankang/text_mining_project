location to victoria station was very useful we choose this hotel for the location being so close to the victoria apollo something that could be used better to your advantage when advertising your plus points staff were accommodating for our request for all of us to be next to each other excellent choice at breakfast every taste catered for although we overlooked the station we did not hear any of the trains and would recommend these rooms we were on the higher floor and would say this would be better than being closer to the street
