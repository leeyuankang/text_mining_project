although the hotel was on a back side street it was convenient to most of things i wanted to do the staff was absolutely magnificent and responded quickly to all of my needs went my purse went missing they even offered to let me charge more on my bill so i had some cash luckily i recovered my purse at a local convenience store minus the money only pounds but the credit cards all intact i had occasion to eat in the restaurant very nice everything good and nice selection the concierge even walked me two blocks to show me the right turns for a strange street crossing
