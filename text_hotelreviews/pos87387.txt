location of this hotel is great a minutes walk from victoria station room was fantastic clean and comfortable although our air conditioning was not working once we reported it to reception it was dealt with brilliantly staff were friendly and went out of their way to help checking in with mira was a pleasure will definitely be back to this hotel when we visit london again
