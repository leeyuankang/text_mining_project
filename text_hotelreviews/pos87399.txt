we stayed one night two rooms for three adults at this hotel across the street from victoria station because our boat train left from there in the morning it proved to be a modern convenient clean and comfortable hotel with very efficient staff we arrived before our room was ready and they arranged to hold our luggage while we took a tour of london they gave good directions also check in check out was quick and efficient an overall good choice for our quick trip to london
