i was staying in a hotel that was an absolute nightmare i walked into the hilton doubletree hotel with tears in my eyes because of what i had went through leaving the previous hotel on such a short notice the gentleman and the lady right away gave me a bottle of water and helped me sort myself out and gave me a beautiful room to stay in at an amazing rate i was beyond happy with all they did i couldn t thank them enough i certainly will stay with them again when i visit london another time
