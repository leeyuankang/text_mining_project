i booked this hotel as a birthday gift for my brother he and his wife stayed in the hotel and because i had informed the hotel that it was his birthday on arrival they were upgraded on their room and on their return from an evening out there was a cake and a birthday card signed from the management it was a wonderful touch and made the stay for them even more special
