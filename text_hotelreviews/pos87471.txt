the front desk checked me into a dirty unoccupied room room key cards didn t work on occasions housekeeping staff on the floor walked past me without an acknowledgement of a good morning as if i was invisible whilst waiting for the elevator to go to the room the mini bar employee curtly told me he had to go first as he had deliveries to make no courtesy to share the elevator at all when i asked didn t the hotel have a service elevator he laughed and said no very strange for a doubletree hilton reception staff were courteous and helpful with the dirty room issue and key card issue good location but not the usual doubletree standards as in manchester london tower bridge and kuala lumpur suited my purpose on this trip despite the issues
