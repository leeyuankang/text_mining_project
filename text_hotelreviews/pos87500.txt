i appreciated the dining room and reception staff they were very helpful the concierge was absolutely excellent in dealing with an issue i had with my first room he inspected it and confirmed that it was too cold to be in and arranged to have me stay in a h hilton room which was warm clean and satisfactory if he had not done this i would have gone to another hotel for the night
