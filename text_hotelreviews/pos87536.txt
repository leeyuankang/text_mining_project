we were going to see wicked the musical and the hotel could not have been a more perfect location for this and made the theatre trip much more enjoyable not having to travel home being a central hub made it a good location for other sight seeing trips as well the staff were very helpful the room clean and very comfortable the welcoming cookie was lovely
