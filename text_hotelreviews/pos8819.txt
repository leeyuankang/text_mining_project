good location especially for access to paddington station for the heathrow express also a short walk to notting hill and portobello road the night staff are lots of fun and provide great service angels overnight julian carlos claudio agnelo it being close to halloween count dracula was roaming the lobby and bar our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel thankfully they changed our room with no issue we had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl
