entry to the hotel and lobby are very posh yet modest hotelemployers were all very welcoming and friendly plus helpful comfy bed nice room with excellent interior design bathroom was in good order though bowlplug was leaking scary with contactlenses so had to put washtowel over it had to wait long for hot water passing through the pipes to taps location of room on ground was nice facing the court smokers outside were a problem to me the location is excellent walking distance to underground but also walking to westminster abbey and parliament thames etc it is all nearby
