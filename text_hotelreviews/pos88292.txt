the staff couldn t do enough and were so friendly to our children the book is a really special touch and our daughter reciprocated with a lovely letter thanking the staff and saying we hoped that we could return we needed to move quick through breakfast in the morning due to taking part in a run they couldn t have done more for us and understood our needs as a family which was great
