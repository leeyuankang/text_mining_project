excellent location to visit the palace as we were particularly impressed with our car being taken away and parked for a comparable rate with the car parks in london took the stress out at the end of the journey the staff here are very attentive and the hotel is immaculate i was a little poorly in the morning so missed breakfast but my partner said it was excellent and the croissant and coffee he bought up to my room were very good we are frequent visitors to london and we will have no hesitation to book this hotel again
