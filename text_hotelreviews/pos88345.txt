many star hotels are nice but all a bit of the same however i feel like this hotel has more character than the average hotel as well as its great central location a lot of attention has been given to detail lovely grounds outside the front entrance that includes tress and flowers a grand lobby area with many staff at hand to support reception area toilets that have noce toiletries and flannels that can be used and placed in a wash basket nice deco in rooms and a very comfortable bed free bottles water as well as a good selection of teas and coffee a mini bar from which items can be purchased slippers robes and ironing facilities staff came in and turned over the sheets and left a lavender spray at night
