great location for westminster st james s park and houses of parliament beautifully presented hotel with large modern comfortable room plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby although a little quiet at weekend also lots of snack bars if you don t have breakfast at hotel good strong shower paid for two nights through booking com which i think was good value for the location and comfort of hotel short walk to st james s park underground which was handy for heathrow just under hour crossing platform to change at baron s court
