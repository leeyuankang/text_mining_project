the staff were not just attentive but genuinely friendly the building and the room itself were beautiful it s in a great location to access central west and south west london and surprisingly easy to get to east london via old street it s a little tucked away from the main thoroughfares so it s peaceful during the day and quiet at night ground coffee and a cafetiere in the room was a much appreciated touch
