we found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in london in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds upgrading to a club room provided us with a lounge area on the floor which was very nice as the rooms are small the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean the location is excellent the hotel is within a minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores the staff was very friendly and helpful
