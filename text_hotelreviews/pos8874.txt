the hotel is rich in history and in great location for transportation food and entertainment the staff was very helpful the room itself was large for london and had ac but the bathroom was tiny and claustrophobic we were told all other floors had larger ones we would definitely stay there again but not in that room laundry was available just a minute walk away
