building is very old but nicely maintained bed quality was excellent and quality of toilettes are very good we booked family suite and there are three single beds in children room but we have a teenage daughter so they gave us two connecting rooms later which were much better the rooms are facing back of building which is better than facing road because it is more quiet and you can keep window open
