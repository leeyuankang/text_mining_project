this is my favorite hotel i have stayed here three times and never been disappointed it is located right next to the louvre and the tuileries gardens near a stop on metro line and within easy walking distance of the paris opera and the musee d orsay the hotel is in an original haussmann building with decorations in art nouveau style an old world parisian style pervades the building and the excellent service but a recent remodeling has made the rooms and the bathrooms state of the art many of the rooms have eiffel tower views we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the eiffel tower suite with a table on a small balcony where we could have breakfast overlooking the eiffel tower the louvre and many of the top paris monuments hotels in paris can be expensive and this one is but we left with a feeling of money well spent
