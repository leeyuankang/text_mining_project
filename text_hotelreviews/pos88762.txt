we were lucky to have one of the few rooms with a view of the eiffel tower which was wonderful i liked that the windows were double paned and we could open them up for some fresh air and an even better view of the eiffel tower the location of this hotel centrally located for any traveler who is wanting to see the main and best highlights of paris it s right next to the louvre museum and the jardin des tuileries and other prominent museums the bus and metro lines are very close with quick access to the other sites to see the concierge was helpful the night before we left to get us an early taxi to the airport the bar and terrace looked beautiful but we did not visit them
