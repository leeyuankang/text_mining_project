i was a bit nervous traveling by myself not knowing much french from the few days before when i needed to arrange taxi service from the airport to when i arrived hours before checkin and the accommodations they made for me to the delicious room service albeit a bit expensive excellent the room itself was beautiful the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom well lit and very clean every staff member i interacted with was so kind so polite the location of the hotel is right in the heart of paris across the street from the louvre and walking distance to all the major paris attractions i will definitely be back
