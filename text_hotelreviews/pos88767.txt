wonderful location near all the interesting sites especially the louvre lovely view from eifel tower junior suite room and bathroom beautiful newly furnished and with all mod cons but in the old style bed very comfortable hotel kindly gave us a bottle of champagne to enjoy and delicious chocolates on the pillow at night a good old fashioned star hotel as it should be breakfast very good only had it once in the hotel but they forgot to charge us for it and when we pointed it out to reception they waived it which i thought was very professional and much appreciated great hotel on the whole
