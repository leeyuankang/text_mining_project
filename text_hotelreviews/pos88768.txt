the hotel regina was in the perfect location to get to all the important sites in paris the hotel staff was friendly and helpful the old world charm of this historic hotel was just what we wanted our family room was perfect for us with our children it had lots of room especially for a hotel in paris and having the fully fitted bathrooms was great our room faced the louvre but we had a view of the eiffel tower from our small balcony there was no noise from the street below thanks to the double windows the cleaning staff was excellent and our girls loved the turn down service at night the food at the restaurant was good and the bar stayed open late one evening so i could work
