our room was magnificent a perfect view of the eiffel tower paris eye and of course all the beauty of paris the staff were far exceeding even our expectations of a first class hotel they went out of their way to make us feel at home advising us to be sure to try the bar across from the hotel entrance on the corner and their restaurant is filled with staff that is at once unobtrusive yet attentive the service and food must be experienced to understand that without a doubt not a dinner but an epicurean delight of ambience and great food across the street on the corner is a wonderful bar bistro that has scrumptious salads and main dishes that were less expensive than i would have expected for the quantity and quality of the food a must do when staying at the hotel another tip grab the two day hop on hop off bus pass for around euros and explore all of paris the pass is far cheaper than trying to get a taxi in some areas my wife loved the shopping so guys wear comfy walking shoes and enjoy the people of paris
