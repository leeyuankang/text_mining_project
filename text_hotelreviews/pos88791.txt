this is a gorgeous hotel directly across the street from the louvre and within walking distance of most attractions the building is classic elegance with high ceilings ornate woodwork yet it has been updated with all the conveniences you d want it is very quiet even rooms looking out over a busy street are very quiet this is definitely where i ll stay when i return to paris
