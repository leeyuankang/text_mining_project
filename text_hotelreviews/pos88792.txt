i was taking my girlfriend on a surprise trip to paris prior to deploying with the army for months i booked a normal room that stated it had a view of the louvre i explained it was a special occasion during the booking and asked that if possible we could get a good view of the louvre when we arrived we were greeted by the hotel staff and i was waiting for what i assumed would be the room i booked however we were informed that after seeing my request they had upgraded us which i thought was really lovely little did i know that they had actually upgraded us to the eiffel tower suite it was incredible and the room was laid out with petals etc on the bed and in the bathroom it had the most amazing view of the eiffel tower i could not praise this hotel and the staff enough it was absolutely fantastic in every way and i absolutely recommend anybody staying here my best hotel experience hands down
