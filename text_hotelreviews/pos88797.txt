our stay at the hotel regina was excellent in every way the hotel is beautifully renovated modern amenities but with traditional charm my bedroom was a good size not particularly big but roomy by parisian standards with a magnificent view there was complimentary instant coffee and a coffee pot so i could fix myself a cup of coffee before starting the day the bed was very comfortable and the room extremely clean the bathroom was a very good size with soft big towels not commonly to find in french hotels and a good sized shower the staff was extremely courteous and accommodating the hotel s location is perfect within walking distance of many famous sites and great neighborhoods and very close to metro stops and all this came with the most reasonably priced rate i have ever seen i would have expected this experience to cost deservedly so at least three times what my room cost i can t rate this hotel highly enough i would go back there in a heartbeat a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location with superior staff
