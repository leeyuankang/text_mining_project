this is a magnificent grande dame hotel situated right in the heart of the opera district directly across from the louvre i am a canadian and stayed in this hotel for eight nights during the christmas season i don t speak fluent french but the staff were extremely accommodating with the english speaking guests everyone from front desk housekeeping to the concierge as well as the lounge and restaurant they are also all very accommodating and friendly the rooms are spacious and well kept very elegant and clean every few days i would have a full bowl of fruit and chocolates left in my room clean fluffy robes and slippers a towel warmer in the bathroom and windows that open for fresh air and a beautiful view the concierge was extremely helpful in helping with tours directions prices are surprisingly comparable to many other hotels that are more run down i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of paris in the lap of luxury i will definitely be booking this hotel again as i love the city of light
