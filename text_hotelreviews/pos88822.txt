beautiful hotel star quality all the way through everyone is very friendly and the attention to detail is spot on we had a view of the eiffel tower and was a great room in fact the family room was two connecting rooms which is great as the kids think they have a room of their own and bathroom but they are under easy watch still concierge and doorman are so ready to help you on anything location is from the tuileries metro station that is good because you are sort of in the middle of all the main places to see louvre is literally round the corner you cannot be better placed rooms are spotless and wifi works impeccably just have to do a relog in every hours expensive but it is star and you get what you pay for well recommended to anyone who wants to enjoy paris in style
