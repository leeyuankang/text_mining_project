i loved my greetings from staff at reception from the minute i arrived to the minute i got into my cab to leave the staff were wonderfully competent in both french and english and i can only thank them enormously for respecting my attempts at conversing with them in french they consistently praised my french pronunciation and encouraged me all the way to use my language i felt totally at home and very very welcomed my room was to die for with a magnificent little french balcony overlooking the beautiful tuilleries gardens as well as the eiffel tower even though the hotel is located in arrondisement special thanks need to be given to franck and to delphine on reception with whom i shared some delightful if somewhat broken on my part conversations in french a wonderful experience i highly recommend the hotel
