from reception to housekeeping the staff was amazing very friendly and efficient and went the extra mile to make your stay perfect the hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms large and luxe especially for paris the location was unbelievable i was traveling with a year odl the most difficult of guests and it was very easy including special toiletries for her and a little robe we stayed on the third floor and booked the delux and premium delux room one was slightly larger than the other but maybe not enough for a price difference they provided an iron on request and my mini bar stopped working and it was quickly replaced the hotel and rooms are like their official pictures so no worries there there are lots of cafes nearby so never opted for the breakfast there but ordered room service once fried eggs etc the eggs were oversalted the first time so just make sure you specify we will definitely stay here again
