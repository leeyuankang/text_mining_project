i loved the atmosphere in the grand r hotel historic deco and reception incredible charming i also really liked the fact that the staff changed my room straight away when i didn t like view straight into concrete wall and gave me a nice room top floor this room was cosy and warm with view of roof tops the porter was extremely helpful and nice too
