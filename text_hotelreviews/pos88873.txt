we absolutely loved our stay hotel staff were amazing they booked us a table in the michelin star restaurant on a short notice and let us to check out one hour later which was fantastic as we like to lay in and not to be rushed out of the room in the morning the bed was so big and comfortable the bathroom was beautiful we will definitely come back
