staff at the hotel is very friendly and adequate my husband and i enjoyed the late night drinks at the bar very good service with good wines the location is perfect with louvre is just across the street many dining options too pretty easy to get breakfast from the mccafe which is at the other end of the street the whole family enjoyed our stay in paris because of the hotel
