the staff was amazing i became very ill just as i had arrived there and they called in a concierge doctor for me whom was there w in one hour then they rushed out and picked my meds up for me they made it so i could fly out the next a m and not have to spend another day in bed there they were all lifesavers the bed was so comfy too room was small and there was some noisy construction going on below me but the way they helped me during my awful illness was remarkable
