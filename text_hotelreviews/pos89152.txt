the staff were very friendly and helpful the corridors and carpets leading to the room were very shabby and the paintwork poor the room itself was adequate and clean for the one night we stayed i would not have wanted to stay more than one night but as we had an early train to catch from the station next door the location was perfect looks like it needs a revamp and a tidy up
