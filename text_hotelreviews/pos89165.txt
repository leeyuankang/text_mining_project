the location of this hotel is superb only metres away from the mainline train station gare de lyon and the tgv s heading west and south and the metro line which is only a couple of stops away from exchange stations which take you anywhere in paris both stations can be reached without getting wet during february s drizzle the housekeeping staff are excellent they found my wife s lost earring and kept the room spotless the breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food available and everything i sampled was excellent across from the station there are two fine restaurants i can t decide which was the better i will definitely stay there again
