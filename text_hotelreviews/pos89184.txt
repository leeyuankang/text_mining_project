the position right on the top of gare de lyon where we had to take a train at to go back to italy is amazing with no effort we were on the train in addition the service at the arrival and after is of high level for example i asked for an early check in and i obtained it every place of the city is easily reachable through a taxy or the subway right under the hotel
