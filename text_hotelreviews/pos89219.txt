it is at gare de lyon and when you have an early train it just doesn t get any better the room was very comfortable and quiet given the location the staff very friendly and helpful i got in late but was still able to get a nice bar meal in the lounge bar although next to gare de lyon there are lots of places to eat near by but when you re on your own and it s late its great to just eat at the hotel and not expensive
