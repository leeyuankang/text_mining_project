the front desk staff really helpful especially when i am having trouble connecting internet on my sfr simcard phone they tried as much as they can to really help me and i really appreciate with all their effort as for the room its nice though its abit small spaces and small toilet but its just perfect for me my husband since we only need it to stay one night so we can catch up our early train to italy the next morning overall i must say i have no negative comments about them all excellent
