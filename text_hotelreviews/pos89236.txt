the hotel s location is very nice the receptionists are very welcoming and very helpful to any problem or question to the privilege type of room in which the minibar and cofee expresor were free were nice we had our tea and cofee in every morning in our room everyone should know that for the room a euro deposit will be blocked from your account during the stay amount which will be unlocked at the time of your check out but depending on the country where you are from or the bank that you are working with the unlocking of this amount can take up to weeks this is a normal banking procedure
