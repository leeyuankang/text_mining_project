for the money i thought the room could ve been a little bit bigger there was barely enough space to walk around the bed the bathroom was great the breakfast buffet was good but i got food poisoning from the room service food late one night the bedroom walls were all dirty and the trim needed a paint job needs new wallpaper quite badly and the woodwork throughout the whole body of the place is long overdue for a full restoration i read that it was last done in so it has a bit of a tired feel the location was ok except for trying to get out to a good club but to be fair there was one in the area that just happened to be closed for an event it s colourful there and it was nice to enjoy the park
