it was really central without the hustle and bustle of a city center so it was very quiet and nice plenty of restaurants around the hotel as well as boulangeries which was fantastic just a minute walk from denfert rochereau metro and rer station and the catacombs of paris they have a nearby franprix and monoprix as well so if you re on a budget you can get your breakfast and lunch food from there
