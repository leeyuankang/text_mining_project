a small hotel but nicely located near many bars and restaurants it s a minute pretty straight forward walk to the eiffel tower the room was great nice comfortable bed with big tv screen windows can be openend to look into the streets when closed it s a quiet area even as my room was located on a corner overlooking a few restaurants the light system works with a button panel next to the bed which you need to play around with a bit one of them incl a buzzer to open the door not unsafe just makes an expected noise if you try to switch off the lights the toilet is separated from the bathroom which is nice if you travel in pairs the shower was nice clean and spacious i would be better to fix it higher than meter for people taller than this there is space enough so not sure why they fixed it like this can highly recommend this hotel for a weekend or longer if you need to be in paris centre
