loved everything about the hotel the location is perfect only a minute walk to the arc de triomph and about a minute walk to the padlock bridge and eiffel tower the staff are very friendly and are always there to assist help you can t comment on the food as we didn t eat in the hotel but i would definitely recommend this hotel and would return back to it
