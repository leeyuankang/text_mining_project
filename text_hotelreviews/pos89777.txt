excellent location we walked to every attraction we wanted eiffel tower arc de triomphe pantheon notre dame crypts louvre and enjoyed the shopping along the way easy metro access we just chose not to use it in favor of exploring above ground the facilities met expectations stayed in the junior suite room had a nice view along the street with little noise bathroom was large and modern staff was friendly and helpful worth buying tickets from the front desk for a couple extra euro than standing in lines at attractions smart phone was provided for the stay which was super useful for looking up restaurants and just navigating via google maps
