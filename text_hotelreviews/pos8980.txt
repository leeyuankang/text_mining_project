the building is beautiful old style with lots of carved wood and leaded glass natural light in the bathroom which was modern and super clean no dinner available in the restaurant but there are loads of places for dinner and breakfast also if you want just a minute s walk away the hotel is on a really quiet street with a busy one around the corner not just one but two tube stations a minute or two away
