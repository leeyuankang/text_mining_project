we asked for a room with a view and were delighted when on arrival we opened the curtains in see a lovely rooftop view right across to the eiffel tower the bed was very comfortable and the layout of the room quite stylish the swimming pool is well worth a visit small but very relaxing after a days walking around paris very central location with lovely restaurants within easy walking distance
