beautifully stylish modernised hotel perfect service from everyone from the friendly personal greeting every time we passed the reception to the breakfast and cleaning staff fantastic location most major attractions are within walking distance or a very short taxi ride if not a walker we would highly recommend this hotel for as romantic break
