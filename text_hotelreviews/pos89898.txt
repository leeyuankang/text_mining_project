the staff were great and really make a difference to a short break the rooms although small are fantastic and well thought out location is very good and close to opera the main bus terminal for the airport bus plenty of places to eat close to the hotel too it would take a lot to make us stay anywhere else in paris this was for my wifes birthday and she loved it
