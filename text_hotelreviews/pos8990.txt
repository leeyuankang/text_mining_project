i loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where i met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase it was good value for money and its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring kensington gardens and palace and the royal albert hall the staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast
