the staff went the extra mile for you all day every day when leaving to go out they would ask if we would like some water bottles to take with us and when coming back to the hotel they would ask us if we would like a hot drink and brought it to our room the one thing we really liked was we brought a bottle of champagne home and the next day they had put two wine glasses next to it which was extremely thoughtful the staff spoke very good english and helped us find the best restaurants and cheap taxi service and also a nice takeaway down the road when we wanted a quiet night in we would definitely stay there again because it is so clean but the main reason we would go back is because of the staff especially the two males who were on reception
