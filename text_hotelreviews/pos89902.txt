great modern hotel in a decent location yes the rooms are not the largest but it s a boutique hotel what do you expect this is paris you shouldn t be spending forever in your room they are well laid out and have all the mod cons staff very friendly and attentive they could not do enough to help even going as far as to make us hot drinks was cold and being genuinely interested in our day upon our return they could never do enough for us with great suggestions from directions to eating out i felt like these guys and girls made a good hotel a great one literally yards from the metro which is super cheap to get around don t be affraid it s super easy
