staff was friendly when my sister in law and i found our twin room too tiny to move around in they accommodated us and gave us a bigger room after the first night our favorite part was the hot chocolate in the room and this electric tea pot that boiled water amazingly fast loved the free wifi too the hotel s location was close to subway stations too which was very nice
