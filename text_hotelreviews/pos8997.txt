the photos in booking com give the impression of a delightful old hotel it isn t it s a bit down at heel in need of refurbishment the dark wood panelling in the reception area is a little gloomy and depressing not a bright start the room was tiny although clean and comfortable small but immaculately clean bathroom with a low pressure shower you don t really get a lot for your money here
