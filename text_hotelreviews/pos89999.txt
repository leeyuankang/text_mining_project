i stayed here on a business trip and it was absolutely fine the rooms are very quiet and the tram service just outside is perfect for getting into port de versailles which is stops and around minutes the staff were lovely and very helpful there was a problem with my air conditioning late at night and there was someone at the front desk to help i was moved to another room quickly and efficiently not a problem i recommend
