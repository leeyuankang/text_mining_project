great hotel with excellent staff very friendly and extremely helpful one of the staff i think he was called ignacio spoke excellent english although most are adequate speakers certainly better than my french location is perfectly located within a minute walk of a tram station and a metro station balard rooms very clean and the housekeeping staff were very friendly also very modern rooms and a comfortable bed although the fabric used for the covers is a little strange initially they operate an all inclusive policy no alcohol although you do get a glass of wine each night which was a great bonus food is tasty but simple snack food or packets of biscuits snackbites etc
