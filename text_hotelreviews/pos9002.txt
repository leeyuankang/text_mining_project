breakfast was great but a tad expensive staff were very friendly and helpful despite how busy the hotel was at that time the room was amazing extremely comfortable and modern the hotel is in a great location as it is very close to buses on bayswater road close to bayswater and queensway underground and easy to walk across hyde park
