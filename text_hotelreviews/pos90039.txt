the room was very much to my taste super sexy but romantic at the same time the neighbourhood is not as bad as they say it s the world famous red light district of paris but i had no problem and i never felt unsafe even though i walked around at night for a long time and it s really close to montmartre but most importantly it s a very romantic and sexy place to go as a couple but it s not sleezy at all staff and the style of the hotel is cool clean and mature there s just a lot of red and it easily gets you in the mood
