beautiful tiny romantic room overlooking pigalle the bathroom and bedroom had huge windows that opened out onto the square the building itself is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful the area is extremely diverse and full of life at all hours despite being on such a busy street and being a light sleeper i slept extremely well all six nights i highly recommend this place it was exactly like what i imagined a quaint hotel room in paris should look like
