this hotel is super quirky and definitely plunges visitors into the sexier side of paris located in the red light district type place pigalle it was quite fun to enjoy frivolous france the rooms are typically french with crazy pink walls and carpets we enjoyed the quirkiness of it it s literally meters away from the pigalle metro which is fantastic as lines meet there making travelling around the capital very easy the staff were also really amazing super helpful and they even upgraded us so that we had a jacuzzi bath for our honeymoon there is a fridge so you can store water or cooldrinks in your room if you need to they didn t have a problem with us bringing in snacks the airport shuttle was easy to organise and a fantastic service
