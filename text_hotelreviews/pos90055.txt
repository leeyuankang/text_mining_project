comfortable bed i would describe the decor as warm and unique plush not cold looking like modern business hotels charming we had a corner room with windows facing directions and there was a lot of light in the room during the day which is great but also big thick curtains to block out light when you are sleeping bathroom very charming with a big window and lots of natural light including hairdryer and toiletries big towels friendly and hospitable staff who stored our luggage after we checked out great boulangerie next to the mcdonalds across the street highly recommended location was both good and bad great for transport metro lines bus stops taxis right in front of hotel however if you are physically able i would really recommend walking to the center you will be pleasantly suprised at all the interesting and beautiful landmarks buildings city parks shops and cafes along the way lots of restaurants and cafes in the area cross the main street to montmartre district however check the other section for minus points
