excellent location out of the busiest tourist tracks of the city each room has fantastic personality i was lucky to stay in the louis vuitton room on the top floor which afforded unbeatable views of the sacre couer service all exceedingly friendly breakfast is provided but montmartre has so many colourful little cafes that i much preferred to eat at a new place every morning spa bath was a lovely touch
