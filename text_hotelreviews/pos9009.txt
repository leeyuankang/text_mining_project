interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades the lovely unaltered appearance of victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period we had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient good position with tube station very close queensway hyde park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for landmarks ie kensington palace serpentine diana memorial water feature nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for good choice in london
