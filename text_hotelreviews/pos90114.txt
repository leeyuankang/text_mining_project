we usually go to paris at least once a year and we kept changing hotel hoping to find one we really like we both decided to make this one our future pick every time we visit everything was great the location is fantastic the room was very specious clean modern and comfortable we loved it the staff was also particularly friendly and helpful being a ballet fan i loved the theme of the hotel and was even gifted mini ballerina shoes by the reception staff when they overheard my passion for classical dance attention to details was very much appreciated the bed was also very comfy and the bathroom extremely modern and well equipped we also appreciated the access to the car park which can be a real inconvenience in paris
