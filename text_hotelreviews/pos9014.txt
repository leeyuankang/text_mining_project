excellent location staff was very helpful for example we booked a tour through the hotel there was a miscommunication between the vendor and the hotel on where we would be picked up for the tour we had to take a taxi to catch up with the tour and the hotel compensated us for the taxi fare breakfast at the hotel was excellent
