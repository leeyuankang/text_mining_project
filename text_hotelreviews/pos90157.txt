absolutely loved our stay here we chose to pay a lot more than we normally would for a room because it was our honeymoon and then when we checked in the staff upgraded us everything about this hotel was wonderful the room was amazing so spacious and well furnished all the staff were so friendly and the hotel bar had a nice atmosphere a special thanks to virginie at the front desk who went above and beyond for us she made our stay extra special would love to come back again
