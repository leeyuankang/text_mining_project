the beds were very comfortable the room was amazing the triple windows filtered out street noise and yet could be opened when we wanted to look out and get fresh air we loved both the location and the size of this hotel as well as the service from everyone who works at villa opera drouot their friendliness and willingness to help us in any way possible was outstanding
