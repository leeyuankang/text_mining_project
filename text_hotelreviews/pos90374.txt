breakfast was amazing crepes croissants scrambled egg bacon baguettes cereal fruit and the list goes on good location right next to the gare du lyon lovely walk along the river to notre dame which is not far or pick up an open bus tour at gare du lyon which will take you around the area if you don t want to walk
