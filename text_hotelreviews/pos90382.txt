location of hotel was great access to all sites in paris next to the gare de lyon station where taxis also were very accessible food was fantastic but pricey but obviously being in paris can be expensive plenty of local restaurants that you can go with the prices you can afford everything was first class would definitely return the swimming pool was great for my children and adults we had a super time
