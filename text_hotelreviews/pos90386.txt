location was good there s an easier route from gare de lyon thru hall to frenay plaza the hotel is on the left side the tourist sites are easily reached via public transportation room was clean and comfortable despite our room facing the road it was quiet probably due to the double paned glass window and being situated on the upper floor breakfast was good had breads cereals cold cuts fruits and hot items
