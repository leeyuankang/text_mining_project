the staff were extremely nice i stayed here dec december and then also booked dec dec both stays were amazing i came before the scheduled check in but the hotel had a luggage storage room where we could place our bags in until check in time which was a bonus as we could see paris city room service was delicious as well as the buffet breakfast that was on offer location close to gare de lyon station was convenient for a tourist like me will definitely be staying here again see you in march patrick niko
