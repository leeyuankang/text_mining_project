the swimming pool is very good kids loved it we especially loved the family breakfast kids are very excited about the baloon sculpi we also find the cafe at the first floor at the corridor are very convinient even though we booked our breakfast we think grab a coffee is more convinient for someone doesn t have a breakfast as complimentray the location is very close to the subway even though the area is not as super polished we find it is very convinient to find resonable priced local restaurants around also the rooms are very quiet we hear nothing from the corridor my husband is very sensitive to noise even he was very happy with the quietness of novatel overall we two families with kids together enjoyed very much our stay in paris and hotel novatel we will recommend it to our friend for sure
