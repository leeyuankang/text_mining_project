the staff was friendly and helpful they spoke excellent english without reservation the room was modern and clean the location was great right next to the gare de lyon metro station which made it easy to get anywhere in paris the pool was great too although it is basically a lap pool it is meters feet inches deep in the middle which allows for some fun underwater diving my children ages and loved it
