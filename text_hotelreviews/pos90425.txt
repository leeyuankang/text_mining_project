we had a weekend stop on the way home from camping in the south of france and chose this hotel because it had an underground car park and we had a car full of stuff a roof box and bikes it didn t go quite according to plan as the car park head height was only so we had to take off the bikes and the top box luckily the super helpful staff found a big space in their storage room for us we particularly liked the swimming pool gym and the late checkout on sunday because we had a family room the rooms are really nice with modern decor overlooking a small modern square next to the station we loved the glass screen between the bathroom and bedroom which turned translucent at the flick of a switch
