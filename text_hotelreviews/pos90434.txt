very comfortable room in a good location for travellers we were staying overnight before taking the train to switzerland the bistro was good if unadventurous but fine for a dinner after a long day the bathroom was confusing at first as the shower had glass panels that meant someone in the bedroom could see the person in the shower then we worked out there was a button that made the glass magically become opaque yes we all played with it modern comfortable and undemanding accommodation
