hotel was just outside the train station from lyon which was very convenient central paris was only one stop by metro staff were very friendly and registration was easy and quick the room was very modern and had all the ammenities we needed the wall between the sleeping area and bedroom was clear glass which seemed strange until i realized there was a switch which darken the glass i would certainly stay here again
