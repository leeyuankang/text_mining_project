the staff at reception were very nice and helpful think they do everything from delivering an extra towel attempting to plunge our stopped up sink never drained properly still to helping us get our bags to the car down the street champagne coffee macarons nougat in the lobby were a bonus location is the main positive point public pay parking lot at the end of the next street was great very clean secure and excellent location
