this is not my first time at intercontinental le grand and it sure won t be the last this hotel is extremely well located in paris next to auber station on rer a min walk from lafayette galeries the breakfast at caf de la paix is very pleasant and varied the staff is helpful and very well trained it feels like a stars hotel even the classic room that is a bit small is very clean and comfortable and is very suitable for one person at the end of your trip you wonder who is directing this successful hotel well his name is mr christophe laure and i guess he is an excellent ceo i hope he will keep on the good job
