we booked a junior suites with balcony on arrival we were advised that the reservation we had and although it stipulates a balcony as a must the hotel denied and declined that it s non contractual she asked to go to booking com we insisted on a balcony they insisted that nothing is available we insisted again after hours we got room which is not a junior suites but had a cm wide balcony on scribe street the room overlooked the goods entrance and garbage collection entrance needless to tell you about the noise all night therefore i am asking you to contact them and reimburse the difference in rates due to their negligence and non respect of the booking
