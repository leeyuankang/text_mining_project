the location of this hotel is brilliant it is situated right across from trafalgar square charing cross tube station is within minute walking distance so it is very easy to access the tube line and get to wherever you want to go in london also because the hotel is based in the centre of london everything is pretty much close by big ben houses of parliament and the london eye are all within a minute walk from the hotel as is buckingham palace so even if you wanted to have a nice walk around nothing is too far from the hotel the room was great and had a very modern decor with pictures on the wall of very british things and london based things which was very nice the room was cleaned daily and was exceptionally well kept the staff were very nice and always on hand to help as well as wishing you a good morning and to have a nice day
