the building is gorgeous the staff are super helpful and it is excellent value for money especially in london it s around the same price as a generic chain hotel but so much nicer they even took our bags to the room for us the bathroom was so nice and clean and bright i was staying with my boyfriend and even though we re only they treated us as well as anyone else which isn t the case at every place also breakfast was great everything you expect from a buffet
