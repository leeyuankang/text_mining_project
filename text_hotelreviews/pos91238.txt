we had a very comfortable stay right in the heart of trafalgar square the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the location was convenient to west end theatres covent garden and a two minute walk from charing cross tube station we didn t eat in the hotel but sampled the many options available in close proximity we had a lovely breakfast at the cafe in the crypt in st martin in the fields a minute walk away i would recommend this hotel unreservedly and will definitely stay again when next in london
