the location is perfect close to everything and the hotel is easy to reach from paddington from heathrow and victoria from gatwick cab to paddington is mins and pounds the hotel has personality and it has always had warm atmosphere nice and cozy but chic and cool breakfast is good but the staff is too busy elsewhere to clean the tables
