the friendly and helpful staff really made this stay stand out we regularly stay in london hotels hilton park lane st martins lane the westbury etc choosing different ones each time and this rates as one of the best stays because of the fabulous staff any problems were rectified quickly it was my partner s birthday and they kindly put out a plate of sweet treats for him we will most definitely book again once the scaffolding has gone and the outdoor bar is open the location is fabulous cannot get more central
