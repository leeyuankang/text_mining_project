the arrival itself was very good the staff were very welcoming friendly polite and nothing was too much of a problem we noticed how good the reception and door staff were throughout our stay and this made us feel valued as a guest i wish to mention a certain male who i think was called carlo he was the greatest of helps and always smiley and cheerful it was the little touches he gave like offering an umbrella in the rain showing us directions helping with bags and holding doors open the room itself was nice average sized for london and had everything we needed i have such mixed feelings about this hotel so can only rate it in the middle where they exceeded expectations in some places in others basic standards were not met and we certainly didn t get the hotel that we paid for
