we loved our stay here we only stayed one night of three in london and i wish we had spent every night here the staff was very friendly and helpful we were able to check in early which was really great after a horrible night at a hostel the night before the hotel also had complimentary umbrellas to use which is very useful for rainy weather in london when we come back to london we will stay here and most definitely recommend it to others
