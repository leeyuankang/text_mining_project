excellent value for money the location was fantastic although the room was on a little small side i wouldn t expect any bigger for the money the breakfast was really good the quality of the sausages and bacon were very good and they made our eggs to order which was a nice touch i think this hotel is a hidden gem for those that are economy conscious yet still like high standards
