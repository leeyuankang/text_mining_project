location location location and this hotel is in a great location like most city hotels could do with a bit of tlc in places but it ticked all the big boxes it was clean the bed was comfy the linens fresh and the towels fluffy staff were lovely very helpful breakfast well i guess you had to get up at a decent time for it to be at it s best but we preferred to stay in bed until so what did we expect however even at the eggs were fresh and if not just ask and it will be done the buffet while a little depleted was still plentiful and we didn t have to wait to be seated
