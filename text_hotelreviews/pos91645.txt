the reviews do not do the hotel justice it was welcoming on the outside and reception were welcoming on the inside our room was lovely clean and cosy nice to have coffee and tea facilities as so many don t these days bathroom very clean and plenty of hot water near tube station and ideal location if you are visiting london and want to visit everything
