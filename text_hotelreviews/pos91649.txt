the breakfast was good and the bathroom was big some of the reviews for this hotel are brutal but i didn t have an unpleasant stay either the other guests have been unlucky with their rooms or they were expecting the same standard offered by the hilton on park lane this hotel was fine for the cost and i would stay there again
