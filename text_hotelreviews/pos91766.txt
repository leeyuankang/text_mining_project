the staff did their best but the state of the hotel leaves much to desire the whole place needs renovations the carpets curtains cushions on chairs and couches are stained dirty and smelly the heating does not work the bathroom is in bad shape the tv channels were only partially available in the room for a business hotel expecting to accommodate international guests absolutely not good enough the price for the room night compared with the service bed hygiene quality of food location of the safe non existing minibar and non working phone so we were unable to call room service or the reception but had to go to the lobby to request toiletry that was not replenished and to pick up a bottle of water ourselves is unacceptable again it should be noted that the staff tried hard to get things right management the owner and booking com is to blame for the state of this offer
