the staff especially the reception staff were again extremely pleasant and helpful the left luggage facility is very welcome we always use this hotel since we found it a few years ago as the location suits our needs we really like the ambience of the place and the decor and wouldn t like to see too modern decor as it would lose it s good feeling but we will continue to use this hotel as overall it is a nice hotel
