i had requested a disabled bathroom as i m awaiting hip replacement and it was excellent the staff couldn t have been more helpful and the location is ideal there s a good selection of restaurants close by and i had an excellent evening meal at a lebanese restaurant just round the corner it felt very safe despite being a woman alone the room was well furnished and spacious it was extremely quiet as well i have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
