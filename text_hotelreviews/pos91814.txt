we arrived early and had coffee in the lobby which was great whilst the kind receptionist got one of our rooms ready early this meant we could have a base for our luggage before returning later when the other rooms were ready liked the tea coffee in all rooms which were all very clean location fabulous great to leave the hyde park venue just cross the road to get back loads of restaurants just outside a little tired in places in the corridors but cleanliness location win out
