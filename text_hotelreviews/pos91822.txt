staff very helpful early check in no problem breakfast really good location excellent for getting around london as tube only a six minute walk bars and restaurants within a couples of minutes and a great indian restaurant recommended by keifer sutherland the taj mahal on your door step hyde park is on route to the tube lots going on there if you like people watching and if you like walking we walked from the shard along fleet street through trafalgar square and back to the hotel it took a while but we are years old and it was a bit on the warm side the following day we went to camden market lock nice and easy to get to you really must try this amazing
