the hotel is situated in a quiet backwater just off park lane piccadilly in an area more interesting than either my single room was compact but great value clean quiet with a good bathroom it is excellent value for central london and if like me you are a non business traveller and need a convenient base for an event at one of the larger hotels or clubs without paying a silly amount it s perfect good generous breakfast
