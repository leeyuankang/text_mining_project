the hotel is steeped in history relating to edwardvii and lily langtry and the owners have cleverly merged and preserved the old aspects of the building with a modern hotel eg the entrance dining room bar paintings and staircase the staff on reception were superb polite friendly and very helpful the room was very good clean with plenty of toiletries and tea coffee plus a fridge breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices the hotel is nicely situated close to hyde park and with frequent buses into the central london
