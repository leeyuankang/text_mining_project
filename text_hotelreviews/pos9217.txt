on arrival for our day stay there was an issue with room availability this was not a problem as they provided a room at their sister hotel in kensington for the first night we came back the next day to spend the last days of our london visit here the hotel staff could not have been more helpful or nice and i would like to thank pranav one of the managers at the hotel who looked after us during our stay i highly recommend this hotel and i look forward to my next visit here a great location excellent breakfast and a unique theater bar on the ground floor where the great lillie langtry performed have one of the house cocktails on the stage that lillie graced with her presence
