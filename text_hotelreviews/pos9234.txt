i liked the charm of the traditional styled reception areas our room was furnished in a modern style and it was clean the location of the hotel was great for tube stations bayswater and queensway are really close by attractions like kensington palace hyde park and the royal albert hall were also really close too there is a good selection of restaurants close by for dining out
