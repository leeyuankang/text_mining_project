the hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful the room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms i have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space i found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay at checkout time the staff were politely informed that i could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst i went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from london which was most appreciated overall i had an enjoyable stay at the grand royale london park hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to london
