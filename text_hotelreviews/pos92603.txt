the single room was simple but comfy and clean and quiet looking out on the alley plenty of tea bags and coffee sachets i got extra milk from the bar in the morning i didn t have a drink or meal but the interior of the pub looked inviting staff seemed very friendly and laid back much more character than a cheap chain hotel i would go back especially it was slightly cheaper plenty of buses on the door step
