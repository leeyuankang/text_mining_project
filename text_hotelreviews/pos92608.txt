very convenient location for my needs friendly staff room not luxurious but adequate had all that i needed and was clean and comfortable loved spending time in the bar restaurant and just being able to go upstairs to bed good selection for breakfast but coffee was cold that might be my fault for going down for breakfast at the last minute
