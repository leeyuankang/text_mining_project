you are never sure what you are going to get when booking on the internet but the whole experience has been really good the pub itself has loads of character with friendly staff and a good range of drinks and although i never ate there the food looked really good and the price was reasonable the room was nicely decorated clean and tidy with everything you needed internet worked really well and the tv was a nice addition all in all excellent
