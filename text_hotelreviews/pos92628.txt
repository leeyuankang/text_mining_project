these days when i go to london i want to stay in hackney as my daughter lives there with her boyfriend and this place is virtually just a minute s walk away from her place you can either enter through the pub or through the hotel entrance at the back fairly informal and relaxed atmosphere which is something i personally really like the old ship inn is just around the corner from hackney empire and on mare street or around the back from sylvester path this time around i arrived really late but there was no problem whatsoever for my daughter to pick up the key for me great service stairs were a bit narrow and winding but hey it s the back of a pub and the rooms are on top of that very pub i like it gives it a quaint and personal feel only thing was that i didn t quite know how to get out in the morning but there was a button just slightly beside the door that i didn t see not right at the door but near it anyway this was no biggie and i got out from the staircase and into the pub for breakfast i had a full english breakfast and it was simply to die for no black pudding but still extremely good really good the girl at the counter had some problems understanding english but she did her best and seemed friendly the room was towards the back of the house where there s a rather narrow street which means people residing on the other side of it are able to look into your room should they choose to and vice versa of course i didn t think this was a problem at all as the window was frosted but if you want more privacy creaky floors but to me again it gives it that quaint and personal feeling also shows that it has history once i was awake i could hear the creaking of the hallway as people passed but it really wasn t anything that disturbed me there are far more disturbing noises all around london traffic police cars lorries screaming druggies and drunkards and what have you
