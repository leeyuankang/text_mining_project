i have been staying in london at various different locations and hotels over the last two years and i have to say this has been by far one of my favourites i was somewhat apprehensive about the accommodation being above a pub however there was no noise or music that i could hear from my room the room itself was much more spacious than i had thought and the bed was really comfortable not only was the stay at old ship inn really enjoyable the hospitality of the staff there was amazing they bent over backwards to help me in the morning by printing off some documentation i needed i cannot thank the staff at old ship inn enough for their kindness in the morning i was made a full english breakfast which was delicious all in all a really enjoyable experience thank you old ship inn
