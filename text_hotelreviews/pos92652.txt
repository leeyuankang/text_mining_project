the old ship is something of an experience the entrance to the hotel is via a shabby door in a dark alley behind the hackney empire then down a narrow passage behind the bar which is the main business of the premises there are only about hotel rooms up a rather dirty stairway with built in creaks and into the room which given the build up was a pleasant surprise quite large comfortable and clean quiet and with reasonable bathroom and facilities the staff from the bar were pleasant and helpful the food is ok if you like burgers
