the customer service at reception and the restaurant were good great selection of refreshments in the room from teas and fancy pods for the coffee machine the mini fridge for the small pint of fresh milk was an adorable touch the quirky decor definitely lived up to the description on the booking page lovely view from my room of the big beer garden unfortunately it was raining heavily when i stayed so i couldn t visit
