the staff were incredible at this hotel very friendly courteous and helpful i do feel however due to the price of the room i expected a little more stayed in the lavender suite which was lovely however does need a little upgrading e g crack in bathroom sink slight fraying on carpet tiles in shower area look tired they are only small details but i do think these things could be looked at and improved
