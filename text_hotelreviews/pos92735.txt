rooms were well equipped and comfortable there was good soundproofing so we weren t disturbed by the thunder storms or traffic it was good to find a dog friendly hotel in london the location was good and right next to west ealing station which would have been useful had we needed to go into central london our boys enjoyed playing on the table tennis table in the back garden
