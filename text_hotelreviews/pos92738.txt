it s a pub with rooms nice pub with a lovely garden and a friendly ambience good value for london the food looked nice but we didn t eat there as we were going to a party staff friendly room was compact but had nice bathroom and also good tea teapigs and coffee nepresso and real milk impressed bed very comfy it was a hot night so we had to open a window and thought it would be noisy but actually it wasn t would definitely recommend if you want to stay in west ealing at a reasonable price and in somewhere nicer than a travelodge
