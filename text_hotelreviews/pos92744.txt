the daytime menu was good being able to order several starter plates to share at a slightly better rate and the food was good quality nice selection of drinks there too and nice atmosphere in the bar very busy bustling place i didn t expect to have aircon in the room and i would say that it was quiet and most welcome too as the room was hot when we walked in
