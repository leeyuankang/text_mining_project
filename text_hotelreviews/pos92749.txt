coffee machine garden terrace the food in restaurant was mixed the steak pie was excellent and piping hot but the sweet potato curry was hardly a curry just potato with maybe a bit of curry powder served luke warm the fish and chips looked great though so maybe one bad choice we would stay at this hotel again if in the area
