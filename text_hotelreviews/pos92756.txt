i really like the fact that the hotel it self does not look promising from the outside just a regular accomodation house with a pub in it however you can be nicely suprised once inside i ve been to a few hotels in my like and this one trull made a really good impression room was very spacious and well equiped coffee maker with coffee biscuts to go with it very clean toilet definately strong out of on top of it all amazingly good value for money will definately visit again
