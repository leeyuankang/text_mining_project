everything was great here from reception service to the standard of the room which was quietly luxurious plus the great pub bar downstairs who do a mean black pudding scotch egg great wines beers to choose from again really friendly staff and the complimentary breakfast in the morning was not only continental buffet style but a cooked brunch style coffee on top perfect thanks
