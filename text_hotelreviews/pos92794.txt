comfortable bed room had all the essentials you might need and was very clean and tidy lovely staff who allowed us to leave our car when arriving early in the morning and also to leave the car the following day after check in so we could head in to london again very close to the central line about minute walk which was brilliant and then only mins in to town from there central line also on the night tube service so runs all night on the weekend would definitely recommend staying here parking was also especially handy
