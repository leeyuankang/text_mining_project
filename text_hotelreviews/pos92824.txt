rooms were very clean could have been doing with air con or even a fan as it was very warm when we stayed bathroom was very spacious but the heat coming from lights round mirror was unbearable they were needed when using the sink for shaving or putting on make up as single iight was not bright enough the bottle containing the water did not seal tight enough was also warm and the milk in thermos was off when we went to use it perhaps a fridge would rectify these problems
