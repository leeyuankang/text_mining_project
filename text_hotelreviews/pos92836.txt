despite being a busy pub restaurant establishment as well as a hotel the rooms were very quiet mine even looked out over the busy garden area and i got no noise travelling up i actually liked that it was at the opposite end of uxbridge rd to the main area of ealing broadway it avoided the noise of that main road from cars and sirens fire and police stations are there which could easily be heard in one of the other hotels along that main stretch of road apparently
