definitely a hidden gem of a hotel worthy of its star rating sumptuous if not a little small rooms fitted out to a high standard and boasting very good quality toiletries clean and comfortable fantastic towels the pub downstairs is lively and social with a decent menu there is also a drawing room if you want a bit more peace and quiet location puts it only minutes into paddington on the train
