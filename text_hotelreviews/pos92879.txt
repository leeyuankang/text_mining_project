the room was spacious and clean the beds very comfortable and facilities were very good the rooms look luxurious and are very well maintained although we didn t use the breakfast facilities or got in touch with the hotel staff a lot the staff we did speak to were very friendly and professional there is a train station next to the hotel but we preferred to walk to the nearest tube station which was a minutes walk away there runs a bus too so the hotel is easy to reach so far the best hotel i have stayed in in london
