we stayed here because it was close to our daughter s flat and convenient to get into central london we got a bus to ealing broadway then the tube into the city west ealing station is very close too it took about an hour the staff were very friendly and the room was comfortable if a little small we paid extra for breakfast and it was very nice there was a free car park which saves a fortune in london
