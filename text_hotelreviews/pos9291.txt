great hotel in terms of staff food and ambience in the communal areas fantastically located a few minutes walk to two tube stations seconds from kensington gardens and only walk or tube ride to paddington and trains to heathrow the west country and south wales the grande royale is also reasonably priced and comfortable for the area
