anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there location of the hotel is about from the nearest metro station the rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in however there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion
