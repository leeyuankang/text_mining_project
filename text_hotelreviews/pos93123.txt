the staff were amazing from the moment we arrived we were greeted with a drink then upgraded to a stunning room and a bottle of fizz and goodies delivered the day i was almost tempted to ignore the sights of our capital city and just stay in the hotel the club lounge is an added bonus tand we enjoyed the surprisingly varied continental breakfast
