loved that the hotel leaves a mobile telephone in the room that you can take outside with u and use for calls internet google maps etc this was extremely useful because general wifi availability outside the hotel was poor loved the club room too most days we had breakfast there was quiet and coffee and the small selection of food available were excellent
