upon arrival we were offered drinks and fruit when the staff was checking us in when we arrived at the room we found cake and a bottle of wine waiting for us we arrived so late and were still trying to adjust to jet lag so unfortunately we didn t really get to enjoy of that wine we have been properly looked after during our day stay the spa facility at the hotel is great but needs some upgrade the restaurant within the hotel cooked us a fantastic course meal for dinner and that exceeded out expectation the spa treatments and the spa room were really good we did a couple message at the spa and we were offered drinks and biscuits and we truly enjoyed those hours together everything was fantastic the room was serviced twice everyday location is great
