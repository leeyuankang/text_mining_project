this was the second time i ve stayed at this hotel and i really love it it s super comfortable the staff are friendly the property is nicely decorated and maintained i am especially happy the hotel is very quiet and tucked away i found it extremely convenient with the tube being right around the corner along with all the shops on oxford street
