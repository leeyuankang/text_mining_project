the location of the hotel was very convenient for our touristic visit the tube was mins away as well as hyde park and mins away from selfridges the building itself was in a quiet surrounding away from the busy oxford street breakfast was good good variety of food and also good service fruits are brough everyday and fresh newspapers too staff was friendly after our complaints they made it up to us which is a very kind gesture of their duty manager much appreciated overall we had more of a good experience in this hotel
