the staff are extremely helpful and friendly location is excellent within walking distance to anything you need free fruits and water upon arrival which is a nice touch relatively easy to get a taxi the doormen are more than happy to help you fetch one if there s non in front of the property door last but not least the mobile with internet free calls is great for travelers as well though i didnt use it as i ve got a local phone still think it s a good touch overall an excellent experience and would recommend to anyone
