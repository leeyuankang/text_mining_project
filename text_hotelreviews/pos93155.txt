the location is excellent a stone s throw from marble arch and easy walking distance to oxford street shops and to hyde park all staff were friendly and welcoming including the doormen who gave a friendly hello every time we went out or came back we were staying as a surprise for my husband s birthday and the guest experience executive in charge of our stay izabela went out of her way to add extra touches to make our stay extra special the bed was so comfy too would thoroughly recommend this hotel
