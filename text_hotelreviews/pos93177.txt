the hotel is fantastic it is very luxurious elegant and relaxing my stay was for my wedding anniversary and the icing on the cake was when our room got upgraded free upon arrival the park place suite was amazing very spacious and relaxing the shower and bath areas were of very high quality and opulence they also had a very powerful power shower which the missus loved there was complementary bubbly provided with some chocolate covered strawberries fruits and water the setting was very romantic indeed and appreciated by both of us staff were attentive and very responsive i had breakfast in bed but the pastries were missed i rang up reception and a nice selection was brought up immediately i would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a nice relaxing stay with extravagant room features particularly the bathrooms available to us and you get looked after by moncalm staff cant wait to try the spa and gym the next time i stay thanks to all the staff at montcalm
