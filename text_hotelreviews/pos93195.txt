every thing was beyond expectation i mean i have been in london before i usualy stay for a one week vacation each hotel i used to stay in has got a one or two bad points but here in the montcalm hotel marble arch what ever you dream about they make it come true starting from the reception especialy izabella i am going to miss her smile and her effort for trying to make my accommodation comfort and elite she decorate my room especialy for my birthday she upgraded me to a junior suit without asking a free acess to the lounge they made me feel like i am the only resident in the hotel and that was the very special thing about them the hotel was fully booked and they make you feel like you is the only resident they have i loved the bathroom so much i loved the bed and pillows it was very comfy the room was very nice and clean they clean the bathroom and replace towels and clean room like twice or more every day yes that is true amazing and izabella every time she stops me and try to make you ask for any thing to make it come true as you wish for your comfy accomodation next time before i will book a room i will make first sure that izabella is there
