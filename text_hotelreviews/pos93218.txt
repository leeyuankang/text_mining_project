serious luxury we were attended to as though we were royalty the room was massive and had turn down service nightly we had access to a happy hour in the club lounge and a beautiful breakfast was included each morning the spa and gym were top notch and the staff was extra sweet to my yo son it s also an awesome location tucked into a quiet residential street but only a two minute walk to trains buses and bustling oxford st we love this place we will be back
