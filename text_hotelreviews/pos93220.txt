very attentive and friendly staff great facilities they realised it was my birthday and made a fuss of me complimentary pastries and proseco which was a real treat they also supplied filter coffee at our request quite expensive compared to our usual hotels but then it was star we didn t have breakfast there as our supply of fruit and biscuits was enough
