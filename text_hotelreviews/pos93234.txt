amazing hotel with fantastic staff loved all the little touches that the staff did for example we arrived a little before check in but staff were so accommodating and made us coffee while they sorted room on returning to the room after a long evening out it was lovely to return to a turned down bed lavender on our pillows slippers etc breakfast was superb and throughout the whole stay every staff member we met was polite and helpful we would highly recommend this hotel and will be back soon enough
