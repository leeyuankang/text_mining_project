i travel a lot on business the most important factors while choosing a hotel for myself are location lack of noise comfort i have no complaints my room was comfortable spacious spotless i could concentrate on my work as there was hardly any noise nespresso coffee machine was an extra bonus i could watch tv through the glass wall while having a bath excellent location hidden away but at the same time very close to the shops hyde park tube station i highly recommend this hotel
