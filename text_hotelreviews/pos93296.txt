the montcalm is an extremely luxurious hotel in an excellent location with staff who go out of their way to assist you a staff member even located for us the culture section that had been missing from the previous day s newspaper our room was beautifully furnished and had all the desired amenities and a very comfortable bed despite being in the center of london we were able to get a good night s rest the breakfast buffet was first rate with a great variety of choice highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay
