it was my stay in this hotel the first room they gave me was a bit different in terms of cleanliness compare to previous times they made it to me and upgraded me to a bigger room with more facilities it was a suit but again i think this is the time to change some furniture as some get old and even cleaning dosent help the perfect new thing in this stay was the handy which was a phone with unlimited internet and free local calls the lounge is always relaxing and supper clean and i enjoy it to do some work there the point is computers need an upgrade but what makes you to go back to this hotel is defiantly staff and managmnet they can t be more helpful and carring
