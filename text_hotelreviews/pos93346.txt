me and my husband had stayed here before many years ago and decided to stay again when we went to our room we realised it wasn t the same as the one we had previously stayed in the concierge ring you minutes or so after check in to make sure everything is ok with your room we mentioned that it wasn t the same they found out what room we visited before and moved us straight away to a junior suite for free would highly recommend this hotel amazing location for shopping and superb restaurants we have stayed in other hotels in london but now we have revisited the montcalm we won t go anywhere else
