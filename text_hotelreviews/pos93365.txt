this is how a luxury star hotel should look like royal treat and fine touches for a special occasion we had a free upgrade and welcoming amenities location cannot be better in london mins walk to marble arch snd hyde park breakfast is delicious and fresh i warmly recommend this hotel and will sure be back whenever i visit london
