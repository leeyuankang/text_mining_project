i loved the hotel and the staff it was very welcome and friendly with good hospitality the room was fantastic and i would say this is diffo up there with the mgm grand las vegas hotel room the room was big and the bathroom room is awesome the location was also a bonus with the restaurants and shops on your door step the parking is a good bonus to only for hours but the parking is free on sunday s
