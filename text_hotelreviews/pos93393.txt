a remarkable gem in a great location in london we have stayed in quite a few central london hotels but this was one of the most memorable and faultless hotel stays we have had the service room breakfast and facilities were all excellent at reception angeline was extremely welcoming and accommodating we were given a surprise upgrade to the royal suite which made my husband s birthday celebrations extra special we absolutely loved the four poster bed with its fibre optic lights simulating the night sky and the deep jacuzzi bathtub with its mood lighting and the lounge access just made the stay wonderful a truly special stay we highly recommend the montcalm we will definitely be coming back
