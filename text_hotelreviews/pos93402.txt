everything the staff at the reception was extremely kind offering me an upgrade and taking care of all the details the location of the hotel was great nearby marble arch and even though the sourrounding streets were quite and silent the room very comfortable clean with fruit and all the facilities the montcalm is definitely the best option to accommodate in london i will come back again for sure
