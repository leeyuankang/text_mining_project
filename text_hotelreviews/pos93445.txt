i am returning guest to the hotel i liked the hotel from my first stay indeed this stay was different though i found a lot of new staff members from my previous stays they used to have in the system my preferences but this time there was none in the profiles i preferred higher floor but my room this time was at floor with very small window to the back yard where there was some sort of generator which was loudly operated through the night for some reason
