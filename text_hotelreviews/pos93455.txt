the staff simply can t do enough for you they are all so helpful and responsive such a pleasant change from some of the hotels i have stayed at recently the location of the hotel is surprisingly quiet and peaceful given that it is in the centre of london it is also great for access to the west end my room a club room although small was quite comfortable and was very clean
