the staff is great when we got to the hotel we were asked to pay in advance and when we got to the room to our surprise coincidence or not there was no water we complained to the manager and the lady was very polite and upgraded our room gave us access to the business club and free breakfast for the rest of our stay that s how you solve a problem thank you
