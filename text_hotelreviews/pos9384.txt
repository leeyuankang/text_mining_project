the hotel itself is very grand traditional and looks fantastic the deluxe room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with great facilities the staff are friendly and dressed as grand as the hotel is the location is perfect for tourists being a second walk from kensington gardens and a couple minutes away from the nearest tube
