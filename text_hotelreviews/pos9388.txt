i actually live round the corner from this hotel and booked it as a birthday surprise for my sister and her fiance as a romantic break and a great way for us to catch up easily the following day not only did i book it at a greatly discounted price but they were so lovely to upgrade the couple to the beautiful lilly langtry suite my sister adores poster beds and the only way to describe the suite is as magnificent and they also provided complimentary wine chocolates and a fruit basket they let me know the next day that the bar staff were also truly phenomenal friendly service as well as front of house with opulent decor and great drink prices i book and stay in a lot of hotels as an event planner and most definitely will be recommending this one to everyone and making sure that i get to stay myself one day soon
