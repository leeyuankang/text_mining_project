the room had been recently renovated in a modern style we found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the victorian style of the public areas these were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings the one way street was residential with large well maintained victorian houses now mostly flats it was very quiet a range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a circle line underground station it was easy to travel to the theatre via the circle line we had booked room only so cannot comment on the food
