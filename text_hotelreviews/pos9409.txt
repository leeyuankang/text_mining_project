the hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall the entire experience was great the staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us i loved that personal touch yes central london is very expensive and the rooms aren t big but it s central london and when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters the toilet even had a bath tub which was great a great experience and its just on the other side of the queensway station a min walk and has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage totally worth it i recommend it strongly
