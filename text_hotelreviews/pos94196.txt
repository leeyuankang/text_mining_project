i love the hotel decor staying in london i wanted to stay in a hotel that had the antique style and feel to it and this hotel does was perfect for that it is in a beautiful suburb with little local shops near by and a min walk to the warwick street tube station so after sightseeing all day you just get of the tube and you are at the hotel the best thing of all was the phone they provide in all the rooms you can make local calls book tickets and tours etc and best of all use google maps to get around we never got lost once it was free and we took it everywhere with us overall really liked the hotel
