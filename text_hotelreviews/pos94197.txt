i loved the decor and the location express train from the airport to paddington station then change lines to the barkerloo line and it s only one stop away to warrick avenue station when you come up from the underground it s about meters away so after a long day of sightseeing it s great to get on a train then not have to walk far a beautiful suburb with lovely looking houses all around
