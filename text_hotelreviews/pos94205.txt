after i ve been told that there was no room for me double bed room even though i ve made the booking approx months before one certain receptionist italian guy put all his effort to find a solution for that issue in the end we agreed to get me a junior suit room for my night during my stay the night i had to stay in some sort of cabin room it was very little space very narrow with a bunk bed very tiny windows in total like being in a submarine and a total joke for a star hotel and one free breakfast since the hotel didn t want to give me a refund read the whole story up but that receptionist tried in the end his best to help me out very good location the staff was in general nice and friendly comfortable beds even the one in my cabin room breakfast was ok english breakfast is not really famous but the quality was ok very lovely lobby british style internet worked unusually fine for a hotel
