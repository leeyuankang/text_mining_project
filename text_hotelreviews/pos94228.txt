the first room we were put in smelt like death no exaggeration it was coming from the bathroom we were eventually moved to a supposedly upgraded room tired decor paper thin walls and celings ment we could hear every movement the the bed was so small there were no tea or coffee making facilties in the room although the welcome book stated there was there was pug socket in the whole room which proved fun with phones requiring overnight charging hotel is run down and outdated i have no idea where they got stars from staff were lovely however if there was a travel lodge free nearby i woukd have rather stayed there
