i booked way in advance and got a great deal and the cancellation option the room was small but looked lovely next to reception and the lounge area i know some of the other rooms would be bigger but unless you are paying for a suite this was as expected they kept our bags safe for us when we went off for the day nice touches included offering us iced water nothing much you may think but more than larger chain hotels comfy bed good nights sleep didn t eat in the restaurant but it looked lovely and matched the standard of the hotel appearance overall the staff were friendly and helpful not pretentious
