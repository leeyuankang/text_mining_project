nice location the bed was comfortable the room was inviting the view of the london eye was generally unobstructed the towels were huge and warmed the staff was very friendly when personnel realized that my friend and i would be returning from the theater too late to get dinner they let us place our dinner order before leaving for the theater and prepared it for us upon our return to the hotel even though the restaurant was closed for the evening
