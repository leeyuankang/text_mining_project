we had an amazing stay at this hotel with breath taking views of the london eye river thames and other land marks such as st paul s cathedral and the gherkin our room was this hotel is brilliantly situated and we will definitely be re using this hotel every time we go to london everything is in walking distance or very easy public transport routes
