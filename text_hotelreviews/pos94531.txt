we stayed for a weekend in the deluxe room with river view on the floor this room costs extra but it was worth every penny the view is amazing day and night you have an excellent view of the thames the london eye and the skyline of the city the room itself was wonderful definitely recommended staff was very friendly and room service was excellent
