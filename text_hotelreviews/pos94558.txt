it s located one block off of the main street there is a tube station within a minute walk very close to big ben london eye is across the water the rooms are clean location is great easy access to tube very safe area i would stay here again and not go to the bar service at the bar was very slow i didn t appreciate the bar tender serving male clients first before me even though i was first to ask for a drink happened again for the bill i wish i remembered the bartender s name he asked me my ethnicity he seemed to be of a spanish speaking country i would have given the hotel a high rating on the staff if it wasn t for their chauvinistic bartender other than that all the other staff was great
