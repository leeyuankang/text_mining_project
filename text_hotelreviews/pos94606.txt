standard of the room was very good however dinner was a disappointment as the steak was far too rare as it was ordered medium well we waited for a member of staff but there was no one around so we left without finishing the meal also although the selection was good at breakfast i would expect for the price to have it cooked to order and not served buffet style dried out bacon to conclude i would stay at the hotel again as the location and room were exceptional however i wouldn t eat there again including breakfast
