the staff were superb and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived they were professional without being stuffy and took note of our requests on the booking we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts which provided a superb range from fully cooked english breakfast to a wonderful array of fruit breads and cold meats and cheeses the location was perfect for exploring the london sites and we would definitely stay again
