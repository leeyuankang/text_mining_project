i love the fabulous location of this hotel and its oldy worldy feel thank you for the unexpected upgrade to a suite which made for a very luxurious stay indeed and suited my purposes of using the hotel as my base for catching up various old friends in london the separate lounge area below the mezzanine bedroom allowed for the perfect location to host friends either for a meal or cocktails the staff were extremely helpful in providing the extra stemware needed loved the luxury of the room with the magnificent views both in the evenings with the lights over the thames and the early morning spectacular sunrises loved the spa bath and tv and luxury bath products the nespresso coffee machine was a wonderful perk looking forward to my next opportunity to stay thanks again to all who made my stay such a memorable one
