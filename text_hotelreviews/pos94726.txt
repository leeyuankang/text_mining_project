the royal horseguards is a gorgeous hotel which we booked for its proximity to the playhouse theatre just across the street where we saw the play the hotel has a very grand impressive lobby with helpful doormen waiting to assist outside and the most beautiful older building right next door one whitehall place adjoins the hotel reception area leads to a stunning marble staircase with decorative tiles from a glamorous bygone age in various beautiful ante rooms for entertaining and historic portraits harking back to it s liberal party past from top to bottom it s absolutely stunning horseguards staff were terrific from reception to restaurant to house keeping everyone was super friendly always smiling we were upgraded to a deluxe room on arrival as our standard room wasn t yet ready for us this was a very welcome considerate gesture as we were mindful not to be late for the theatre the room was perfect everything you d expect of a high end hotel great bathroom big comfortable bed no complaints at all very grateful for the upgrade breakfast was great huge selection from salmon healthier options lots of fruit and of course a full english if that s your poison we left our bags with the concierge after checking out all fuss free easy as can be they even offered us a glass of champagne upon departure a sure fire way of ensuring a return visit highly recommended
