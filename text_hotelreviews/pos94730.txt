a very warm welcome and the staff were great in showing us to the room and attending to our luggage when checking in we were asked if it was a trip for any special reason it was my wife s birthday the day we checked in and our wedding anniversary the day we checked out on returning to our room in the evening of our arrival we were delighted to find a birthday card with special chocolates on a slate with happy birthday written in icing sugar and a bottle of bubbly on ice a most thoughtful gesture even the fire alarm going off on sunday morning and the evacuation of the hotel was carried out calmly and with great speed and courtesy by all the staff
