loved the hotel and room the majority of the staff were very helpful however a couple of the younger chaps on concierge didn t seem up to speed with the service expected no assistance with luggage on the way in and the car parking system leaves a lot to be desired having booked the hotel expecting on site parking i was disappointed to have to park my own car then deal with the logistics of the luggage
