we felt that we were well looked after by the reception team dining staff and concierges the rooms were superb with extremely comfortable beds which gave us a good nights sleep chocolates on the beds when they had been turned down and the slippers put ready was a lovely touch with ambient lighting when returning to our room in the evening breakfast was amazing with plenty to choose from at the buffet all in all a wonderful stay we hope to return
