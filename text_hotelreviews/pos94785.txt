before we left i messaged the hotel to ask for a room with a view as it was my husband s birthday we booked an executive room which was wonderful it was clean spacious and luxurious with a view of the thames and london eye it was surprisingly quiet given that the london traffic never seems to stop we also had the lovely surprise of a box of chocolates and a hand written postcard of the royal horseguard hotel wishing my husband a happy birthday at a home away from home which was genuinely what it felt like such a thoughtful touch staff were happy to store our luggage for us both before check in and after our departure at no extra cost we were told we could leave it with them for up to six weeks breakfast was included and it was fit for a king you can even have it brought to your room for a surcharge everything was within an easy walking distance we didn t need to use london transport at all and we went to trafalgar square covent garden leicester square london eye etc etc i can honestly say that this has been our best hotel stay yet and we would definitely return
