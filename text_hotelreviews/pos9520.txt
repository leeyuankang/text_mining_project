this hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt the staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it the problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other one had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room if you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room also in staying days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied
