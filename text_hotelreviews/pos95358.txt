the location was excellent for our needs and for a central london hotel it was very quiet at night even with the windows open i liked the way the duty manager was helpful when we complained about the room description and in fairness it seems it wasn t the hotel s fault but booking com they offered us a free drink and breakfast on the sunday which was very much appreciated
