very pleasantly surprised at how good our room was for the low rate paid we just needed somewhere to crash after a concert in hyde park and this was perfect for our needs fitzrovia is a nice part of london plenty of independent restaurants and cafes nearby minutes walk to hyde park and a much shorter walk to the shopping in oxford street
