while not centrally located and may not be ideal for tourists it was convenient to my meeting venues especially to riba which is just two blocks away the great portland tube is just a minute walk from the hotel there is a sainsbury around the corner and there are a lot of cafes and delis the hotel comes with an a c and a small electric fan which are very useful in the summer
