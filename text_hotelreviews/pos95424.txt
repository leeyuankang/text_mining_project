the hotel was in an ideal position for us as we travelled by train to euston and walked to the hotel our room was very nice with a large bathroom and it was spotlessly clean we had one meal in the restaurant which was good and the waitress was extremely friendly and efficient in fact we found all the staff to be helpful and courteous
