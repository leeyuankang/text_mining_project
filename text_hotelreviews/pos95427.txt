this hotel is just great perfect location min walk from the great portland street station and about min walk from the oxford street best part of the room was the bed we slept extremely well and lining was really nice i would definitely come back we have not tried the breakfast so can t say about that but there are lot of restaurants and coffee shops next to the hotel if you decide to have no breakfast at the hotel
