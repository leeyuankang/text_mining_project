the price was very good and the location fantastic for getting to the london palladium which we needed the bar was really good and the food we had after our night out was very welcome didn t try breakfast but the sandwich we had at midnight was tasty the hotel was quiet and the sleep was comfortable could just do with some air con as it was a warm evening the staff were lovely and attentive and made the checking in easy and explained about the facilities i would definitely go back again as the hotel was very nice and i enjoyed my stay
