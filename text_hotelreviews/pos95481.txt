i have stayed here before and was very impressed withe the hotel and location sadly this time the room was much smaller despite an apparent upgrade and very hot even with the windows open also despite asking for a quiet room i was right outside drilling which started at about on a saturday morning so no sleep after that staff are great and very helpful and it was very good value for a london hotel just wish i d had the same huge room as last time and big windows out to the street
