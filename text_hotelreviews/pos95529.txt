overnight stay in london location good near oxford street and from there you can access tourist parts of london etc also in a quiet area did not eat at hotel as there are so many places to eat out comfort of bed was excellent and for a london hotel the the room was a good size with a bath and overhead shower would definitelty book this hotel again if in london
