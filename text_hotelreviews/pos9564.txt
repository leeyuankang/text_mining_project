staff were superb we didn t meet a bad person all week lots of choice for breakfast the room was more than adequate for our needs if i m a bit picky a spruce up with a paint brush wouldn t have gone a miss and we loved the building the location was spot on for us too and would like to stay at this hotel for all of our london visits in the years to come thank you
