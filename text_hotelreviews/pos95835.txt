if you ve been to paris before this is a good place to stay while it s not walking close to the attractions it s in a charming part of the city center with restaurants local patrons and hang out places it s close to the metro two different stops approximately minutes max walking it s also close to a great spot to get a view of the city from up high we had a minor hiccup in our arrival time and the staff were very accommodating and understanding to our needs our connecting room was perfect as it had a main door and hallway to two little doors loved the quiet bar area where the host tried to make us whatever we wanted very adorable
