closely located to the pais montparnasse train station good location for trains to outer france and on a street full of eateries i had room that had its own sit outside balcony that added to the roominess of what is otherwise like many other quaint paris hotels a smallish room however it had everything and was quaintly and tastefully decorated good value a reasonable walk to the eiffel tower and tourist sights breakfast to am was wonderful staff all spoke good english were quite helpful when asked
