the location was awesome it felt like we stayed amongst locals as part of the neighborhood and not in a tourist zone the hotel had great restaurants and cafes just across the street and a grocery store pharmacy and metro access down the block very convenient on saturday the block by the metro station became a local food market and art gallery selling and showcasing all kinds of good things the staff was very helpful especially tega i hope that s how it s spelled forgive he answered all of my friend s incessant questioning and provided expert guidance on where to go and how to get there bravo
