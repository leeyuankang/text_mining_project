we arrived early in the morning and did not expect our room to be ready but there was a room that was ready we were able to check in unpack and go in and out as we pleased during the day this was the best feature of our stay which was otherwise fine the main reason we chose the hotel was its proximity to the gare montparnasse where we needed to be the next day the hotel is very close to the station
