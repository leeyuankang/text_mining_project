the staff were very friendly and helpful the room is not big but not small by london standard either it s a little far away from any tube station but a very pleasant walk along the high fashion sloan street as long as the weather is not too bad seems always some taxi waiting at the gate so not a problem at all for those don t plan to use public transportation walking distance to some of the a list museums
