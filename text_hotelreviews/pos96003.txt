everything in the hotel was very high quality completely loved using the little gym that they had the coffee was great and the breakfast porridge was even better the rooms are amazing not too big but still big for london standards my favorite was the shower very high quality and even the beds are big and comfortable staff are always super friendly and really it made my stay in london so much better than the usual the area is great very nice walk to sloane square knightsbridge and even vauxhall station kings road etc
