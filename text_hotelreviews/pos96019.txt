let me put it this way there isn t anything i didn t like about the property apart from it being slightly pricey i didn t mind paying due to the hospitality service location the layout of the hotel it s small but yet luxurious and extremely comfortable you never wait in line it s almost a private stay because no body bothers you the staff are extremely helpful and pay attention to detail i felt very comfortable and bed is heaven so comfortable i would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to explore london because it s perfectly located near the main attractions walking distance to harrods and hyde park the tube was only mins away anyways there are loads of restaurants and shisha places near the hotel as well don t take a taxi with the taxi that was expensive they wanted to charge me and i took an uber which cost me so definitely take an uber also an uber to soho and oxford street cost me around which isn t a lot at all especially if it s raining
