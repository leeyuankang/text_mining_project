extremely welcoming helpful and friendly staff the reception staff greeted me by name when i would return to the hotel in the evenings they managed to get my suit steamed and shirts pressed and both returned within a matter of hours on a sunday i would have never imagined this possible the room was quite large for a hotel in the city centre and the bed was extremely comfortable nice view of the square across the street the location was amazing just a couple of minutes walk to the knightsbridge tube station a lovely walk along sloane street with its luxury boutiques on either side i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a truly exceptional stay in london
