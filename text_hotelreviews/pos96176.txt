the location of the hotel is perfect my room had a bay window overlooking the square gardens and the tree tops and i loved looking out of the window in the morning the staff were exceptionally helpful especially the spanish bell boy who sorted out everything from a room change to extra lighting smiles and hellos all around the bar is very relaxed and is beautifully decorated the food there and in the restaurant is very very good
