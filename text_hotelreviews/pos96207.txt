so quirky and fantastic felt very personalised and nice to know that everyone has the same sized room was like something out of the hunger games the rooms are small but the bed is big enough for four comfortably if you ask me the shower is incredible and the mood lighting is awesome had a great time at this hotel and my sister agrees with me when we say we would definitely stay here again
