the main purpose of my trip was to visit an exhibition at tate modern and this hotel couldn t be more conveniently placed there was plenty more to do that side of the river including visits to the shard borough market and the clink museum but with a bus stop just outside the hotel it was also very easy to get to the west end to watch a show
