this hotel was in an excellent position with easy walking distance to the southbank and all that it offers the venue itself was modern and well thought out with access to all that you would require and zoned areas for sitting the bar is positioned for easy access to enjoy the atmosphere the staff were all extremely friendly polite and helpful i could not fault them we were able to store our bags in a safe area whilst we enjoyed the rest of our trip to collect later before heading home the room was clean and controlled by ipad very easy to use our room was a quite room and the bed took up the entire end of the room so very large and comfortable but not so easy access for both parties depending on how agile you are we enjoyed our stay very much and i would recommend and hopefully use again
