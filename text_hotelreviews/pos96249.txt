the whole experience was very positive and very straightforward the staff in all areas were very friendly and helpful the hotel is very cool with an amazing decor it is all very modern the rooms are quite small but they have thought of everything the hooks and shelves switches and plug sockets are all in the perfect spot so the designs of the room have been very well thought out the bed was extremely comfortable we had a very good stay also the location is excellent you slap bang in between waterloo southwark and london bridge station all around a min walk and minutes from southbank there are also loads of bars and restaurants in close proximity as well as borough market
