we were transferred to their sister hotel the shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel we were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out we were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely the hotel is very close to both bayswater and queensway tube stations and to hyde park
