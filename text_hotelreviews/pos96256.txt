the staff were wonderful and made you feel like a vip we loved the quirkiness of the hotel there were roses left in our bedroom when we got back the first day with a little note to tell us we were the sweetest guests nice bit of pr very close to the tate gallery and the thames the bed was comfortable and the fridge was full of goodies the towels were so thick and soft we will definitely stay at this unusual hotel again thank you for looking after us so well
