i stayed for a long weekend i loved the concept and design of the hotel the room was rather small but everything was available the staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel is located in a nice quite neighborhood with some restaurants around and not far from the tourist attractions i walked to most of the places or to westminster to take the hop on hop off bus i really had a very enjoyable stay
