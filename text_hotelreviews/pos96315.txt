the hotel is completely unique never been to a hotel like it before although the rooms were small they were big enough for the of us without getting under each others feet the added bonus of the free drinks were great after travelling all morning the last thing i wanted was to have to find a drink or carry one up from the bar with luggage the staff were all really friendly and went above and beyond to help us with our stay the movies included were also brilliant for ending a long day we did have breakfast here there was a good selection of hot and cold items which helped to kick start our day
