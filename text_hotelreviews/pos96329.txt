i have to say i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the citizenm i had never stayed there before and they kind of blew me away with their kind of co working space and cafe with hotel rooms concept it was seriously comfortable the staff were lovely and the rooms while small and some sort of capsule version of living in a space station lol were very well appointed seriously comfortable and could have everything you could ask for i really really liked it problems in my room were dealt with promptly and efficiently and i thought the staff were top notch my general impression of london hotels is of getting ripped off and paying through the nose for a not so great stay citizenm kinda changed my mind about staying in london definitely my new go to hotel when forced to stay in ol blighty location next to the tate and some of the great dining of bankside also quite appreciated nb i had a deep discount on the room so thought it was quit the value for money not sure how i d feel about their standard rack rate
