the room was very comfortable and clean minimalist in size but i expected that from the info given on the website i felt the space was well used the room was great fun i enjoyed changing the colours of the lights in the bathroom wonderful lounge and breakfast tea and coffee also i asked staff to put a note saying happy birthday peter in our room as a surprise for my husband they put up lots of greetings and pictures and left a little pastry with a candle it was a lovely generous touch thank you i would love to stay again
