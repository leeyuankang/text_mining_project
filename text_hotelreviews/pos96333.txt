we loved our stay the room was a bit snug but that was well communicated during the booking process so that was no surprise the bed was huge and incredibly comfortable something i really valued after an exhausting first leg of my trip the property was very cool and modern and incorporated technology into the function of the room we loved having the ipad controls
