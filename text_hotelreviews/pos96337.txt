staff were really nice and the rooms while small and capsule esque were surprisingly and fully appointed with free movies free minbars etc it takes a second to get used to since it feels like you re living in a future space station in the rooms but it gets surprisingly comfy quick quite the fan now after staying there oh and loved the co working space esque living room and bar ver comfy to get real work done while there
