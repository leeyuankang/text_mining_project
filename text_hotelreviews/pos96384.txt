the staff were very friendly and helpful with our being first timers at this hotel the self service check in could have been daunting but a member of staff was there to guide us through the hotel has a great sense of style and a good buzz from all age groups the hour bar cafe is a great plus and has many areas so you can have privacy or be amongst people if you choose
