after some unfortunate technical difficulties with the automated check in and then the i pad room controls created an initial negative impact upon tired travelers the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly and the rooms and super large bed was lovely the bar area downstairs is a great place to relax or enjoy a drink but does get very busy during the mornings
