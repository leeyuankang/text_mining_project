we loved the look and feel of this hotel not the normal interior design and style but really had that hugge feel beautiful location ideal for us great room with comfy bed and gorgeous soft egyptian cotton towels didn t mind not having a kettle in the room the coffee from mcanteen was divine and worth the walk downstairs to purchase
