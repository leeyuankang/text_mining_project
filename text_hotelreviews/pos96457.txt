it seemed that every effort had been made to make a classy experience at an affordable price we really enjoyed the staff gui and esther were wonderful the atmosphere and the room usually a hotel will have a flat charge for breakfast here we were able just to pay for a coffee and pastry we felt relaxed and the location is great an easy walk to the tate modern borough market and the tube stop is just a minute walk
