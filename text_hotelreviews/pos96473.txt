we were so glad we decided to book with citizen m the facilities were modern and easy to use the staff really made you feel at home from the moment we stepped through the doors and the position was everything we were looking for close to shops restaurants and had easy access to the transport system the free goodies in the fridge were a nice surprise thank you although we are back in australia now we will definitely be recommended this hotel to any friends and family visiting london
