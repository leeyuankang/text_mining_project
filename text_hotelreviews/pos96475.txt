it was a really nice experience something very different to the norm you can check in without any interaction and on checkout i was told i could keep my room key as a handy luggage tag and if i go back to a citizen m again it will recognize me once i swipe it cool the hotel lobby is amazing it is like a funky library free wifi full of sockets to charge up phones laptops etc i was traveling alone so ate from the self service restaurant and it was excellent quality the staff were really friendly and welcoming and a real asset to the hotel in its start up phase of course the room is the other attraction as a total generation y boy having a samsung tablet to control the lights and mood the tv music blinds was great fun but if you are not at all at ease with technology there are switches to control the lights and blinds if not the tv the bed was massive considering the size of the room
