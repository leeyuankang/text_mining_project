i stay in a lot of hotels around london and this is the first one thats bowled me over bed comfy and big room clean a bit ikea but it works bathroom perfect good hot shower foyer like a grown up hostel that you d actually want to spend time and drink or eat in staff brilliant friendly but not too interfering seem to enjoy their jobs check in out absolutely brilliant a self service deal which totally works mood pad well this is where you go from brilliant to exceptional an ipad by the side of your bed that controls everything from tv and radio to lights and blinds and so so easy to use location i always think it depends what you re looking for this was about min walk to tube and to the bus
