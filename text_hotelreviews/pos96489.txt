the concept of the hotel in general is great they claim to be different they are the boundary there normally is between the staff and guests is almost non existing they take an interest in you are engaged seem to be happy working there the hotel lives up to what they claim to be on their website i have been in more fancy hotels more expensive hotels better rated hotels but this is with no hesitation the best hotel experience i had in my life
