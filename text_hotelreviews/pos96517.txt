this hotel was brilliant the impression from the moment you walked in was that of a friendly and exciting environment although it was self check in on the computers there was staff waiting to assist if you needed to and to have a little chat with about your plans the staff went above and beyond for us and it was very much appreciated the hotel is located not far from southwalk tube station so getting around london is easy everything in the room was controlled via a tablet it was simple to use and fun there were free movies of which the selection were up to date and of good quality we paid a little more than we normally do for hotels but it was more than worth it i would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying here
