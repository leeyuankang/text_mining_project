if i go back to london i would definitely stay here again great location really funky modern hotel and room decor and enough room for all my stuff despite the small size of the room bed is very comfortable great selection of free movies and love the free snacks in the fridge i like being able to check myself in on the kiosk no waiting in a queue but there are staff to assist as needed being able to control all the room settings from the ipad is a bonus too
