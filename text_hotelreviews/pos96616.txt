we found the room to be clean quiet and comfortable we slept beautifully all three nights partly due to the heavy shade that covered the window and partly due to the huge bed it was nice that movies and water drinks snacks were included in the price the rain shower was absolutely lovely the location is also great the ipad as a control center was functional and fun wifi worked great the bar and sitting area looked very inviting but we didn t have time to take advantage of it
