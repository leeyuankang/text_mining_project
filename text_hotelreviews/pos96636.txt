nice vibe even traveling alone citizenm creates a welcoming homely vibe staff very friendly always making nice small talk small rooms but well equipped and modern look and feel great bed and very quiet room no noise from corridors good breakfast the lobby living room is really nice and nice place to work during the day feels like shared office space start up feeling becomes quite a crowded bar later in the afternoon
