the breakfast was amazing so worth the money as we didn t want to pay for it because we thought it was a little expensive but due to running late one morning we just bought it to save time and we ended up paying for it the next day as it was that good the whole experience in the citizenm was fabulous we had early nights and was great to get tucked up to watch a movie we also phoned a chinese one night and took it upstairs into our room
