i love this cute boutique hotel the lounge was lovely and had all of the things that are great about london food music fashion etc check in was super easy and your room key doubles as a luggage tag so you have a little some thing to remind you of your stay the rooms are super cute i enjoyed being welcomed each day by the message on the tv screen or ipad with you name also i love the added amenities such as mood lightings black out shades free movies radio stations piped in through your tv i will sure to stay there again
