the ground floor is beautiful and very stylish serving as the dining area for guests but also a very popular bar and lounge for guests and locals alike the location is excellent in close proximity to borough market the tube and the waterfront the staff was always friendly helpful and efficient breakfast can be prepaid or purchased for a higher price on the spot the food and coffee were excellent with a great buffet of lots of offerings we never had a cocktail at the bar but from the popularity of the lounge in the evenings i will assume there s great quality and service there
