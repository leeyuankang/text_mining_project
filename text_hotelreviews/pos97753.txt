the staff made us feel welcome as soon as we stepped through the front door from booking our post theatre restaurant within minutes to drawing walking routes for us to take from the hotel we were staying to celebrate my birthday and got a room upgrade and a lovely happy birthday sweet surprise in the room on our departure we were planning on some sightseeing and again the staff jumped to assist and organised for us to leave our luggage at a partner hotel closer to our departing station our room was lovely and the breakfast was good with a range of fresh fruit and a great hot breakfast selection we ll definitely book again
