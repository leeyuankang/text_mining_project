the location of the hotel is superb everything you could possibly want from a visit to london is on your doorstep the room was quite small but clean and very comfortable the staff really couldn t do enough for us and even booked our dinner reservations with a choice of restaurants this hotel was a delight to go to and we will be returning again in the summer
