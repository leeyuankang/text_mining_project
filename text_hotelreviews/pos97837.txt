we got upgraded to a suite which is one up from the room we had booked this was a nice touch rooms very clean and well equipped the attached restaurant to the hotel is a very swanky bar at night as well as resterant we didn t eat there but the food menu looked good and judging by the quality of breakfast which was superb i m sure it would be great the breakfast was one of the best we ve had the beds are very comfy and there is no noise pollution between rooms location factor was a must for us and this is literally minutes walk from covent garden punch and judies not the best place to go but we mention as everyone know where this is they have a text service from the concierge so you don t need to ring reception if a cab or anything is required just simply text we really really enjoyed our stay highly recommended
