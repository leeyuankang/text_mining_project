fantastically centrally located hotel with good standard of decor facilities and furnishings service overall was attentive and professional and would note housekeeping which is very good reception was helpful and dealt with an issue in the room promptly on arrival hotel room was in a quiet part of the hotel and of reasonable good size with a modern bathroom nice extra touches eg newspapers available and iced water in reception no biscuits with tea and coffee though this is a very nice small hotel with a comfortable feel
