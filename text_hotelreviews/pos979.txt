room and bathroom excellent really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower tv ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room hotel looks new so all furnishings modern tube a short walk away we walked to the theatre district in around minutes we did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by i would certainly recommend this hotel
