the welcome from reception staff was wonderful there was a happy birthday cake waiting in our room which was much appreciated our room was so quiet and yet the hotel is right in the thick of covent garden soho life the bed was very comfortable and the room and en suite were spotlessly clean breakfast was served by the most professional staff and the english breakfast set us up for a busy saturday we will certainly come back hopefully not just for a birthday celebration
