the staff was wonderful and the breakfast was delicious anything that we needed the staff would provide for us we could order free tea or coffee right to our room at any time of day our concierge miguel was phenominal and so accommodating to us we booked a room with a height limitation we exceeded we emailed them before our arrival and they immediately switched our room and even upgraded us i would stay there again in a heartbeat
