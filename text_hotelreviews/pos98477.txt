small room but lovely design not like a hotel more like a private room and in no you can open your window which is perfect as you are just overlooking the back of the hotel with mature trees very quiet unless you get noisy neighbours in room aircon also very good no tea making facilities in the room but you can order from the reception via phone or as you come in fast service of tea pots on tray continental breakfast is very good too really all you need and served in the conservatory very light and airy
