the room mezzanine is a split level room in a very old house separate to the main hotel house next door the place is very noisy at night i was up till kept up by noise from above and below neighbours not recommended for business trip at all ceilings are very low both bathroom bedroom if you are over tall you will struggle bathroom shower dated not the most modern i would not stay at this property again the breakfast is only continental and you can t even have a toast if you are visiting london and looking for a quiet place to stay this is not the place staff is very friendly but that has not compensated for the discomfort
