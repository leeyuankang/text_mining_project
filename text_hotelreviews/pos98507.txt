loved the beds and the water pressure on the shower was good and strong enough location was very good hotel and rooms clean and comfortable many choice restaurants and handy shops nearby the area felt safe even at night which is important to me as a solo female traveller the staff were very gracious and went to ensure i would have a copy of the metro in the morning even though that staff would not be in until the afternoon loved the option of having my breakfast via room service
