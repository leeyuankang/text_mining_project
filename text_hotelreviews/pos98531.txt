nice furniture you know you re not in a chain hotel proper strong coffee and nice tea brought to the room at any time good service good selection at breakfast lots of fruit cooked meats and cheeses pastries continuously replenished hot and powerful shower newspapers to take out very friendly staff at reception and breakfast fixed minor safe issue within minutes gave us spare key comfy wide bed no noise at all from other guests quiet location set back from main roads so no traffic noise either minutes walk to earl s court tube station definitely good value for a london location
