stayed in the ottoman suite the bed was extremely comfortable and the room very large we are talking foot high ceiling the bath in the room is freestanding and rather luxurious the adjoining wash room containing a open style shower twin sinks and toilet was clean and modern i found the room to be quiet and the overall facilities to be very adequate for the price paid the location is great too just a minute walk to earls court tube station the view from the room overlooks nevern square which is a touch of greenery in an otherwise concrete jungle the balcony would have been great to use if we had stayed in the summer mid feb was rather too cold to use it though our room was actually in the adjoining building but is easily accessed as it is literally next door the breakfast is continental and featured the usual cereals and fruit as well as fresh yogurt and continental meats i would happily stay here again and felt the price matched the quality being provided they were happy to hold luggage securely whilst we went to lunch prior to check in
