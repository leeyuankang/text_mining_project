the room was really well heated which is unusual for england especially in old buidings i greatly appreciated that it was also great to have a big wardrobe space and plenty of coathangers plus bathrobes and toiletries and complimentary water i liked the fact that the windows were able to be opened and that there were both slatted blinds and also thick curtains the bed was very comfortable i had booked a four poster room with nice crisp linen and good pillows plus i was happy to find a pure wool blanket in the wardrobe for one extra chilly night there were many different staff members on duty during my two day stay but all were friendly and personable hour reception is always good to make one feel safe the location is excellent as nevern square is very quiet but it s only a few minues walk to the tube station
