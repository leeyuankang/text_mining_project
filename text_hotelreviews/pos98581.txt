the staff were most helpful very pleasant and accommodating although there were no tea making facilities in the room tea was brought to the room very soon after being ordered as often as desired free of charge the food was delicious and plentiful everywhere was clean and the bathroom had marble on walls and floor our room had doors opening onto a small courtyard the hotel was only a few minutes walk from the tube station and the building itself looks splendid i would stay there again
