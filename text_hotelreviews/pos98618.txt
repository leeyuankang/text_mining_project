everything was better than we could have imagined the entire staff was accommodating professional and very friendly it was a lovely location across the street from a park and near the tube the rooms were clean comfortable and beautiful breakfast was delicious very nicely displayed and refilled as needed i even got my coffee with bailey s for a very modest price i would recommend to all travelers
