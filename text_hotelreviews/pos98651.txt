i have stayed here before it is an oasis of calm in london just around the corner form the tube station a few great restaurants close by easy walking distance to places like the natural history museum etc rooms are large but not huge however please be aware that the quality and attention gone into the rooms and service is beyond the usual london hotel if you are working in london and want somewhere that will look after you in a personal and small high quality setting i cant recommend this hotel and the staff enough
