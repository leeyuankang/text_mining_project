we booked this stay to have some just us time together so was hoping for a room we could just stretch out in some comfort slow down and quietly spend some time together it was utterly perfect the mezzanine bed platform is just perfect for lazing around in comfortable but unpretentious luxury bathrobes and towels were great quality and generous both in number and size it may be a bit of stereotype but still tend to find it holds true that bathrobes if they have them and towels are good indicator of the care and thought a hotelier puts into their rooms and taking care of you in this respect and all others can t fault nevern square thanks for a great stay and i m delighted to recommend you to others without reservation
