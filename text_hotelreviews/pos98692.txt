the hotel is nice is handy for the tube station and is in a quiet area the breakfast room has been added and is really a garden room which was lovely it was bright and airy and the continental breakfast which was very adequate was nicely laid out the lift is small but despite reading complaints about it we found it perfectly adequate and at least there is a lift staff were all very pleasant and helpful instead of having a tea coffee making facilities in the room one can order tea coffee from reception it comes quickly and with a tasty biscuit very nice
