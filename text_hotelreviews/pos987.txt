the location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the underground tube we also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district there were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice the staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly they also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them
