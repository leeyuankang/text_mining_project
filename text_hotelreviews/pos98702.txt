great value for money the hotel s staff is amazing always willing to help with any issue always smiling and liikable the hotel s location is super great minutes from earl s court station on the piccadilly and district line very useful to get from or to heathrow airport and anywhere in the city not too far to get some rest during the day and go back to the city for dinner or night visit the continental breakfast was great and surprisingly satisfying a lot of restaurants coffee places and shops very close to the hotel on earl s court street definitely will come back to this hotel on my next visit to london
