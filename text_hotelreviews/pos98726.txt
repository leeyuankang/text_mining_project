the hotel is lovely it s clean and well situated it took minutes to walk from earls court station the continental breakfast was lovely and the dining room bright and smart the reception staff were great and very welcoming we arrived at the hotel at to drop our bag the room wasn t ready then but that was fine they held our bag no problem they held our bag again the next day after checking out til i was looking for a reasonably priced room close to an underground station and it was definitely smaller than i expected but i knew that we would be spending minimal time in it so just the fact that it was clean and tidy and staff friendly meant i was happy
