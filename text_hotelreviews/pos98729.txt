my friend and i booked a double room as at the time there were no twins available when we arrived we were up graded to a suite and they had put an extra bed in for us the continental breakfast was good with fresh fruit salad meats and cheeses cereals juices and hot meals available at extra cost i ordered poached eggs on toast around and they were spot on the area was great quiet and within a short walk from earls court underground station there were plenty of places to eat close by and we found a little italian with great food in the evening the hotel was immaculate the staff were great no coffee making facilities in our room but a free service for tea and coffee brought to the room don t know if this was just because we were in the suite would recommend this hotel and would stay there again
