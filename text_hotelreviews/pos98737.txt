hotel is located at a residential area just off earl s court road so it was very quiet and safe and yet earl s court road and tube station is literally minutes away there is hour tesco grocery store very nearby minutes walking i usually walked to kensington high street from the hotel it took me minutes i have asked for a quiet room with a window and i had exactly what i wanted we had room on first floor two windows were overlooking beautiful nevern square room was very cosy and clean bed fantastically comfortable bedding and towels and bathrobes immaculately clean all white i loved design of the interior and furniture and fresh apple every day and also i have to mention amazing shower it was the best i have ever experienced breakfast is good you get freshly baked pastry jams variety of cheeses and cold meats muesli yogurts and fresh fruit there is also a menu from which you can order but this menu is not included in room rate i definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to london
