room was really cosy and a little quirky little touches like apples and bottled water along with bath robes and a good shower and tv made the place feel luxurious breakfast was excellent with lovely selection of cold meat cheese and bread rolls they also had a good quality fruit salad with yoghurt with was refilled regularly staff were helpful without being overly so the location was on a quiet square just near earls court station just was really pleasant with a bit of luxury at a reasonable price
