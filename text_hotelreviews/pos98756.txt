the public areas are tasteful with large flower arrangements an interesting mix of far eastern decor and country house slightly faded extravagant elegance the staff are really lovely very friendly but not in your face room service is excellent and tea or coffee can be got at any time of day or night our room was comfortable and homely to rest in after walking for many miles around london underground train is within easy reach only a short ride to any central district there are many places to eat in nearby streets some of which are described in the booklet placed in the hotel room we ate in one of those and were really happy with our food we really liked the breakfast room full of natural light through the glass ceiling like an atrium with view of outdoors tasty selection of breakfast foods beautifully laid out and great coffee in a pot our stay was really good value for money and we would stay in this hotel again when exploring london
