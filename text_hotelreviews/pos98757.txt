really good croissants and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was very pretty and cosy the receptionist we dealt with was very friendly and polite the housekeeping staff also did a good job and the room was clean on arrival the location was brilliant as it was close to the tube station also major appreciation of providing bathrobes as that doesn t happen too often any more
