this is reasonabley priced hotel in a beautiful georgian building in kensington overlooking a beautiful park the rooms are all a little bit exotic and the breakfast area is a delight in a glass and solid wood conservatory the service and attention to detail from the staff is great i have stayed twice now and nothing is too much trouble there are a great selection of restaurants within a minute walk and the tube is also very close to hand i will definately stay again
