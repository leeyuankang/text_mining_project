the staff are absolutely lovely and extremely helpful and accommodating miguel in reception was very personable and made me feel very welcome nothing seemed like too much trouble and i would definitely return the hotel itself is within a period property so has all the charm you could expect it s also located in a very convenient area close to the tube station and and all amenities of a good high street yet situated within a quiet square a big thank you to the manager and all the staff
