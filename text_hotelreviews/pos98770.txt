location for the hotel is a great bonus but a really nice boutique feel to it rooms appear to be tastefully furnished and fully functional room was warm and an extra radiator thoughtfully provided we were in junior suite staff very pleasant and were willing to assist in any way continental breakfast as more than adequate with croissants to die for
