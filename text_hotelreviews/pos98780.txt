we were visiting london for seven days and it was awesome stay despite our room was a little bit small it was gorgeous and very comfortable though the hotel has a beautiful backyard where we ve been witnessed a beautiful squirrel and a small fox from around the area sulai is a great manager and i m convinced that he should be promoted we ve really enjoined our stay and would definitely visit this place again
