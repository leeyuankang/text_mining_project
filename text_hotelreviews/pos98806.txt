i booked the hotel for nights and then thought i d read some reviews i got a bit of a shock after reading the really poor ones about horrible staff money fraud loud noise etc so i thought the stay was going to be horrible because it was a last minute booking we arrived at the hotel and i was prepared for the absolute worst well i didn t have to fight anyone receptionist was quick and friendly and showed us to our floor dbl bedroom nr it looked ok the hotel is not modern but you can see that from the pictures possibly at best it would be hotel but then again it s london value for money is ok and acceptable for the location around the corner from earls court station
