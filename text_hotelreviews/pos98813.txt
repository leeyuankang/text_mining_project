the hotel was very convenient for the tube and also a number of very good restaurants and pubs whilst the room was smallish it was kept clean and we also had a balcony which would have been great in summer continental breakfast was very comprehensive and enjoyable and the complimentary tea coffee available on call anytime was a good point
