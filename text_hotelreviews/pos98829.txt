the staff were very pleasant continental breakfast was very varied and good quality with the added option of paying for a cooked breakfast if required nice bedding and towels the room was smaller than we expected but we were only staying for one night so it wasn t that important well positioned for earls court station and good for walking distance to royal albert hall which is what we wanted thank you
