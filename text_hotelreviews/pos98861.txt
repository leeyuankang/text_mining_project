the quiet location was great as was the ability to easily find on road parking on the square we were able to walk quickly to a good selection of bars and restaurants yet open our bedroom window at night without risk of noise or exhaust frames the shower was hot with great water pressure and thick quality towels to follow always appreciated we were very impressed with the continental breakfast each morning
