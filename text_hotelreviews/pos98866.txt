found this hotel on booking com and it lived up to all of the positive reviews the hotel is ideally situated a short walk from the tube in a quite part of earls court we stopped in a junior suite that was ideal for our one night stay the staff we re excellent and helpful in all respects i would definitely use again and thoroughly recommend it
