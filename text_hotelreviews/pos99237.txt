very nice big room with comfy beds and nice green view to the street room number we liked the coffee tea facilities in the room and the bottles of water supplied every day lovely breakfast room downstairs and lots of fresh fruit and berries entrance to the hotel was closed and you had to ring the bell to enter this gave a feeling of security nice and friendly staff only a couple of minutes to the underground with different lines the hotel was just around the corner from busy notting hill gate yet still fairly quiet at night
