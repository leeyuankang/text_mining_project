brilliant location as is a stones throw from knotting hill gate my visit was purely to take part in the royal parks half marathon and fortunately i was alone as my wife would have taken half a step in to a room and ran straight back out decor is dated as the property looks like it was last refurbished in with that said the sheets were clean and the jacuzzi bath tub was a nice touch especially after a long run staff were very nice and for my purpose it was perfect
