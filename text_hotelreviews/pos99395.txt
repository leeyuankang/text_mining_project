excellent location almost next door to the beaugrenelle shopping centre the eiffel tower is visible from the surrounding streets and is about minutes away on foot the rooms are small like most other hotel rooms in paris but we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room with a very spacious balcony many thanks for that all in all quite good
