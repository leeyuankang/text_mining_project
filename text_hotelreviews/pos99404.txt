we have a free cell phone with unlimited data plan which was provided from the hotel it was awesome i don t have a roaming data plan coming from the us so this free phone helps me a whole lot just using the city mapper app alone has saved me a whole lot of headache the location is great it is opposite to a shopping mall and wlkable distance to the eiffel tower it is close to charles michel subway station
