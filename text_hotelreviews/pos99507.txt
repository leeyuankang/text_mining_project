while the rooms are small they are totally functional and everything you need is there they make excellent use of the small space and we wanted for nothing we booked a twin room on the floor the windows let in very little noise we had a safe mini fridge bath and shower and enough wardrobe space hotel staff were very pleasant and friendly the option of express check in out was handy for avoiding delays although we did still need to pick up our key at reception and also pay the room tax on check out which wasn t included in the overall price we paid when booking this is around euro per day per guest so watch out for that the location is a couple of minutes from the nearest metro and a minute walk maximum to the st michel metro and rer stop which brings you straight to charles de gaulle loads of brasseries in the vicinity and you are just minutes from the bustle of st michel the area is clean and safe and we felt really at ease there
