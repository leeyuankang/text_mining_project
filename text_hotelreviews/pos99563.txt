the location is perfect the eiffel tower was a minute walk away which meant we could sneak out before the crowds and catch the sunrise over the eiffel tower then go back for breakfast the staff at check in check out were fast and efficient a large selection of food available for breakfast go down early as it got really busy from am onwards the price was a little steep however in comparison to other properties available it was worth the money
