location of this place is out of this world you literarily get out of the lobby and here you go the eiffel tower is right in front of you minutes walk and you can be right below it you save a ton of money if you book this as opposed to the one next to it pullman which i checked and was ridiculously more expensive they are literarily next to each other staff is super nice and helpful since restaurants close at around pm and we arrived at midnight they have some sandwiches and drinks in the lobby for purchase room very clean
