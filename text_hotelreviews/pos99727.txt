the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful i had asked if it could be arranged for a bottle of champagne to be placed in our room before we get there as a surprise for my wife as it was her birthday the staff did this with no problems as well as upgrading our room to one with a view of the eiffel tower antoine who greeted us as we approached the desk made us feel welcome straight away which was really nice and we would not hesitate to book this hotel again
