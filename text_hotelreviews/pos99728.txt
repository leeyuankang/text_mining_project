we have been to many hotels from different countries but this is the only hotel that we have provided with free bar free coke orange juice water plus carbonated water and most of all a nespresso coffee refilled every day which is a great bonus they also have a free welcome relaxing bath soap and salt so you can relax in the tub after a long day the hotel is well priced for its location staff are friendly eiffel tower is just mins walk from the hotel you can view the tower just outside the hotel highly recommend this hotel
