the room we were given was very hot we said something to the front desk and were told they would send somebody they never did we ended up getting a different room the standard room was very small and the rooms needed to be refreshed paint was coming off and was kind of dirty we were provided a kettle for hot water but not enough coffee and creamer paper cups were provided but for the money we paid i think real mugs should be provided the dinner at the hotel restaurant was not worth the money for the portions provided breakfast was ok but staff was slow to refill the food second day food was cold the bed was soft and the shower was great had to request more towels being they only gave us two for a person room
