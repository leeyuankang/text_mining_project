location is excellent step out of the hotel and you re looking right at the eiffel tower which is incredible great value for money lovely clean room bathroom with comfortable beds helpful staff on the front desk even though i have a few bad points i honestly would recommend this hotel to anybody and i would definitely return it has everything that you need
