there was a nespresso machine for our breakfast which i thought was rather impressive the breakfast range was decent but the croissant was beyond delicious i wish i could turn back time just to have those fluffy croissants there were eggs and ham yoghurt and cornflakes too the bed was comfortable room was a little squeezy but the location of the hotel made up for that the train station was right around the corner walk just outside the hotel and you see the eiffel tower word of caution to anyone who wishes to visit paris do make full use of the safe deposit in your hotel room a safe deposit is available in this hotel it is easy to use and for free my mom didn t use it and got mugged near the eiffel tower area also it is well worth noting that the staff in this hotel were extremely helpful the lady at the breakfast reception returned my handphone when i left it at the table i blame the croissants for being so delicious made me forgot the existence of my phone i am ever so grateful to that lady for her honesty and helpfulness would highly recommend anyone to choose to stay at this hotel
